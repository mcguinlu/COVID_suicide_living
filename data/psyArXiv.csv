0,How did the mental health of children and adolescents change during early lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK?,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruption to the lives of children and young people. Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors, is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the UK in response to the pandemic. Methods UK-based parents and carers (n = 2,673) of school-aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child’s mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among pre-adolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders, exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of lockdown on children and young people’s adjustment. Developing an understanding of who has been most severely affected by the pandemic, and in what ways, is crucial in order to target effective support where it is most needed.",Polly Waite Dr et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-545-EB2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-545-EB2,2020-12-08,2021-02-04T17:37:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; adolescents; covid-19; young people; mental health; children; lockdown; pandemic,False
1,Is Commitment Getting Infected Too? How COVID-19 Stay-Home Orders Influence Workgroup Commitment,"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated “Stay-Home” restrictions in the United States have disrupted employees’ lives. We leverage the change brought on by the Stay-Home restrictions to examine corresponding changes in employees’ commitment to their workgroup. Specifically, we advance and test a model predicting that the Stay-Home restrictions prevented workgroups from engaging in rigidly performed, meaningful workplace activities (i.e., ritualistic workplace activities), which subsequently made members feel that the group was less cohesive and ultimately reduced members’ workgroup commitment. We also compare changes in workgroup commitment to changes in workgroup identification, hypothesizing that commitment to one’s group erodes more than identification when workgroups are perceived to be less cohesive. We test our model in a four-wave panel survey of 772 U.S. employees at the onset of the Stay-Home restrictions, which allows us to examine within-person changes to commitment over time. Consistent with our hypotheses, commitment decreased as the duration of Stay-Home restrictions increased, which was mediated by corresponding declines in engaging in ritualistic workplace activities and perceptions of the workgroup’s cohesiveness. Further, commitment to one’s workgroup declined more than did identification with the workgroup, due to the stronger relationship between perceived group cohesion and commitment (vs. identification). We replicated these results in a separate, preregistered cross-sectional survey. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying workgroup commitment, demonstrating that engagement in ritualistic activities, which enhance workgroup cohesion, is linked to stronger commitment— more so than identification—over time.",Daniel Stein et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46073-692-665,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46073-692-665,2021-02-04,2021-02-04T13:59:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; ritual; commitment; coronavirus; identification; covid-19; psychology; organizational behavior,False
2,Ideology shapes trust in scientists and attitudes towards vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The paper investigates the influence of ideology on trust in scientists. We assume that during a pandemic, ideology is linked to levels of trust in scientists, such that those espousing left- (vs. right-) wing beliefs place more trust in the scientific profession. We posit that the negative perception of scientists, a feature of right-wing narratives in the country of study, underlies this effect. Additionally, we argue that ideology has an indirect impact, via levels of trust in scientists, on beliefs and attitudes towards vaccines and vaccine policy. To test these hypotheses, we conducted three studies (total N = 1155): one pre-pandemic study and two studies during a pandemic. The results confirm the hypotheses; however, we observed varied effects at the outset of the pandemic versus later stages. The findings contribute to the ongoing discussion around the ideological underpinnings of trust in scientists and carry implications for public health measures.",Małgorzata Kossowska et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603B-C87-EFB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603B-C87-EFB,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T23:35:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; political ideology; vaccine beliefs; perception of scientists; trust in scientists; vaccine hestitancy; covid-19,False
3,"The effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a school-based intervention to improve sleep and psychological wellbeing in adolescents.","Introduction: Adolescents are vulnerable to experiencing insufficient sleep which can increase the risk of developing insomnia, mental/physical health problems and mood regulation. School-based sleep improvement interventions (SBSII) have been developed utilising Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia techniques and found improvements in sleep knowledge and behaviour. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a school-based sleep improvement intervention (iSLEEP) for improving sleep and psychological wellbeing in adolescents. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. The participants (115, aged 12-15) were recruited from secondary schools in Scotland. iSLEEP comprised of three lessons, combining formal sleep education and CBT-I, and were delivered over three consecutive weeks. Baseline (1 week before lesson 1) and follow-up (1 week following lesson 3) assessments comprised of self-report questionnaires to measure change in sleep, depression, anxiety and stress. Two weeks following the final lesson, a convenience sample of 19 pupils (14 females) were recruited to participate in focus groups. Results: There were significant improvements in overall sleep and marginal differences between those who were categorised with ‘probable insomnia’ at baseline and likewise for ‘good sleepers’. There were no significant improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress. Two themes and two sub-themes were generated. Participants reported that iSLEEP was acceptable and improved their sleep. Conclusions: These findings indicate that iSLEEP is an effective, feasible and acceptable SBSII. Future research should aim to utilise a controlled design to further investigate the efficacy of iSLEEP.",Stephanie Mccrory et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-0BB-152,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-0BB-152,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T20:06:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention; school-based intervention; adolescent sleep,False
4,Examining changes in parent-reported child and adolescent mental health throughout the UK’s first COVID-19 national lockdown.,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the lives of children and adolescents, forcing them into periods of prolonged social isolation and time away from school. Understanding the psychological consequences of the UK’s lockdown for children and adolescents, the associated risk factors, and how trajectories may vary for children and adolescents in different circumstances is essential so that the most vulnerable children and adolescents can be identified and appropriate support can be implemented. Methods Parents and carers (n = 2988) in the U.K. with children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child’s mental health. Growth curve analysis was used to examine the changes in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms between the end of March/beginning of April and July using data from four monthly assessments. Additionally, growth mixture modelling identified mental health trajectories for conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms separately and subsequent regression models were used to estimate predictors of mental health trajectory membership. Results Overall levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over time whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July. Change over time varied according to child age, the presence of siblings, and with Special Educational Needs (SEN)/ Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ND). Subsequent growth mixture modelling identified three, four and five trajectories for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems and emotional symptoms, respectively. Though many children maintained “stable 3 low” symptoms, others experienced elevated symptoms by July. These children were more likely to have a parent/carer with higher levels of psychological distress, to have SEN/ND, or to be younger in age. Conclusions The findings support previous literature and highlight that certain risk factors were associated with poorer mental health trajectories for children and adolescents during the pandemic.",Jasmine Raw et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-08D-4C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-08D-4C1,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T16:16:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; adolescents; children; covid-19; mental health; lockdown; united kingdom,False
5,Encouraging the resumption of economic activity after COVID-19: Evidence from a large scale field experiment in China,"As the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end, governments find themselves facing a new challenge: motivating citizens to resume economic activity. What is an effective way to do so? We investigate this question using a field experiment in the city of Zhengzhou, China immediately following the end of the city's COVID-19 lockdown. Using self-reports and GPS trajectory data from participants' phones, we assessed the effect of providing information about the proportion of participants' neighbors who have resumed economic activity. We find that informing individuals about their neighbors' plans to visit restaurants increases the fraction of participants visiting restaurants by 12 percentage points (37%), amongst those participants who underestimated the proportion of neighbors who resumed economic activity. Those who overestimated did not respond by reducing restaurant attendance, so the intervention yielded no `boomerang' effect. We explore moderators, risk perceptions, and a placebo intervention for parks. All of these analyses suggest our intervention worked by reducing the perceived risk of going to restaurants.",Juan Palacios et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46031-DE4-DE2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46031-DE4-DE2,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T11:40:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Behavioral Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Experimental Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; consumer city; descriptive norms; covid-19; voluntary economic resumption; field experiment; policy,False
6,Ecological and convergent validity of experimentally and dynamically assessed social capacity using the Perceptual Crossing Experiment in adolescence,"The Perceptual Crossing Experiment (PCE) captures social capacity using real-time social interaction dynamics but has not been externally validated. We tested ecological and convergent validity of the PCE, in a sample of 208 adolescents from the general population, aged 11 to 19. We expected associations between PCE social capacity and 1) quantity and quality of social interaction in daily life, using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) (ecological validity), and 2) self-reported social skills using a questionnaire (convergent validity). We also expected PCE social capacity to better explain variance in ESM social measures than self-reported social skills. Multilevel analyses showed that only self-reported social skills were significantly positively associated with social experience of company in daily life. These initial results do not support the ecological and convergent validity of the PCE. However, fueled by novel insights regarding the complexity of capturing social dynamics, we identified promising methodological advances for future validation efforts.",Karlijn Susanna Francisca Maria Hermans et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-289-95A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-289-95A,2021-02-03,2021-02-03T11:31:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; social skills; dynamic systems theory; experience sampling methodology; adolescence; perceptual crossing experiment; self-report,False
7,High trait self-control and low boredom proneness help COVID-19 homeschoolers,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) schools around the world have been closed to protect against the spread of coronavirus. In several countries, homeschooling has been introduced to replace classroom schooling. With a focus on individual differences, the present study examined 138 schoolers (age range = 6 to 21 years) regarding their self-control and boredom proneness. The results showed that both traits were important in predicting adherence to homeschooling. Schoolers with higher levels of self-control perceived homeschooling as less difficult, which in turn increased homeschooling adherence. In contrast, schoolers with higher levels of boredom proneness perceived homeschooling as more difficult, which in turn reduced homeschooling adherence. These results partially hold when it comes to studying in the classroom. However, boredom threatened adherence only in the homeschooling context. Our results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical construct to consider when educational systems switch to homeschooling during a pandemic.",Corinna Martarelli et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A2-A1B-F9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A2-A1B-F9D,2020-08-12,2021-02-03T07:36:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology,False
8,Storm Clouds and Silver Linings: Impacts of COVID-19 and Daily Emotional Health in Adolescent Girls,"Objective: Changes to daily life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to contribute to adolescent girls’ emotional health in both positive and negative ways, but the effects of these profound changes on adolescent daily functioning are unknown. Method: We conducted a 10-day daily diary study in a sample of 93 U.S. adolescent girls (aged 12-17) enriched for temperamental risk for anxiety and depression. The study was conducted in April/May 2020 when all participants were under state-issued stay-at-home orders. Girls provided daily reports of positive and negative affect, depressive and anxious symptoms, activities, and positive and negative impacts resulting from the pandemic. Results: Girls reported engaging in many activities that may contribute to well-being. Positive impacts associated with improved same-day emotional health included spending more time with family, more time to relax, and reduced pressure from school and activities. Negative impacts associated with poorer same-day emotional health included problems with online schooling, lack of space/privacy, lack of a regular schedule, and family conflict. Conclusion: Findings suggest that, when safe and feasible, families and communities should prioritize in-person or quality online schooling, resources and space for learning, promoting daily routines, and spending time with their teens while reducing conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic also appears to have offered many adolescent girls a respite from the chronic stress associated with modern teen life, with time to relax and engage in creative and healthy pursuits showing benefits for daily emotional health, which should be considered following the return to normal life.",Jennifer Susan Silk et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614B-ADE-C32,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614B-ADE-C32,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T22:23:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; daily diary; covid-19; emotion; anxiety; depression; adolescent,False
9,Infection threat shapes our social instincts,"We social animals must balance the need to avoid infections with the need to interact with conspecifics. To that end we have evolved, alongside our physiological immune system, a suite of behaviors devised to deal with potentially contagious individuals. Focusing mostly on humans, the current review describes the design and biological innards of this behavioral immune system, laying out how infection threat shapes sociality and sociality shapes infection threat. The paper shows how the danger of contagion is detected and posted to the brain; how it affects individuals’ mate choice and sex life; why it strengthens ties within groups but severs those between them, leading to hostility toward anyone who looks, smells, or behaves unusually; and how it permeates the foundation of our moral and political views. This system was already in place when agriculture and animal domestication set off a massive increase in our population density, personal connections, and interaction with other species, amplifying enormously the spread of disease. Alas, pandemics such as COVID-19 not only are a disaster for public health, but, by rousing millions of behavioral immune systems, could prove a threat to harmonious cohabitation too.",Peter Kramer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FA-224-202,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FA-224-202,2021-02-02,2021-02-02T21:22:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Learning and Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology; infectious disease; ingroup/outgroup; oxytocin; behavioral immune system; disgust; public health,False
10,"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.",Ruth Neill et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF,2020-07-01,2021-02-02T20:43:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; media consumption; covid-19; anxiety; depression; mental health,False
11,How the Affective Quality of Social Connections May Contribute to Public Health: Prosocial Tendencies Account for the Links Between Positivity Resonance and Behaviors that Reduce the Spread of COVID-19,"Although behaviors such as handwashing, mask wearing and social distancing are known to limit viral spread, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals in the United States did not adopt them. The Positivity Resonance Theory of co-experienced positive affect (Fredrickson, 2016) holds that shared pleasant states that include the key features of mutual care and a sense of oneness through behavioral synchrony, function to build prosocial tendencies (e.g., self-transcendent and other-oriented dispositions of felt unity, empathy, altruism and general positivity toward humanity). We tested the theory-driven hypothesis that prosocial tendencies are associated with high-quality social connections characterized by the affective state of positivity resonance, and in turn account for behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. We measured perceived positivity resonance at the level of social episodes either during the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 1, N = 1059, April-May 2020) or before it (Study 2, N = 227, March-November 2019). In both studies, cross-sectionally and prospectively, results suggest that perceived positivity resonance had a positive indirect effect on self-reported hygienic behaviors (e.g., handwashing & mask-wearing), which was mediated by a latent measure of prosocial tendencies. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these mediation effects to be independent of competing predictors of prosocial tendencies (e.g., overall positive and negative affect, frequency of social interaction) and competing predictors of health behaviors (e.g., political orientation, high-risk status, illness symptoms). Effects for social distancing were mixed. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that positivity resonance builds self-transcendent prosocial tendencies that motivate behaviors to protect community health.",Taylor Nicole West et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-9A6-321,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-9A6-321,2020-08-19,2021-02-02T15:43:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; emotion; broaden-and-build; affective science; social connection; prosocial; health behavior; covid-19; positive psychology,False
12,Depression and Anxiety in Pregnancy during COVID-19: A Rapid Review and Meta-Analysis,"Objective: The present study rapidly reviewed and meta-analyzed the worldwide prevalence of depression and anxiety among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Depression was assessed in 11 studies, with a pooled prevalence of .265 or 26.5% and anxiety in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of .335 or 33.5%.

13,Public Support for Government Responses Against COVID-19 Across Western Democracies in 2020,"To halt the spread of COVID-19 governments have engaged in policies that are both economically costly and involve infringements of individual rights. In democratic countries, these policy responses have elicited significant debate but we know little about the extent to which the responses are supported or opposed by the broader public. This manuscript investigates how citizens across eight Western democracies evaluate the specific policies imposed by their government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We rely on large-scale, longitudinal surveys that are reflective of the national populations (total N = 124,062). On this basis, we investigate how pandemic-specific and broader political attitudes correlate with support for government responses during a significant part of 2020, a period marked by pandemic restrictions in all the countries. We find medium to high levels of support for the government's responses in all eight countries. Beyond the regular voters of the government, support is driven by individuals high in interpersonal trust and self-assessed knowledge about COVID-19. This suggests that halting the spread of COVID-19 is viewed as a collective action problem and mobilizes support from those knowing how to act and trusting others to act similarly.",Frederik Juhl Jørgensen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B6-8EC-D47,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B6-8EC-D47,2020-08-15,2021-02-01T18:43:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; government evaluation; covid-19; politics; lockdown; threat; prosociality,False
14,Identification of relevant socio-cognitive determinants explaining multiple parental sun protection behaviors,"Background: Adequate sun safety during childhood is crucial for decreasing skin cancer risk in later life. Although parents are an essential target group in applying sun protection measures for their children, insight into the determinants associated with their sun protection behaviors is limited. Aims: This study aims to identify most relevant determinants in predicting multiple parental sun protection intentions and behaviors in different sun exposure situations. Methods: A longitudinal survey study with two measurements was conducted among Dutch parents (N=670) of children (4-12 years old). Twenty-seven socio-cognitive determinants were examined in terms of relevance regarding four parental sun protection behaviors in different sun exposure situations. The CIBER approach was used to visualize room for improvement (sample means) on all determinants and their association strengths (correlations) with sun protection intentions and behaviors. Results: Behavior-specific rather than generic determinants were most relevant in explaining all sun protection behaviors. Of these determinants, attitude, self-efficacy and action planning, and especially parental feelings of difficulty in performing sun protection behaviors, were most relevant. Altogether, the explained variance of all socio-cognitive determinants was highest for shade-seeking behavior (R2= .41 and .43) and lowest for supportive behavior (R2=.19 and .29) in both planned and incidental sun exposure situations respectively. Discussion: This study provides detailed insight into relevant socio-cognitive determinants of parental sun protection behaviors in various sun exposure situations and directions for composing parental skin cancer prevention interventions. Conclusions: Future composition of sun safety interventions should emphasize on enhancing parental feelings of self-efficacy, especially for shade-seeking and clothing behaviors.",Karlijn Thoonen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-161-6B8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-161-6B8,2020-07-30,2021-02-01T16:08:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; parent-to-child behavior; skin cancer prevention; sun protection behavior; understanding health behavior; health psychology; children's health,False
15,"A qualitative exploration of parental perceptions regarding children’s sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn","Sun protection among children is of utmost importance since sunburn in early life is a major risk factor for skin cancer development. Because parents play a vital role in enhancing sun safety among children, this study explored parental perceptions concerning sun exposure, sun protection behaviors, and sunburn in children. Additionally, the context in which children experience sunburn in order to assist the development, optimization, and targeting of sun safety interventions for parents is revealed. A qualitative study design, using a semi-structured interview guide addressing several themes (e.g. sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn experiences), was used. Data were collected in the Netherlands in the fall of 2019. Parents were recruited via purposive sampling at schools, youth services centers, and social media. Execution, transcription, and coding of the interviews was done by two researchers, using the qualitative analyzing program Nvivo (interrater reliability of d =.84). In total, 26 interviews were performed (n=17 mothers, n=17 daughters, aged between 4 -11 years). Parental perceptions and recall of their child’s lifetime sunburn were frequent, even though all parents reported using at least one sun protection measure during sun exposure situations and parents seemed often unaware of their child’s sunburn. Moreover, parents reported an overreliance on sunscreen, often failing to adequately protect their children’s skin. Water-related activities, a lack of shade, and misconceptions regarding UV-index were often related to sunburn. In addition, unexpected sun exposure or longer exposure duration than initially planned were reported as challenging situations. The majority of parents had positive perceptions regarding tanned skin for both themselves as for children. This study provides directions for skin cancer prevention efforts targeted at both parents and their children. Since a lack of knowledge regarding sufficient sun protection measures and sunburn occurrence in various situations was reported, educational efforts are warranted. Additionally, focusing on clothing, shade-seeking, and adequate sunscreen use is recommended to increase children’s sun safety. By intervening in the physical environment as well (e.g. providing shady areas), sun protection barriers can be reduced. Lastly, the general positive attitude towards tanned skin evident in this study is certainly worthy of attention in future interventions.",Karlijn Thoonen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-0F7-ABA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-0F7-ABA,2020-08-18,2021-02-01T16:06:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; parenting; health promotion; sunburn; tanned skin; sun protection behavior; children's health; skin cancer prevention,False

Our findings indicate significant effects of Covid-19-related restrictions on mental well-being and psychosocial functioning in children and adults, with changes associated with duration or easing of restrictions. Well-being in mother-child dyads was strongly correlated. For children, time spent outside and friends met were a significant predictor of mood.

17,Perceived stress as mediator for longitudinal effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on wellbeing of parents and children,"Dealing with COVID-19 lockdown may have negative effects on children, but at the same time might facilitate parent-child bonding. Perceived stress may influence the direction of these effects. Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents and children. A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-old) filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental negative feelings (anxiety, depression, hostility and interpersonal sensitivity). Longitudinal child measures showed a gradual decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in parental negative feelings and children’s externalizing behavior were mediated by perceived stress: higher scores prior to the lockdown were related to more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in parental negative feelings and children’s’ externalizing behavior. Perceived stress in parents and children was associated with negative coping strategies. Additionally, children’s stress levels were influenced by prior and current parental overreactivity. These results suggest that children in families with negative coping strategies and (a history of) parental overreactivity might be at risk for negative consequences of the lockdown.",Michelle Achterberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,2020-09-28,2021-02-01T09:05:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Gene-environment Interaction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; wellbeing; resilience; covid-19; externalizing behavior; twin study; psychological symptoms; internalizing behavior; risk factors; lockdown; parental reactivity; perceived stress; development,False
18,Polygenic Risk Score for Smoking is associated with Externalizing Psychopathology and Disinhibited Personality Traits but not Internalizing Psychopathology in Adolescence,"Importance: Large consortia of genome wide association studies have yielded more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate the small effects of many genetic variants to characterize the genetic architecture of disorders and provide a personalized measure of genetic risk. Objective: We examined whether a PRS for smoking measured genetic risk for general behavioral disinhibition by estimating its associations with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and related personality traits. We examined these associations at multiple time points in adolescence using more refined phenotypes defined by stable characteristics across time and at young ages, which reduced potential confounds associated with cumulative exposure to substances and reverse causality. Methods: Random intercept panel models were fit to symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems and personality traits at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old in the Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 3225). Results: The smoking PRS had strong associations with the random intercept factors for all the externalizing measures (mean standardized ꞵ = .27), agreeableness (ꞵ=-.22, 95% CI: -.28, -.16), and conscientiousness (ꞵ=-.19, 95% CI: -.24, -.13), but was not significantly associated with the internalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .06) or extraversion (ꞵ=.01, 95% CI: -.05, .07). After controlling for smoking at age 17, the associations with the externalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .13) and personality traits related to behavioral control (mean ꞵ = -.10) remained statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The smoking PRS measures genetic influences that contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition including externalizing psychopathology and normal-range personality traits related to behavioral control, but not internalizing psychopathology. Continuing to identify the correlates and delineate the mechanisms of the genetic influences associated with disinhibition could have substantial impact in mitigating a variety of public health problems (e.g., mental health, academic achievement, criminality).",Brian M.

19,Mental Health and Wellbeing Implications of the COVID-19 Quarantine for Disabled and Disadvantaged Children and Young People: Evidence from a Cross-cultural Study in Zambia and Sierra Leone,"Background The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantining on children and young people (CYP) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yet to be fully comprehended. CYP in LMICs are at utmost risk, given the COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures, resulting in reduced access to school-based services for nutritional and mental health needs. This study examined mental health of CYP during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Zambia and Sierra Leone. Method In this cross-sectional study which conducted from 21st June to 8th August 2020, 468 disabled and disadvantaged CYP aged 12 to 25 completed a planning tool that comprised the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), as well as open-ended questions covering social connectedness, physical distancing and outdoor activities during the lockdown. The community coaches screened individuals and families who could be eligible to receive emergency aid, and based on a convenience sample following distribution of aid, recipients were invited to complete the online planning tool. The participants were vulnerable children and adolescents (e.g. disadvantaged or living with a disability) living in different provinces of Zambia and Sierra Leone. Results Mean (SD) SWEMWBS scores for all participants in Zambia and Sierra Leone, were 19.61 (3.45) and 21.65 (2.84), respectively. Mental wellbeing scores were lower in women, younger children and participants with two or more disabilities. Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. Conclusion The results show that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.",Darren Sharpe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619D-0F0-D9C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619D-0F0-D9C,2021-01-31,2021-01-31T23:29:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; sierra leone; zambia; disadvantaged; covid-19 pandemic; disabled; cross-cultural study; mental health; children and young people,False
20,Association of COVID19-induced Anosmia and Ageusia with Depression and Suicidal Ideation,"Background. Clinical reports from patients suffering from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) reflect a high prevalence of sensory deprivation or loss pertaining to smell (dysosmia/anosmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia/ageusia). Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. Methods. A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. Results. Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. Limitations. Use of self-diagnosed disease as well as a broad array of anosmia/ageusia-related terminology may entail both information bias and overestimates of symptom incidence. Conclusions. The specific effects of COVID-19 on the senses may have long-term implications for patient mental health well-being beyond the primary recovery period. Future work is needed to investigate the longitudinal mental health burden of residual COVID-19 symptom presentation.",Elad Yom-Tov et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-BE0-010,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-BE0-010,2021-01-29,2021-01-31T23:19:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health,False
21,Learning by insight as a potential strategy to improve memory encoding in older adults,"Several cognitive functions show a decline with advanced age, most prominently episodic memory. Problem-solving by insight represents a special associative form of problem-solving that has previously been shown to facilitate long-term memory formation. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that the encoding network involved in insight-based memory formation is largely hippocampus-independent. This may represent a potential advantage in older adults, as the hippocampus is one of the earliest brain structures to show age-related volume loss and functional impairment. Here, we investigated the potential beneficial effects of learning by insight in healthy older (60-79 years) compared to young adults (19-28 years). To this end, we compared later memory performance for verbal riddles encoded incidentally via insight-like induced sudden comprehension in both age groups. We employed a variant of the Compound Remote Associate Task (CRAT) for incidental encoding, during which participants were instructed to judge the solvability of items. In a 24-hour delayed surprise memory test, participants attempted to solve previously encountered items and additionally performed a recognition memory test. During this test, older adults correctly solved an equal proportion of new items compared to young adults and both age groups reported a similar frequency of Aha! experiences. While overall memory performance was better in young participants (higher proportion of correctly solved and correctly recognized old items), older participants exhibited a stronger beneficial effect of insight on later recognition memory for previously presented items. Our results thus show that learning via insight might constitute a promising approach to improve memory function in old age.",Jasmin M.

22,“It is the only constant in what feels like a completely upside down and scary world”: Living with an Eating Disorder during COVID-19 and the importance of perceived control for recovery and relapse.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound, negative impact on the lives and wellbeing of the population, and it can raise additional challenges for individuals with eating disorders. During early stages of the UK lockdown, individuals reported disruptions to many aspects of their lives, including reduced feelings of control and serious concerns over the impact of the pandemic on eating disorder symptoms and/or recovery. This study compares data from two time points to explore the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on this population. Method: A mixed-methods online survey was developed for the purpose of this study. Data was collected at the two key time points: First, soon after the start of the first UK lockdown (April 2020) and second, as the first lockdown restrictions began to be lifted (June 2020). The sample consisted of 58 individuals currently experiencing, or in recovery from, an eating disorder. Participants were aged between 16-65 years; 57 identified as female, and 1 male. Results: Higher perceptions of general, external control were associated with recovery between the time points. Individuals who experienced less perceived control reported a tendency to rely upon eating disorder behaviours as an auxiliary coping mechanism, i.e., diminished external control was directed inwards and replaced with controlling their own behaviour. Conclusions: Perceived control is a significant factor in eating disorder recovery. As a result of the pandemic’s negative impact upon peoples’ sense of control, individuals with eating disorders are at significant risk of detrimental impacts on their recovery and wellbeing. The results have implications for future treatments based on strengthening individuals’ perceptions of control to promote recovery.",Dawn Branley-Bell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46161-1A0-A59,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46161-1A0-A59,2021-01-29,2021-01-31T17:01:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; treatment; covid; eating disorders; health; covid-19; healthcare; anorexia; recovery; control; pandemic; bulimia; relapse; perceived control,False
23,"How Does The COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Population Mental Health? A Network Analysis of COVID Influences On Depression, Anxiety and Traumatic Stress in the UK Population","Background. The COVID-19 emergency has led to numerous attempts to assess the impact of the pandemic on population mental health. Findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. Methods. Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025 recruited March 23rd – March 28th 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406 recontacts, 22 April – 1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalised anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ) and also measures of Covid-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. Results. A mixed graphical model at wave 1 indicated that economic adversity impacted on anxiety symptoms via specific anxiety about the pandemic. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. Conclusions. The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown. Adverse psychiatric outcomes were particularly associated with exposure to the economic consequences of the pandemic.",Orestis Zavlis et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46006-92B-768,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46006-92B-768,2021-01-29,2021-01-31T17:01:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; covid-19; mental health; economic worries; pandemic; network analysis; anxiety,False
24,"Individual Differences in Social Distancing and Mask-Wearing in the Pandemic of COVID-19: The Role of Need for Cognition, Self-control, and Risk Attitude","In the United States, while the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase, the practice of social distancing and mask-wearing have been controversial and even politicized. The present study examined the role of psychological traits in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior and attitude. A sample of 233 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, mask-wearing behavior and attitude, need for cognition, self-control, risk attitude, and political ideology. Epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state participants resided in. As a result, epidemiological information did not correlate with protective behaviors. Political ideology, on the other hand, was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with greater engagement in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior an attitude. Importantly, those who were more risk averse, or had a higher level of self-control or need for cognition practiced more social distancing and mask-wearing, after controlling for demographics, epidemiological information, and political ideology. For mask-wearing behavior, political ideology interacted with both need for cognition and self-control. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological roots of individual differences in social distancing and mask-wearing compliance.",Ping Xu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621C-078-521,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621C-078-521,2020-08-14,2021-01-31T03:26:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; mask wearing; need for cognition; social distancing; self-control; political orientation; covid-19; risk preference,False
25,Big Five Traits as Predictors of Perceived Stressfulness During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study examined the Big Five personality traits as predictors of individual differences and changes in the perceived stressfulness of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany between early April 2020 and early September 2020. This timeframe includes the first national “lockdown,” the period of “easing” of restrictions, and the summer vacation period. Data were collected from n = 588 full-time employees, who provided baseline data on their personality traits in early December 2019, and then later provided data on perceived stressfulness of the COVID-19 pandemic at five time points, spanning six months. Consistent with expectations based on event and transition theories, results showed that, on average, perceived stressfulness declined between early April 2020 and early September 2020. Moreover, this effect was stronger between early April 2020 and early July 2020. Hypotheses based on the differential reactivity model of personality and stress were partially supported. Emotional stability was associated with lower, and extraversion associated with higher, average levels of perceived stressfulness. Finally, extraversion was associated with increases (i.e., positive trajectories) in perceived stressfulness between early April 2020 and early July 2020 and decreases (i.e., negative trajectories) in perceived stressfulness between early July 2020 and early September 2020.",Hannes Zacher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46223-FC3-927,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46223-FC3-927,2021-01-26,2021-01-30T15:22:15+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; pandemic; big five; covid-19; stressfulness,False
26,Empathy predicts self-isolation behaviour acceptance during coronavirus risk exposure,"Health risk exposure during the global COVID-19 pandemic has required people to adopt self-isolation. Public authorities have therefore had the difficult task of sustaining such protective but stressful behaviour. Evidence shows that besides egoistic drives, the motivation for self-isolation behaviour could be altruistic. However, the type and role of prosocial motivation in the current pandemic is underestimated and its interaction with risk exposure and psychological distress is largely unknown. Here we show that empathic concern for the most vulnerable predicts acceptance of lockdown measures. In two retrospective studies, one with a general population and one with COVID-19 positive patients, we found that 1) along with health risk exposure, empathic concern is a predictor of acceptance of lockdown measures 2) social covariates and psychological distress have no significant impact.

27,"Conspiratorial thinking during COVID-19: The roles of paranoia, delusion-proneness, and intolerance of uncertainty","The COVID-19 global pandemic has left many feeling a sense of profound uncertainty about their world, safety, and livelihood. Information that can help make sense of this uncertainty is offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individuals high in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be particularly impacted by the impoverished epistemic environment and may thus be more drawn to conspiratorial thinking (CT). In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty as well as anxiety, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia explained the relationship between IU and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. In contrast, anxiety did not explain the relationship between IU and CT, suggesting a stronger role of cognitive traits as opposed to affective factors. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in IU, delusion proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global crisis, in which CT is more prevalent and salient. Informational intervention designs may benefit from leveraging the body of work demonstrating the efficacy of targeting IU to incite meaningful changes in thinking.",Emmett M.

28,Development of Parent-Adolescent Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Stress and Coping,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the extensive measures to prevent spread of the virus have had a major impact on the daily life of families. Such changes in family routines might have an impact on the quality of parenting and the parent-adolescent relationship. However, not all families might be affected by the crisis to a similar extent. In particular, parents and adolescents who have high levels of COVID-19-related stress might experience reduced quality of parenting or parent-child relationships. Families who are able to cope actively might experience limited or even positive changes in relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal, multi-informant, and pre-registered study used data of 240 Dutch parents and adolescents (Mage 11.4 years). Using Latent Change Score models, we examined how parent-reported parenting and adolescent-reported relationship quality changed over a six month’s period, from the pre-COVID-19 to the COVID-19 period. Moreover, we examined the moderating role of parents’ and adolescents’ COVID-19-related stress, coping, and the interaction between stress and coping on relationship change. Results showed that on average both the amount of warmth and conflict in parent-adolescent relationships decreased. For positive parenting, there was a significant interaction effect of stress and coping, with active coping leading to a mitigated decline in the quality of parenting only in families who experienced low levels of COVID-19-related stress.",Monika H.

29,A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19,"Aim and Method: This perspective searches presents evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. Results: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.",Lilian Jans-Beken,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,2020-11-25,2021-01-29T07:49:29+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; clinical psychology; virtues; character strengths; corona; positive psychology",False

Method: Information regarding the Israeli population since mid-1948 was collected from records of the Israeli Ministry of Health and the Central Bureau of Statistics. The British Mandate Administration collected and registered statistical data regarding suicide since 1938. Therefore, data for the years 1919-1937 were estimated by the author. Results: The study discerns a picture of decreasing suicide rates, in particular for suicide rates among women. In addition, analysis of suicide rates by gender reveals an uneven distribution, where more men than women died by suicide. Conclusions: The noticeable changes in the suicide rates throughout the years were influenced by the countries of birth from which the immigrants came. Thus, compared with immigrants from Europe, those from Middle Eastern and North African Muslim countries have remarkedly reduced the overall rates in Israel.

32,Psychology Students’ Motivation and Learning in Response to the Shift to Remote Instruction During COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic shifts in the teaching and learning of psychology. The purpose of this study was to document the impact of those shifts on undergraduate psychology students’ motivation and self-regulation of learning during the initial transition to remote instruction. Psychology majors (N = 358) attending a public land-grant university in the southeastern U.S. voluntarily completed a survey at the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Closed- and open-ended items assessed students’ self-reported behavioral and psychological wellness, motivation, and learning experiences during the COVID-19 outbreak. A convergent mixed methods analysis was used in which open-ended questions provided context and experiential nuance to quantitative findings. Students reported increases in sleep, social media use, gaming, and procrastination, but decreases in academic motivation and self-regulation (e.g., focusing, juggling responsibilities). Over 75% reported increases in stress, which they attributed most frequently to motivational and academic challenges. Students reported learning less in most of their classes following the shift. They attributed this to internal factors, including self-regulatory/motivational difficulties, and external factors, such as instructional delivery modality. Although most perceived their instructors as understanding, nearly half reported a decline in instructional quality and communication after the shift to remote instruction. Over one third of students reported feeling less certain about their future educational plans.

There was clear evidence for lower well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults characterized by large increases in depressive symptoms, and large decrements in happiness and social satisfaction post-pandemic onset. In line with expectations, a robust positive association was seen between household size (an index of objective social contact) and well-being. However, contrary to expectations, there was no association between the frequency of virtual social interactions and well-being. More empirical evidence is required before “virtual” remedies are prescribed as a panacea to replace in-person interactions during COVID-19.",Emily Towner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BD-FC8-050,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BD-FC8-050,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T15:51:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; covid-19; mental health; social; emerging adulthood; virtual,False
34,Daily Prosocial Actions During the COVID-19 Pandemic Contribute to Giving Behavior in Adolescence and Young Adulthood,"In the present preregistered study, we tested the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on opportunities for prosocial actions in adolescence, a formative phase for social development. 888 adolescents (10-20-years) and university students (18-25-years) completed two weeks of daily diaries on their daily prosocial support during the pandemic and Dictator Games giving directed to peers, friends and COVID-19 targets (medical doctors, COVID-19 patients, individuals with a poor immune system). Prosocial support directed to friends peaked in mid-adolescence, whereas prosocial support towards family members showed a gradual increase from childhood to young adulthood. Overall, adolescents gave more to COVID-19 targets than to peers and friends. Daily prosocial support experiences to friends predicted giving behavior to all targets, whereas prosocial support to family was specifically associated with giving to COVID-19 targets.

35,The ‘Zoom Effect’: Exploring the impact of video-calling on appearance dissatisfaction and interest in cosmetic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The popularity of videoconferencing platforms has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there have been concerns regarding the potential for video-calls to promote appearance dissatisfaction, as individuals are exposed to their reflection on camera for extended periods. The current study characterised current video-usage behaviours and their relationship with appearance dissatisfaction and interest in beauty procedures in the general population. An online survey was completed by 379 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in ‘video-manipulation’ techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention while on video-calls (i.e. on self or others). The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video-use behaviours were associated with greater body image disturbance. Over one-third of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, video manipulation behaviours and increasing appearance concerns. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty and cosmetic procedures. This is the first study to report the potential risks of video-call usage on body image and appearance dissatisfaction. Further research is needed to understand how best to mitigate these risks, as COVID-19 accelerates a virtual age of communication.",Toni Pikoos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46233-EA9-505,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46233-EA9-505,2021-01-27,2021-01-27T15:49:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Feeding and Eating Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-esteem; covid-19; cosmetic surgery; videoconferencing; dysmorphic concern; body image; appearance dissatisfaction; video calling; coronavirus; body dysmorphic disorder,False
36,"Measuring COVID-19 Fear and Threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity.

37,A Bayesian approach to reveal the key role of mask wearing in modulating interpersonal distance during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Creating and maintaining bonds in humans typically comes with interactions occurring at close social distances which are usually shorter than the one (of at least 1.5 meters) recommended as a relevant measure of COVID-19 contagion containment. In a web-based experimental study conducted during the first pandemic wave (mid-April 2020), we asked 242 participants to regulate their preferred distance towards confederates who did or did not wear protective mask/gloves and who could have tested positive or negative to COVID-19 or whose test results are unknown. Information concerning the dispositional factors (perceived vulnerability to disease, moral attitudes and prosocial tendencies) and situational factors (perceived severity of the situation in the country, frequency of physical and virtual social contacts and attitudes toward quarantine) that may modulate compliance with safety prescriptions was also acquired. A bayesian analysis approach was adopted. Individual differences did not modulate the interpersonal distance. We found strong evidence in favor of a reduction of interpersonal distance towards characters wearing protective equipment and who tested negative to Covid-19. Importantly, shorter interpersonal distances were kept towards confederates wearing protections, even when their test result was unknown or turned out positive to Covid-19. The protective equipment-related regulation of interpersonal distance may reflect an underestimation of the perceived vulnerability to the infection, which has to be discouraged when pursuing individual and collective safety.",Matteo P.

38,"The changing landscape of friendship in the pandemic: Males, younger people, and less educated people experience more negative effects of the pandemic on their friendships","Friendships are important for social support and mental health, yet social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic have limited people’s ability to interact with their friends during this difficult time. In August of 2020, we asked participants about changes in their friendships as a result of the pandemic - including changes in the quality of friendships and people’s feelings about their friends - as part of a larger longitudinal study. We found that people who are younger, male, and less educated reported more negative effects on their friendships as a result of the pandemic, including feeling lonelier and less satisfied with their friends, while people with higher subjective socioeconomic status (SES) wanted to make more and shallower friends than those with lower subjective SES. We also found that feelings of stress, isolation and guilt around friendship are associated with greater COVID-related social risk taking, such as being motivated to make new friends and visit friends in person. Males, who reported more negative effects of the pandemic on their friendship than females, also reported a greater likelihood than females that they would attend large parties. These results show that the pandemic is affecting friendships differently across demographic groups and suggest that the negative impacts of COVID-19 on friendships might motivate some COVID-related social risk taking in order to try to maintain friendships or build new ones.",Jessica Daphne Ayers et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46004-EC6-FA4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46004-EC6-FA4,2021-01-26,2021-01-26T10:54:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; risk management; covid-19; cooperation; friendship,False

Design Serial, weekly, nationally representative, cross-sectional, observational study of randomly selected adults in Scotland during June and July 2020. Methods If available, validated instruments were used to measure psychological distress, individual demographics and illness beliefs and the following environments: rurality, area deprivation, access to residential outside space, frequency of visiting, and duration in green space. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. Results 2969 participants in Study 1, of which, 1765 (59.6%) female, 349 (11.9%) in the shielding category, median age 54 years. 502 participants in Study 2, of which, 295 (58.60%) female, 58 (11.6%) in shielding category, median age 53 years. Direct effects show that psychological distress was worse if: younger, female, in shielding category (demographics), worse illness (Covid-19) representations and greater threat perception (illness beliefs), if urban, in a deprived area, no access to or sharing residential outside space, and fewer visits to green space (environment).

We reasoned that a broadened temporal perspective may attenuate current mental distress and tested a letter-writing manipulation designed to connect people to their post-COVID-19 future selves. Participants were randomly assigned to either send a letter to their future self (letter-to-future), send a letter to present self from the perspective of future self (letter-from-future), or a control condition. Participants in both letter-writing conditions showed immediate decrease in negative affect and increase in positive affect relative to the control condition. These effects were mediated by temporal distancing from the current situation. These findings suggest that taking a broader temporal perspective can be achieved by letter-writing with a future self and may offer an effective means of regulating negative affect in a stressful present time such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Yuta Chishima et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622A-6EB-971,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622A-6EB-971,2021-01-24,2021-01-25T00:50:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; well-being; future self; emotion regulation; temporal distance,False

We investigated whether they were addressed by empirical, international research which explored the mental health and health behavior ramifications after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We systematically searched the databases PsyArXiv, PubMed, PsycInfo, Psyndex, PubPsych, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies assessing mental health outcomes (main outcomes) as well as potential risk and protective health behavior (additional outcomes) up to July 2, 2020. Findings Most of the 80 publications fulfilling the selection criteria reflected the static difference perspective treating sex and gender as dichotomous variables. The focus was on internalizing disorders (esp. anxiety and depression) burdening women in particular, while externalizing disorders were neglected. Sex- and gender-specific evaluation of mental health care use has also been lacking. With respect to unfavorable health behavior in terms of adherence to prescribed protective measures, men constitute a risk group. Interpretations Women remain a vulnerable group burdened by multiple stresses and mental health symptoms.

44,The Burden of Being Certain: National Identity Certainty Predicts Support for COVID-Related Draconian Measures and Outgroup Conspiracy Beliefs,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced various controversies. Some people debate about the usage of “draconian” measures of social distancing (e.g., lockdown). Others concern the origin of the pandemic with some buying conspiracy theories that attribute the cause of COVID-19 to the plot of some powerful outgroups. The current research examined national identity certainty (i.e., the certainty people placed in national identity) as predictor of these beliefs and attitudes. Two studies (total N = 625), one longitudinal and one cross-sectional, revealed that individual differences in national identity certainty predicted increased support of draconian measures and increased outgroup conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, realistic (but not symbolic) threat accounted for the increased support for draconian measures. Symbolic (but not realistic) threat accounted for the increased outgroup conspiracy beliefs.

To answer these questions, over the course of the summer-fall 2020 we launched the World After COVID Project, interviewing more than 50 of the world’s leading scholars in the behavioral and social sciences, including fellows of national academies and presidents of major scientific societies. Experts independently shared their thoughts on what effects the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our societies and provided advice for successful response to new challenges and opportunities. Using mixed-method and natural language processing analyses, we distilled and analyzed these predictions and suggestions, observing a diversity of scenarios. Results also show that half of the experts approach their post-Covid predictions dialectically, highlighting both positive and negative features of the same prediction. Moreover, prosocial goals and meta-cognition—two chief tenants of the Common Wisdom model—were evident in their recommendations for how to cope with possible changes. The project provides a time capsule of experts’ predictions during major societal changes.

46,Pairing Facts with Imagined Consequences Improves Pandemic-Related Risk Perception,"The COVID-19 pandemic reached staggering new peaks during an ongoing global resurgence at the end of 2020. Although public health guidelines initially helped to slow the spread of disease, widespread pandemic fatigue and prolonged harm to financial stability and mental wellbeing have contributed to this resurgence. In this late stage of the pandemic, it is clear that new interventions are needed to support long-term behavior change. Here, we examined subjective perceived risk about COVID-19, and the relationship between perceived risk and engagement in risky behaviors. In Study 1 (N = 303), we found that subjective perceived risk is inaccurate but predicts compliance with public health guidelines. In Study 2 (N = 760), we developed a multi-faceted intervention designed to realign perceived risk with actual risk. Participants completed one of three variants of an episodic simulation task; we expected that imagining a COVID-related scenario would increase the salience of risk information and enhance behavior change. Immediately following the episodic simulation, participants completed a risk estimation task with personalized feedback about local risk levels. We found that information prediction error, a measure of surprise, drove beneficial change in perceived risk and willingness to engage in risky activities. Imagining a COVID-related scenario beforehand enhanced the effect of prediction error on learning. Importantly, our intervention produced lasting effects that persisted after a 1-3 week delay. Overall, we describe a fast and feasible online intervention that effectively changed beliefs and intentions about risky behaviors.",Alyssa Hannah Sinclair et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-66C-8F1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-66C-8F1,2021-01-20,2021-01-22T22:43:14+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; public health; intervention; prediction error; psychology; covid-19; episodic simulation; risk perception",False
47,"‘We need clear directions, if we're going to move forward. It’s as simple as that’: Teachers’ narratives during partial school reopenings in the COVID-19 pandemic","After school closures for most pupils in March 2020, following national lockdown due to COVID-19, England prepared to reopen schools to certain year groups in June. These dramatic changes in education may have frustrated teachers’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, as framed within Self-Determination Theory. The current study, which presents data from the second timepoint in a longitudinal study of teachers' experiences of COVID-19 in England, examines their experiences of partial reopenings of schools in mid-June. All twenty-four primary and secondary state school teachers were interviewed again and asked to tell stories of a low point, a high point and a turning point since their initial interviews in late April. A reflexive thematic analysis, using a mix of inductive and deductive coding was conducted, resulting in the identification of six themes: uncertainty, practical concerns, worry for pupils, importance of relationships, teacher identity, and reflections. Challenging their basic need for autonomy and competence, teachers were anxious about current and future uncertainties while navigating school reopenings. Challenging their basic need for relatedness, teachers described the importance of connecting with pupils and their families, and with colleagues. Lastly, teachers searched for holistic meaning, evaluating what it means to be a teacher and reflecting on how these circumstances have affected their personal and professional lives.

48,"""Lazy, lazy teachers"": Teachers’ perceptions of how their profession is valued by society, policymakers, and the media during COVID-19","School closures during COVID-19 have led to close and very public scrutiny of how teachers have approached remote education. We know that teachers’ perceptions of how their profession is valued are associated with morale and retention as well as student attainment. The current study, therefore, examined how teachers’ perceptions of how others value their profession have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Twenty-four teachers from English state schools were interviewed in June 2020, representing mainstream primary and secondary schools and a wide range of years of experience. A reflective thematic analysis of the interview data was conducted. Four themes were identified: (1) heroes or villains?; (2) key workers or not?; (3) voiceless and disrespected; and (4) appreciated locally. Teachers reported discomfort and distress about media reports that asked them to be heroes and criticized them as villains when they questioned the safety of staff and students returning to school buildings. They resented the negative way in which their profession has been portrayed by the media, and the ramifications for public opinion. Teachers were also angry and frustrated by what they perceived as the government’s refusal to consult with them as a profession, and their failure to communicate effectively. However, teachers also reported feeling more valued than ever by their students’ parents.

49,Stress and worry in the 2020 coronavirus pandemic: Relationships to trust and compliance with preventive measures across 48 countries in the COVIDiSTRESS global survey,"The COVIDiSTRESS global survey collects data on early human responses to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic from 173,429 respondents in 48 countries. The open science study was co-designed by an international consortium of researchers to investigate how psychological responses differ across countries and cultures, and how this has impacted behaviour, coping and trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Starting in March 2020, COVIDiSTRESS leveraged the convenience of unpaid online recruitment to generate public data. The objective of the present analysis is to understand relationships between psychological responses in the early months of global coronavirus resreictions, and help understand how different government measures succeed or fail in changing public behaviour. There were variations between and within countries. Although Western Europeans registered as more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed, and having slightly more trust in the governments’ efforts, there was no clear geographical pattern in compliance with behavioural measures. Detailed plots illustrating between-countries differences are provided. Using both traditional and Bayesian analyses, we found that individuals who worried about getting sick worked harder to protect themselves and others. However, concern about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variance in experienced stress during the early months of coronavirus restrictions. More alarmingly, such stress was associated with less compliance. Further, those most concerned over the coronavirus trusted in government measures primarily where policies were strict. While concern over a disease is a source of mental distress, other factors including strictness of protective measures, social support, and personal lockdown conditions must also be taken into consideration to fully appreciate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to understand why some people fail to follow behavioral guidelines intended to protect themselves and others from infection.",Andreas Lieberoth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B7-59D-A18,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B7-59D-A18,2021-01-17,2021-01-22T16:55:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior,False
50,"We distance most when our close circle does, not when we think we should","Why do we adopt new rules, such as social distancing? Although human sciences research stresses the key role of social influence in behaviour change, most COVID-19 campaigns emphasise the disease’s medical threat. In a global dataset (n= 6675), we investigated how social influences predict people’s adherence to distancing rules during the pandemic. Bayesian regression analyses controlling for stringency of local measures showed that people distanced most when they thought their close social circle did. Such social influence mattered more than people thinking distancing was the right thing to do. People’s adherence also aligned with their fellow citizens’, but only if they felt deeply bonded with their country.

51,The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic drives anti-systemic attitudes and political violence,"What are the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's political attitudes and behavior? This article examined, specifically, whether the psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic drives anti-systemic attitudes and engagement in peaceful and violent political activism. We collected nationally representative two-wave panel data in the United States, Denmark, Italy, and Hungary (N = 10,699). Pre-registered analyses indicated that COVID-19 burden increases desires to ""watch the world burn"" and predicts behavioral intentions to engage in political violence. In the US, COVID-19 burden furthermore predicted engagement in violence surrounding the Black Lives Matter protests and counter-protests.

52,Considerations for assessment training competencies in health service psychology programs in the age of COVID-19,"Health service psychologists have made a rapid transition to delivering telepsychology services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision of remote assessment services, or teleassessment, however, has lagged behind given the limited evidence base. This delay has been uniquely chal-lenging for university training clinics, which are equally responsible for developing trainee assess-ment competencies and providing high quality assessments to clients. Training clinics have been tasked with implementing programmatic adaptation to meet this need with limited guidance. We address this gap by describing the considerations university training clinics must make under phys-ical distancing policies, including protections for the health of trainees and clients, ensuring stand-ardized administration of assessments, providing developmentally appropriate training opportuni-ties, and guaranteeing transparency in the consent and feedback processes. We recommend solu-tions to reconcile these inherent challenges and highlight training opportunities as they relate to the development of profession-wide competencies and ethical principles. These recommendations demonstrate that by integrating flexibility into program curriculums, training clinics can continue to adhere to accreditation standards while developing trainee competencies in assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Elizabeth Casline et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-CBD-50A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-CBD-50A,2020-12-17,2021-01-21T22:50:51+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; ethics; assessment competency; teleassessment; training,False
53,Using behavioural theory to understand adherence to behaviours that reduce transmission of Covid-19: evidence from the CHARIS representative national study,"Objectives: To examine the ability of four models of behaviour, namely, Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM) and Social Cognitive Theory and the Reasoned Action Approach (SCT and RAA) to understand adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs) advised by national governments for suppression of SARS-CoV2. Design: A series of six cross-sectional telephone surveys of a random representative sample of adults living in Scotland. Methods: Self-reported adherence to three TRBs (physical distancing, wearing a face covering and hand washing), PMT, CS-SRM and SCT/RAA constructs, and sociodemographic variables were measured each week for 6-weeks (n=~500p/w; 3rd June-15th July) via a 15min telephone survey. Results: Adherence was high (‘Always’ or ‘Most times’) throughout for physical distancing and hand washing, and, when mandated, for wearing a face covering. Older people were more adherent to all TRBs. Constructs from all three models predicted all three TRBs. Intention and self-efficacy (SCT/RAA) were the only beliefs to predict to all three TRBs each week and for all groups equally; intention was the strongest predictor. The predictive utility of PMT and CS-SRM varied by TRB and by group. Of note was the observation that several illness beliefs were associated with adherence only for those who believed they had not had Covid-19. Conclusions: The CHARIS project has identified beliefs about specific behaviours, the illness and the risks associated with lower adherence rates that might be addressed in national interventions. It confirms previous findings that some groups show lower levels of adherence and might be specially targeted.",Diane Dixon et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-999-576,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-999-576,2021-01-21,2021-01-21T20:38:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
54,“My brain feels like a browser with 100 tabs open”: A longitudinal study of teachers’ mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,"Teaching and caring for pupils during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for many teachers. In a time of greater job demands and limited job resources, its impact on teachers’ mental health and wellbeing (MHWB) should be of great national and international concern, especially as it has implications for educational systems now and in the future. In this light, the current study examines 24 primary and secondary school teachers’ MHWB experiences across three time points (April to November 2020) using longitudinal qualitative trajectory analysis. Generally, teachers’ MHWB seemed to have declined throughout the pandemic, especially for primary school leaders. Moreover, using the Job Demands–Resources Model as a theoretical framework, we identified six job demands contributing negatively to teachers’ MHWB (i.e., uncertainty, workload, negative perception of the profession, concern for others’ wellbeing, health struggles, and multiple roles) and three job resources contributing positively to their MHWB (i.e., social support, work autonomy, and coping strategies). Implications for policymakers and practitioners in supporting teachers’ MHWB by engaging in more collaborative communication and ensuring greater accessibility to sources of social support are discussed.",Lisa E.

55,The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N=8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,2020-07-22,2021-01-21T19:38:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health,False
56,Low Levels of Trust affect Guideline Adherence and Conspiracy Belief during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, and the spread of the virus needs to be curbed. We hypothesized that trust in authorities is at the root of adherence to guidelines, associated with improved information and risk perceptions. Moreover, we hypothesised that the pivotal role of trust means that populism and conspiracy thinking - both characterised by a deep distrust of authorities - are risk factors in the effort to curb the pandemic. Distrust in the information sources of authorities, but trust in social media, further typifies those endorsing populism and conspiracy theories. Through a large survey in twelve countries worldwide (N = 7,755), we show that adherence to government-generated protective guidelines is driven by concern about COVID-19, perceived risk, female gender, perceived knowledge, and trust in scientists. Endorsement of core conspiracy belief that the virus is artificially created was predicted by distrust in scientists, trust in populist governments, and distrust in non-populist governments. An examination of trust in media demonstrated that conspiracy belief was associated with trust in Facebook and distrust in institutional websites (WHO, government and healthcare). This research shows that trust in authorities, associated with access to trustworthy information, is paramount to encourage adherence to safety guidelines and avoid conspiracy thinking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

57,Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings,"COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

59,Triage Dilemmas: A Window into (Ecologically Valid) Moral Cognition,"At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, frontline professionals at intensive care units around the world faced gruesome decisions about how to ration life-saving medical resources. These events provided a unique context for moral psychologists to understand how the general public reasons about real-world dilemmas involving trade-offs between human lives—in contrast to most prior research pursuing parallel questions via hypothetical thought experiments with limited relevance to the real world. In three studies (total N = 2298), we examined people’s moral attitudes toward triage of acute coronavirus patients. Our findings indicate that people generally support utilitarian approaches to critical care triage. These utilitarian tendencies do not stem from period change in people’s moral attitudes (relative to pre-pandemic levels); rather, people favor utilitarian resolutions of critical care dilemmas more than structurally analogous, non-medical dilemmas. Support for utilitarian triage decisions was rooted in prosocial dispositions, including empathy and impartial beneficence—which defies the received wisdom in moral psychology. Finally, despite abundant evidence of political polarization surrounding Covid-19, moral attitudes toward critical care triage differed modestly between liberals and conservatives. Taken together, our findings highlight people’s robust support for utilitarian measures in the face of a global public health threat. Our results also illustrate how the dominant research methods in moral psychology may be handicapped by their reliance on hypothetical stimuli (e.g., trolley cases) and could deliver insights that do not generalize to real-world, ethical priorities.",Markus Kneer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-CBF-45F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-CBF-45F,2020-09-18,2021-01-19T18:45:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Theory and Philosophy of Science; ecological validity; covid-19; utilitarianism; triage; moral dilemmas,False
60,Perceived COVID-19 risk is attenuated by ingroup trust: Evidence from three empirical studies,"Background: The social identity model of risk taking proposes that people take more risks with ingroup members because they trust them more. While this can be beneficial in some circumstances, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it has the potential to undermine an effective public health response if people underestimate the risk of contagion posed by ingroup members, or overestimate the risk of vaccines or treatments developed by outgroup members. Methods: Three studies (two prospective surveys, one experiment) with community-based adults tested the potential for the social identity model of risk taking to explain risk perception and risk taking in the context of COVID-19. Results: Study 1 was a two-wave study with a pre-COVID baseline, and found that people who identified more strongly as a member of their neighborhood pre-COVID tended to trust their neighbors more, and perceive interacting with them during lockdown restrictions as less risky. Study 2 (N=2033) replicated these findings in a two-wave nationally representative Australian sample. Study 3 (N=216) was a pre-registered experiment which found evidence that the tendency to trust ingroup members more could be harnessed to enhance the COVID-19 response. Specifically, people were more willing to take a vaccine and perceived it to be less risky when it was developed by an ingroup compared to an outgroup source. Conclusions: Across all three studies, ingroup members were trusted more and were perceived to pose less health risk. These findings are discussed with a focus on how group processes can be more effectively incorporated into public health policy, both for the current pandemic and for future contagious disease threats.",Tegan Cruwys et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-6A7-72F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-6A7-72F,2021-01-19,2021-01-19T14:32:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; group processes; health behavior; social identity; trust; risk perception,False
61,Daily associations between sleep and physical activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The day-to-day variations of sleep and physical activity are associated with various health outcomes in adults, and previous studies suggested a bidirectional association between these behaviors. The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep – physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g. inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. From a clinical perspective, care providers should monitor the effects of better sleep promotion on physical activity behaviours in their patients.

62,Information about herd immunity through vaccination and empathy promote COVID-19 vaccination intentions,"Objective: An effective vaccine against COVID-19 is a desired solution to curb the spread of the disease. However, vaccine hesitancy might hinder high uptake rates and thus undermine efforts to eliminate COVID-19 once an effective vaccine became available. The present contribution addresses this issue by examining two ways of increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: Two pre-registered online studies were conducted (N = 2,315 participants from the UK) in which knowledge about and beliefs in herd immunity through vaccination, as well as empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus, were either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). As a dependent variable, individuals’ self-reported vaccination intention once a vaccine against COVID-19 became available was assessed. Results: In Study 1 (N = 310), the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was correlated with knowledge about and belief in herd immunity (r = .58, p < .001), as well as with empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (r = .26, p < .001). In Study 2 (N = 2,005), information about herd immunity (Cohen’s d = 0.13, p = .003) and empathy (Cohen’s d = 0.22, p < .001) independently promoted vaccination intention. Conclusions: The motivation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was related to and could be causally promoted by both mere information about herd immunity and by empathy. As such, the present research provides a better understanding of the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.",Stefan Pfattheicher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-E9A-7B0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-E9A-7B0,2020-09-30,2021-01-19T09:46:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; prosociality; covid-19; vaccination; empathy; herd immunity,False
63,Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life followed by a call for knowledge about how these changes have affected parental functioning, particularly in vulnerable families (Prime, Wade & Brooks, 2020). This study uses a natural experiment design to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on parental mental health, parenting stress and three dimensions of destructive interparental conflict in a heterogeneous sample characterized by pre-existing relationship problems. Results from mixed model regression analyses showed that despite significantly higher levels of parenting stress in the lockdown group (n = 744 families) compared with the control group (n = 427 families), lockdown did not adversely affect parental mental health or levels of destructive conflicts behaviors. In fact, levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict decreased during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre-existing destructive conflict levels, financial problems and age of youngest child did not moderate any of the associations. Thus, findings indicated that pre-existing family vulnerability did not predispose for reduced parental functioning during lockdown, beyond increased parenting stress. Resilient processes and an increased sense of purpose may be potential mechanisms. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings due to the welfare context of the sample and as long-term lockdown effects were not investigated. Importantly, children in vulnerable families may have been negatively impacted by increased family time, despite relatively stable parental functioning during lockdown.",Maren Sand Helland et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A,2020-12-07,2021-01-18T20:03:45+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Experimental Design and Sample Surveys; vulnerable families; covid-19; natural experiment design; parental functioning",False
64,Unrealistic optimism and HEXACO traits as predictors of risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures during the first wave of pandemic,"The aims of this study were to examine possible differences and factors that contribute to risk perception and compliance with preventive measures at the beginning (T1) and the end (T2) of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 423 participants (M = 30.29, SD = 14.45; 69% female). Compliance, risk perception and trust in information were significantly higher in T1 than T2. For risk perception, significant predictors in both T1 and T2 were age, Emotionality (HEXACO-PI-R) and Unrealistic Optimism (NLE, Negative Life Events). Trust in information was a significant predictor in T1, while Unrealistic Optimism (Positive Life Events) was a signifi-cant predictor in T2. For compliance, significant predictors in T1 were gender and trust in information while in T2 were Emo-tionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness (HEXACO-PI-R), NLE and trust in information, for both T1 and T2. In general, findings suggest a much more pronounced role of personality traits in adherence to protective measures at the end than at the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia.

65,"Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Amongst Kenyan Adolescents: Psychometric Properties, Prevalence, Psychosocial and Sociodemographic Factors","Background: We assessed the psychometric properties of standard Western-derived instruments, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and their associations with sociodemographic and psychosocial variables in a large sample of Kenyan adolescents. Methods: We administered self-report measures of depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, social support, gratitude, happiness, optimism and perceived control to 2,192 Kenyan youths (57.57% female) aged 12-19. Results: Both the PHQ-8 (α = 0.78) and GAD-7 (α = 0.82) showed adequate internal consistency. EFA with a sub-sample (N = 1096) yielded a 1-factor structure for both the PHQ-8 and GAD-7, a subsequent CFA conducted on the basis of the 1-factor model on another sub-sample (N = 1096) yielded good goodness of fit for the PHQ-8 (2=76.73; p<0.001; RMSEA=0.05; CFI=0.96; TLI=0.95) and GAD-7 (2=88.19; p<0.001; RMSEA=0.07; CFI=0.97; TLI=0.95). Some 28.06% of participants met the clinical cut-off for depressive symptoms and 30.38% for anxiety symptoms. Social support, gratitude, happiness, optimism, and perceived control were negatively associated with symptoms. Older and female adolescents reported higher symptoms, while adolescents with three or more siblings reported lower symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional data no not allow us to investigate the onset, maintenance, and course of depressive and anxiety symptoms and our large sample was not randomly sampled.

66,COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity?,"In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of lockdown that impacted individual’s lifestyles, in both professional and personal spheres. New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity.

67,Parental Social Isolation and Child Maltreatment Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. Objective: This study examines the association of parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting: Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Methods: Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Results: Parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after statistically controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents’ perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in “lockdown.” Conclusions: Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.",Shawna J.

68,"Resilience, mood, and mental health outcomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria","Background: The fundamental challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic may have lasting negative effects on the quality of mental health worldwide. Resilience is considered an important protective factor in reducing the risk of psychopathology in the face of various adverse events, such as the ongoing health crisis. The aims of the current study were to: (1) evaluate the predictive utility of resilience in accounting for positive and negative moods, substance use, depression and anxiety; and (2) compare negative and positive moods experienced before the pandemic to emotions reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, when the country still had low prevalence of infections and fatalities. Methods: 179 Bulgarian participants completed the international online Minnesota Global Survey on Stress and Resilience in the Face of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which included measures of resilience, depression and anxiety, substance use, positive and negative moods experienced both before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Resilience predicted higher levels of positive affect and lower anxiety, depression, and negative mood during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bulgaria. A significant increase was found in negative mood and a corresponding decrease in positive mood in the time since COVID-19 began spreading compared to before the pandemic. Conclusions: Results suggest that the initial wave of the COVID-19 crisis impacted individuals’ well-being, even in countries with relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 and associated fatalities. In this challenging global setting, resilience may serve as a buffer against negative emotional states and psychological distress.",Elena Psederska et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-B3C-999,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-B3C-999,2021-01-16,2021-01-16T21:40:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; anxiety; substance use; covid-19; depression; resilience; positive and negative mood,False
69,"Noticing nature, nature connectedness and time in nature: Associations with Human and Nature’s Wellbeing during the Corona Pandemic.","During the restrictions imposed to control the coronavirus pandemic people have visited and noticed nature more. Research into the human-nature relationship often considers how visits or time in nature are related to human wellbeing. Recently, the closeness of the human-nature relationship measured by nature connectedness, and built through noticing nature, has also been considered, although rarely in concert with nature visits. Further, the reciprocal benefits of pro-nature behaviours are often overlooked. Natural England’s People and Nature Survey (PANS) in the UK was conducted during the initial pandemic response and allows further analysis of these factors. Using PANS data we assessed a number of wellbeing outcomes (loneliness, life satisfaction, worthwhile life and happiness) and pro-nature behaviours as a function of longer-term physical time in nature and psychological connectedness to nature and shorter-term visits and noticing of nature. In a baseline analysis of longer-term factors nature connectedness and time in nature were both consistent significant predictors of wellbeing measures (apart from loneliness) and pro-nature conservation behaviours. Considered alone, without controlling for longer-term measures, short-term visits and noticing were again consistent and significant predictors of three wellbeing measures. There was also a weak significant association between increased noticing of nature and increased loneliness and recent visits to nature were not associated with pro-nature conservation behaviours. A combined regression highlighted the importance of a longer-term relationship with nature in all outcomes apart from loneliness, but also revealed that, even when considered in concert with longer-term factors, currently noticing nature had a role in feeling one’s life was worthwhile life, pro-nature behaviours and loneliness.",Miles Richardson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-6BA-6E6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-6BA-6E6,2021-01-13,2021-01-16T20:15:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Natural Environments; nature connectedness; nature visits; wellbeing; pro-nature conservation behaviour.,False
70,Integrating health behavior theories to predict COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent among the American public,"Wide uptake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is key to containing the ongoing pandemic. Integrating constructs from three prominent health behavior theories (HBT) including the extended parallel process model (EPPM), the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the current study seeks to identify sociopsychological factors that influence American public’s COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent. An online survey was delivered to a national sample (N = 934) with demographic composition similar to the U.S. population. This study assessed the influences of risk perception and fear associated with COVID-19, beliefs about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, self-efficacy, social and psychological contexts, and demographic characteristics on people’s intention to get COVID-19 vaccines. Most respondents intended to get a COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. However, participants tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19, which may prevent them from getting vaccinated. Exposure to COVID-19 infections and deaths led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits of the vaccines were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines in general and recent vaccine history were also positively linked to COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent. This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent. The results point to the importance of fostering confidence in vaccine safety in interventions seeking to promote COVID-19 vaccines uptake.",Haoran Chu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-DD3-CBB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-DD3-CBB,2021-01-15,2021-01-16T20:14:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
71,Attitudes toward Blood Donation and Deferral Policies Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,"As part of its responsibilities to protect the safety of the American public, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates blood donations. One FDA policy concerns the prohibition of blood donation by men who have sex with men (MSM) and their sexual partners. The policy risks reinforcing stigma against people in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) community. The coronavirus pandemic created an urgent need for blood products; hence, the FDA shortened the deferral period for MSM and their sexual partners. Yet, the public’s awareness and support of the deferral policy remained unclear. US community adults (N=829, Mage =46.83, 50.3% women, 9.5% LGB) rated their awareness and approval of FDA blood deferral policies, and their attitudes toward blood donations from people across sexual orientations and gender identities. Half of participants were uninformed about blood donation deferral policies affecting MSM. Participants generally reported positive attitudes toward receiving blood from heterosexual donors and neutral attitudes toward receiving blood from LGBTQ donors. Participants were inclined to believe that the 2020 policy revision was motivated by an increased demand for blood donations amid the coronavirus pandemic rather than an intent to reduce discrimination. Relative to LGB participants, heterosexual participants were less willing to receive blood from LGBTQ donors, more likely to endorse FDA blood donation deferral policies, and less likely to consider FDA policies to be discriminatory. Grounded in a minority stress framework, understanding public opinion can inform the utility of FDA’s policy and contextualize the possible negative impact on LGBTQ health.",Sarah Gobrial et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46078-51F-463,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46078-51F-463,2021-01-15,2021-01-16T20:11:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; prejudice; covid-19; lgbtq; sexual behavior; blood donor; sexual minority; msm; exclusion,False
72,Probability Discounting and Adherence to Preventive Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This brief communication reports preliminary findings of a study conducted to investigate the relationship between probability discounting and people’s adherence to preventive behaviors recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 112 adults living in Brazil completed an online survey composed of a Probability Discounting Questionnaire (PDQ) and a 10-item assessment of how often they complied with the health authorities’ recommendations (e.g., wash the hands frequently, practice social distancing, stay at home as much as possible, wear a mask when in public). Data analysis included the participants who showed higher (n = 40) and lower (n = 40) adherence to preventive behaviors. Results revealed that probability discounting measures are related to people’s preventive actions. Participants in the higher adherence group present significantly larger risk aversion indices (i.e., larger h values) than participants in the lower adherence group. Also, participants who showed lower adherence to preventive behaviors were more likely to perform risky choices in the PDQ than participants who demonstrated higher compliance with health authorities’ recommendations. These preliminary results suggest that probability discounting can play an essential role in people’s self-protective decisions during a global health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Julio Camargo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46010-997-DF9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46010-997-DF9,2021-01-15,2021-01-16T20:11:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; covid-19; risk; medical decision-making; choice under uncertainty; compliance; probability discounting,False
73,Hong Kong University Students’ Normative Beliefs about Aggression toward Police: The Role of Ecological Risks and Future Perspective,"Ample social protests occurred in Hong Kong during 2019-2020 to achieve various political goals. One of the goals was to require an investigation of police’s excessive and brutal enforcement while handling the protests. University students were actively involved in the protests. Normative beliefs about aggression toward police (NBAGG→P) play an important role in students’ behavior during the protests. In this cross-sectional study, we quantified NBAGG→P among Hong Kong university students (N=1,025) and examined the associations between NBAGG→P and multiple ecological risks (i.e., distrust in institutions, exposure to community violence, poor family monitoring, poor university discipline and affiliation with delinquent peers). Moreover, we examined the protective and buffering role of future orientation. The results showed that about 78.6% students had participated in social protests and about 35.4% of them had engaged in aggressive acts during protests. Students reported medium levels of NBAGG→P, and NBAGG→P was positively related to participation in social protests and use of aggression during protests. Except for poor family monitoring, other ecological risks were related to higher levels of NBAGG→P. Moreover, a positive future orientation was related to lower levels of NBAGG→P. Future orientation moderated the link between distrust in institutions and NBAGG→P. The relation was stronger for students with a more positive future orientation than those with a less positive future orientation.

74,Digital Parent Training RCT Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"Telehealth interventions have the opportunity to scale evidenced-based therapeutics and increase service access to historically hard to reach populations, including rural, and minority groups. Behavior management parenting interventions are a best-practice intervention to treat a range of disruptive behavior disorders and family dysfunction concerns, which have traditionally occurred in person, but recently been trialed online due to growing demand and a need for remote delivery during COVID-19. There is limited and mixed information to date regarding evidence for online services and minimal research on client and therapeutic factors associated with better outcomes, which is critical for advancing efficacy in the rapidly-growing approach to treating child mental illness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (k = 24, total number of intervention participants = 1469 and control participants = 800) of the impact of digital parent training interventions on parent skill, parent mental health, and child externalizing mental health outcomes from 2000 to 2020, among children 2-12 years old, across four databases. Exclusionary criteria include programs targeted for parents of children with intellectual disabilities, autism, brain injury, nutrition/health/dental needs or primary medical diagnosis. Across outcomes, there was a modest effect size of digital parent training interventions (g =.22-.30), compared to controls using random effect two-level and multi-level models. Study heterogeneity varied across outcomes (I² = 18.6% to 66.3%). Results of publication bias were mixed across tests, but they were suggestive of a slight inflation of the effects sizes across outcomes. We tested several moderators related to child demographics, family socioeconomic status, intervention design, and risk of bias. We found the effects of digital parent training on parent skills and child outcomes were stronger if the intervention used was evidence-based, combined hybrid interactive platforms with a therapist and was compared to an inactive control. Given the limitations from the existing literature assess moderating effects regarding population characteristics (i.e. SES, parent mental health), we call on future studies to provide standardized demographics to aide future knowledge synthesis work and provide templates for shared measurement.

75,A Week During COVID-19: Online Social Interactions Predict Greater Connection and More Stress,"Who thrives while socially distancing? For this descriptive, exploratory study, we polled a sample of over 500 participants from the United States on April 8, 2020—in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when practicing social distancing was at its peak. Above and beyond other social and nonsocial activities, living and employment arrangements, personality traits, demographics, and other variables, people who spent more time interacting with close others—either in person or online—felt more socially connected. However, only interacting with close others in person, but not online, predicted greater positive affect. In contrast, people who spent more time interacting with weak ties online experienced greater negative affect and more stress. Looking at specific interaction partners, we found that people who interacted with their relatives, romantic partners, and even coworkers/classmates felt more socially connected. Living arrangements mattered little beyond people’s social interactions, except for living with one’s children, which predicted greater stress. Certain social online activities, including playing games with close ties and group/club meetings predicted greater positive affect. Amongst nonsocial activities, active leisure like exercise emerged as a robust predictor of positive affect, whereas passive leisure like watching TV predicted greater negative affect. Even during a historic pandemic and unprecedented conditions of social distancing, then, the factors that predict well-being are much the same as those already established in the literature. Indeed, much like in-person interactions, online social interactions predict greater social connectedness. However, unlike in-person interactions, online interactions simultaneously predict more negative affect and more stress.",Maureen Tibbetts et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F1-B2B-540,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F1-B2B-540,2021-01-01,2021-01-16T01:52:35+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; social distancing; computer-mediated communication; happiness; covid19; pandemic; subjective well-being; positive affect; affect; social interactions",False
76,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns: A Review and Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies and Natural Experiments,"Lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had profound effects on everyday life worldwide, but their effect on mental health remains unclear because available meta-analyses and reviews rely mostly on cross-sectional studies. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments investigating the relationship between COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health. A total of 25 studies involving 72,004 participants and 58 effect sizes were analyzed. Using a random effects model, we found that lockdowns had small effects on mental health symptoms, g = 0.17, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.06, 0.24], p = .001, but the effects on positive psychological functioning, g = -0.12, SE = 0.11, 95% CI [-0.33, 0.09], p = .27, were not significant. Multivariate analysis of effect sizes revealed significant and relatively small effect sizes for anxiety and depression, while those for social support, loneliness, general distress, negative affect, and suicide risk were not significant. Results indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies, but meta-regression analyses found no significant moderation effects for mean age, gender, continent, COVID-19 death rate, days of lockdown, publication status or study design. The psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns is small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting that lockdowns do not have uniformly detrimental effects on mental health and that most people are psychologically resilient to their effects.",Gabriele Prati et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-5AA-9DE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-5AA-9DE,2021-01-13,2021-01-15T19:57:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; natural experiment; anxiety; longitudinal; mental health; meta-analysis; covid-19; depression,False
77,"Deliberate Self-Harm in Adolescents During COVID-19: The Roles of Pandemic-Related Stress, Emotion Regulation Difficulties, and Social Distancing","Objectives: We used data from a large sample of Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic to conduct an ecologically valid test of etiological models of deliberate self-harm (DSH). Specifically, the study objectives were to: (1) investigate the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH, (2) test whether dimensions of emotion regulation (ER) difficulties mediated and moderated this association, including whether these effects differed by age, and (3) examine whether the mediating and moderating effects of ER difficulties were stronger for youth who engaged in more social distancing. Methods: 809 Canadian adolescents aged 12 to 18 were recruited via social media websites and completed online surveys from June 17 to July 31, 2020. Results: COVID-19-related stress was positively associated with recent DSH. Lack of emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotional responses, and limited access to ER strategies mediated the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH. The magnitude of these indirect effects did not differ by age. Although COVID-19-related stress and ER difficulties did not interact to predict DSH, there was a significant three-way interaction between lack of emotional awareness, COVID-19-related stress, and age. Finally, the indirect effect of COVID-19-related stress on DSH through limited access to ER strategies was stronger for youth who engaged in more social distancing. Conclusions: Overall, these findings align with etiological models that propose central roles for stress and ER difficulties in the development of DSH. Findings also underscore a need to support adolescents, particularly those with reduced in-person social contact, in adaptively coping with stress generated by pandemics.",Christina Lauren Robillard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-8E6-4A6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-8E6-4A6,2021-01-15,2021-01-15T19:26:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; emotion dysregulation; covid-19; social distancing; self-injury; adolescents; physical distancing; youth; deliberate self-harm; pandemic; emotion regulation difficulties,False
78,Sexual minority orientation is associated with greater psychological impact due to the COVID-19 crisis—evidence from a longitudinal cohort study of young Swiss men,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic and its countermeasures may have had a significant impact on the psychological well-being of specific population subgroups. The present study investigated whether sexual minority men from an ongoing cohort study of young Swiss men experienced different psychological impacts, levels of substance use and addictive behaviours. Methods An ongoing cohort sample based on the general population of young Swiss men (mean age=29.07 years; SD=1.27) was assessed before and during the COVID-19 crisis for depression, stress, sleep quality, substance use and addictive behaviours. Additionally, during the crisis, we assessed its impact in form of fear, isolation and traumatic experiences. Potential associations between these outcomes and sexual orientation (sexual minority vs heterosexual) were tested using linear regression models. Results Compared to heterosexual men, sexual minority men showed higher levels of psychological trauma (b=0.37 [0.25, 0.49]), fear (b=0.18 [0.06, 0.30]) and isolation (b=0.32 [0.20, 0.44]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher levels of depression (b=0.31 [0.20, 0.41]) and lower sleep quality (b=-0.13 [-0.24, -0.02]) during the crisis. These differences were to a large degree explained by higher pre-crisis levels of mental health problems and the personality dimension of neuroticism-anxiety. Sexual minority men showed higher overall levels of substance use and addictive behaviours, but these differences were already present before the crisis. Conclusion The COVID-19 crisis may have worsened pre-existing vulnerabilities in sexual minority men, leading to its greater psychological impact on them than on heterosexual men.

79,Locking down behavioural compliance: the role of emotion and emotion regulation in breaches of COVID-19 mitigation measures,"Objectives: Although health-related anxiety and worry can motivate engagement with public health behaviours, people may choose to cognitively reappraise these unpleasant emotional experiences, restoring their emotional wellbeing at the cost of public health behaviours. This study aims to investigate whether reappraisal of COVID-19 lockdown reduces anxiety and worry, creating a trade-off between short term emotional wellbeing and long-term compliance with COVID-19 lockdown policies. Design: A cross-sectional survey of New Zealand young adults (n = 278) during a strict nationwide lockdown. Methods: Participants completed measures indexing the extent of their current and future COVID-19 worry, current anxiety, COVID-19 reappraisal, knowledge of government-mandated lockdown policies, and compliance with these policies. Results: Despite high knowledge of lockdown policies, 92.5% of participants reported breaching one or more lockdown policies (M = 2.74, SD = 1.86). Counter to predictions, no relationships were found between anxiety, current worry, or future worry with COVID-19 specific reappraisal use or lockdown breaches. Participants with essential worker(s) in their lockdown ‘bubble’ reported fewer lockdown breaches, but knowledge of lockdown policies and having individual(s) at high risk of COVID-19 complications in their ‘bubble’ were unrelated to lockdown breaches.

Longitudinal analyses showed that all demographic groups examined (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income) experienced increases in distress after the onset of the pandemic followed by significant decreases.

82,"""Help! I Need Somebody"": Music as a Global Resource for Obtaining Wellbeing Goals in Times of Crisis","Music can reduce stress and anxiety, enhance positive mood, and facilitate social bonding. However, little is known about the role of music and related personal or cultural (individualistic versus collectivistic) variables in maintaining wellbeing during times of stress and social isolation as imposed by the COVID-19 crisis. In an online questionnaire, administered in 11 countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK and USA, N = 5619), participants rated the relevance of wellbeing goals during the pandemic, and the effectiveness of different activities in obtaining these goals. Music was found to be the most effective activity for three out of five wellbeing goals: enjoyment, venting negative emotions, and self-connection. For diversion, music was equally good as entertainment, while it was second best to create a sense of togetherness, after socialization. This result was evident across different countries and gender, with minor effects of age on specific goals, and a clear effect of the importance of music in people’s lives. Cultural effects were generally small and surfaced mainly in the use of music to obtain a sense of togetherness. Interestingly, culture moderated the use of negatively valenced and nostalgic music for those higher in distress.",Roni Granot et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46104-4E8-CB2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46104-4E8-CB2,2021-01-08,2021-01-14T20:03:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Music; covid-19; culture; age; distress; nostalgia; music; collectivistic-individualistic; wellbeing,False
83,Scared into Action: How Partisanship and Fear are Associated with Reactions to Public Health Directives,"Differences in political ideology are increasingly appearing as an impediment to successful bipartisan communication from local leadership. For example, recent empirical findings have shown that conservatives are less likely to adhere to COVID-19 health directives. This behavior is in direct contradiction to past research which indicates that conservatives are more rule abiding, prefer to avoid loss, and are more prevention-motivated than liberals. We reconcile this disconnect between recent empirical findings and past research by using insights gathered from press releases, millions of tweets, and mobility data capturing local movement in retail, grocery, workplace, parks, and transit domains during COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. We find that conservatives adhere to health directives when they express more fear of the virus. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we analyze both official and citizen communications and find that press releases from local and federal government, along with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, lead to an increase in expressions of fear on Twitter.",Mike Lindow et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E2-D12-A5A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E2-D12-A5A,2021-01-12,2021-01-14T19:28:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; covid-19; natural language processing; political ideology; tweets; word embedding; gradient boosted decision trees,False
84,Perinatal Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence for Heightened Distress in Pregnant Women Highlights the Need for Novel Interventions,"This manuscript reports on a sample of 641 pregnant women surveyed in spring 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing was at its peak in the United States. Expectant mothers described elevated psychological distress, perceived stress, loneliness, and many behavioral changes. More than half of the women in the sample endorsed depressive symptoms above clinical threshold and two-thirds reported clinically significant anxiety, with average scores for depression, anxiety, and stress more than a standard deviation higher than those measured pre-pandemic. Given this early evidence for heightened distress, treatment options that can be targeted to support perinatal women and comply with social distancing guidelines are needed. The final sections of this paper highlight the promising role of telehealth modalities and discuss specific interventions, such as Interpersonal Therapy, that may be particularly useful in treating perinatal women in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

85,Conceptual flexibility and the meaning of Covid-19: evidence from the first Italian lockdown,"Several studies highlighted the flexible character of our conceptual system. However, less is known about the construction of meaning and the impact of novel concepts on the structuring of our conceptual space. We addressed these questions by collecting free listing data from Italian participants on a newly–and yet nowadays critical–introduced concept, i.e., Covid-19, during the first Italian lockdown. We also collected data for other five illness-related concepts. Our results show that Covid-19’s representation is mostly couched in the emotional sphere, predominantly evoking fear—linked to both possible health-related concerns and social-emotional ones. In contrast with initial public debates participants did not assimilate Covid-19 neither completely to severe illnesses (e.g., tumor) nor completely to mild illnesses (e.g., flu). Moreover, we also found that Covid-19 has shaped conceptual relations of other concepts in the illness domain, making certain features and associations more salient (e.g., flu-fear; disease-mask). Overall, our results show for the first time how a novel, real concept molds existing conceptual relations, testifying the malleability of our conceptual system.",Claudia Mazzuca et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-F5B-0EE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-F5B-0EE,2021-01-12,2021-01-13T11:55:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Concepts and Categories; free-listing; semantic networks; covid-19; lockdown; conceptual flexibility; novel concept,False
86,Pandemic Grief in Poland: Adaptation of a Measure and its relationship with Social Support and Resilience,"Millions of people are mourning the death of a loved to COVID-19. According to previous studies, the circumstances of coronavirus disease-related deaths may lead to dysfunctional grief. The purpose of this study was to introduce the Polish adaptation of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) as well as to assess the relationship between dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 death, resilience and perceived social support. The adaptation was carried out on a general population sample of 286 individuals aged 18–54 years, with the evaluation being performed on a group comprising 214 people aged 18–78 years, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. The Polish version of PGS revealed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (α = 0.89). The PGS scores were associated with measures of complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression (Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale) and lower resilience (Resilience Scale 14), which confirmed the scale’s convergent validity. No relation between PGS scores and health behaviors (Inventory of Health Behaviors) was observed, which confirmed the scale’s discriminant validity. The results of the bootstrapping technique revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) and dysfunctional grief (total mediation). The results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic.",Sebastian Skalski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-7D9-04A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-7D9-04A,2021-01-11,2021-01-13T03:49:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; covid-19; resilience; dysfunctional grief; perceived social support; pandemic grief scale,False
87,Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Big Five Personality on Subjective and Psychological Well-Being,"The current study assessed the effect of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic on subjective well-being (SWB) and psychological well-being (PWB) and whether the pandemic moderated the effect of personality on well-being. Measures of Big Five personality, SWB (life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect) and PWB (positive relations, autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance) were obtained from a sample of young adults in Melbourne, Australia (n = 1132; 13 July to 11 August, 2020) during a second wave of viral transmission and lockdown, and an identically recruited Pre-COVID sample (n = 547). Well-being was lower in the COVID sample and differences were largest for positive affect (d = -0.48) and negative affect (d = 0.70). While the effect of personality on well-being was relatively robust, the effect of personality on well-being was slightly reduced and the effect of extraversion on positive affect was particularly attenuated during the pandemic.",Jeromy Anglim et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46010-2EA-6A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46010-2EA-6A9,2020-10-02,2021-01-13T03:13:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; covid-19; pandemic; personality; coronavirus; well-being,False
88,Examining early structural and functional brain alterations in postpartum depression through multimodal neuroimaging,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 1 in 10 women after childbirth. A thorough understanding of a preexisting vulnerability for PPD will likely aid the early detection and treatment of PPD and help minimize its debilitating effects. Methods: Using a within-sample association, the study aimed to determine whether the brain’s structural and functional alterations predict the onset of depression. To that end, 157 euthymic postpartum women were subjected to a multimodal MRI scan within the first 6 days of childbirth, and were subsequently followed up for 12 weeks. Based on a clinical interview 12 weeks postpartum, participants were classified as mentally healthy or having either PPD or adjustment disorder (AD). Voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity comparisons were performed between the three groups. Results: 13.4% of women in our study developed PPD (n=21) and 12.1% (n=19) adjustment disorder (AD). The risk factors for PPD were a psychiatric history and the experience and severity of baby blues and the history of premenstrual syndrome. Despite the different risk profiles, no differences between the PPD, AD and control group were apparent based on the structural and functional neuroimaging data. At 12 weeks postpartum, a significant association was observed between Integrated Local Correlation (LCor) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS). Conclusion: Our findings do not support the notion that the brain’s structural and resting-state functional alterations, if present, can be used as an early biomarker of PPD or AD. However, effects may become apparent if continuous measures of symptom severity are chosen.",Patricia Schnakenberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-422-712,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-422-712,2021-01-11,2021-01-12T22:44:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; resting-state; state characteristics; postpartum depression; trait characteristics; multimodal neuroimaging; structural mri,False
89,COVID-19 and Student Well-being: Stress and Mental Health during Return-to-School,"Students have been multiply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: threats to their own and their family’s health, the closure of schools, and pivoting to online learning in March 2020, a long summer of physical distancing, and then the challenge of returning to school in fall 2020. As damaging as the physical health effects of a global pandemic are, much has been speculated about the “second wave” of mental health crises, particularly for school-aged children and adolescents. Yet, few studies have asked students about their experiences during the pandemic. The present study engaged with over two thousand (N = 2,310; 1288 female; Mage = 14.5) 12-18-year-old Alberta students during their first few weeks of return-to-school in fall 2020. Students completed an online survey that asked about their perceptions of COVID-19, their fall return-to-school experiences (84.9% returned in-person), their self-reported pandemic-related stress, and their behaviour, affect, and cognitive functioning in the first few weeks of September. The majority of students (84.9%) returned to school in person. Students reported moderate and equal concern for their health, family confinement, and maintaining social contact. Student stress levels were also above critical thresholds for 25 percent of the sample, and females and older adolescents (age 15-18 years) generally reported higher stress indicators as compared to males and younger (age 12-14 years) adolescents. Multivariate analysis showed that stress indicators were positively and significantly correlated with self-reported behavioural concerns (i.e., conduct problems, negative affect, and cognitive/inattention), and that stress arousal (e.g., sleep problems, hypervigilance) accounted for significant variance in behavioural concerns. Results are discussed in the context of how schools can provide both universal responses to students during COVID-19 knowing that most students are coping well, while some may require more targeted strategies to address stress arousal and heightened negative affect.",Kelly Dean Schwartz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,2020-12-15,2021-01-12T19:58:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology,False
90,Predicting fear and perceived health during the COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning: A cross-national longitudinal study.,"In times of medical pandemics, protective behaviors need to be motivated by effective communication, and finding predictors of perceived threat and subjective health is of importance. The varying trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries present the opportunity to assess the influence of ‘macrolevel’ environmental factors in such analyses. Here, we investigate fear of the virus and perceived health as curfews in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are introduced in Austria, Spain, Poland and Czech Republic. Using machine-learning, we aim to find predictors of these variables in a sample of 533 adults. Participants filled in surveys regarding their fear of the virus, their perceived health state, and potential predictors of these variables, such as perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), economic circumstances, and social factors. Current local viral spread, mortality and governmental responses are further included as potential environmental predictors. Our models predict fear of the virus very well using factors such as worrying about shortages in supplies and perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD), whereas environmental factors do not contribute to this prediction. Perceived health can be predicted using PVD, physical exercise, attachment anxiety and age, albeit with small effect sizes. In conclusion, we identify interpersonal factors that are important predictors of fear and health in a European sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas environmental conditions do not add predictive value. Our results emphasize the importance of ‘microlevel’ psychological factors over governmental measures and actual threats, and offer a starting point for more extensive research on the influences of medical threats and governmental restrictions on the psychology of fear and health.",Stephanie Josephine Eder et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-C03-2D0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-C03-2D0,2020-08-22,2021-01-12T12:48:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; perceived vulnerability; pathogen threat; fear appeal; machine learning; well being; covid-19; cross cultural differences; individual differences; perceives vulnerability,False
91,Listening effort is not the same as speech intelligibility score,"Listening effort is a valuable and important notion to measure because it is among the primary complaints of people with hearing loss. It is tempting and intuitive to accept speech intelligibility scores as a proxy for listening effort, but this link is likely oversimplified and lacks actionable explanatory power. This study was conducted to explain the mechanisms of listening effort that are not captured by intelligibility scores, using sentence-repetition tasks where specific kinds of mistakes were prospectively planned or analyzed retrospectively. Effort measured as changes in pupil size among 20 listeners with normal hearing and 19 listeners with cochlear implants. Experiment 1 demonstrates that mental correction of misperceived words increases effort even when responses are correct. Experiment 2 shows that for incorrect responses, listening effort is not a function of the proportion of words correct, but is rather driven by the types of errors, position of errors within a sentence, and the need to resolve ambiguity, reflecting how easily the listener can make sense of a perception. A simple taxonomy of error types is provided that is both intuitive and consistent with data from these two experiments. The diversity of errors in these experiments implies that speech perception tasks can be designed prospectively to elicit the mistakes that are more closely linked with effort. Although mental corrective action and number of mistakes can scale together in many experiments, it is possible to dissociate them in order to advance toward a more explanatory (rather than correlational) account of listening effort.",Matthew Winn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46124-E44-CC1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46124-E44-CC1,2020-08-17,2021-01-11T22:53:43+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Audition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; cochlear implants; pupillometry; hearing loss; listening effort; intelligibility; speech perception",False
92,Visual Perceptual Deficit Screening in Stroke Survivors: Evaluation of Current Practice in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland,"PURPOSE Visual perceptual deficits are frequently underdiagnosed in stroke survivors compared to sensory vision deficits or visual neglect. To better understand this imparity, we evaluated current practice for screening post-stroke visual perceptual deficits. METHODS We conducted a survey targeted at stroke clinicians involved in screening visual perceptual deficits across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. RESULTS Forty orthoptists and 174 occupational therapists responded to the survey. Visual perceptual deficit screening was primarily conducted by occupational therapists (94%), with approximately 75-100% of stroke survivors screened per month. Respondents lacked consensus on whether several common post-stroke visual deficits were perceptual or not. During screening, respondents primarily relied on self-reports and observation (94%), while assessment batteries (58%) and screening tools were underutilised (56%) and selected inappropriately (66%). Respondents reported lack of training in visual perception screening (20%) and physical/cognitive condition of stroke survivors (19%) as extremely challenging during screening. CONCLUSIONS Visual perceptual deficits are screened post-stroke at a similar rate to sensory vision or visual neglect. Underdiagnosis of visual perceptual deficits may stem from both reliance on subjective and non-standardised screening approaches, and conflicting definitions of visual perception held among clinicians. We recommend increased training provision and brief performance-based screening tools.",Michael James Colwell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622E-BE1-0A3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622E-BE1-0A3,2021-01-09,2021-01-11T21:10:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Vision; visual cognition; screening; service evaluation; visual percetion; occupational therapy; assessment,False
93,"Ageing, Social Distancing, and COVID-19 Risk: Who is more Vulnerable?","Perceived social support represents an important predictor of healthy ageing. The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the face of social relationships and exposed elderly as a particularly vulnerable population. Social distancing may represent a double-edged sword for older adults, protecting them against COVID-19 infection while also sacrificing personal interaction and attention at a critical time. Here, we consider the moderating role of social relationships as a potential influence on stress resilience, allostatic load, and vulnerability to infection and adverse health outcomes in the elderly population. Understanding the mechanisms how social support enhances resilience to stress and promotes mental and physical health into old age will enable new preventive strategies. Targeted social interventions may provide effective relief from the impact of COVID-19-related isolation and loneliness. In this regard, a pandemic may also offer a window of opportunity for raising awareness and mobilizing resources for new strategies that help build resilience for our ageing population and future generations.",Jamshid Faraji et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-FF8-A0A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-FF8-A0A,2021-01-09,2021-01-11T21:07:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience,False
94,The Cost and Benefit of Fear Induction Parenting on Children’s Health during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective. The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was an unprecedented global public health emergency with a significant psychological toll. This study aimed to understand how specific COVID-19 related stressors contributed to Chinese parents’ fear induction practices, and how these practices, in turn, contributed to their children’s disease prevention practices during the outbreak and depressive symptoms after the outbreak. Method. Parents (N=240, Mage=38.50 years, 75% mothers) with elementary-school-aged children (Mage=9.48 years, 46% girls) in Wenzhou, one of the most impacted cities in China, reported on the presence of confirmed or suspected cases in their communities, their frequencies of consuming COVID-19-related information, fear induction practices, and their children’s trait anxiety and disease prevention practices during the outbreak (January 28 to 30, 2020). Child-reported depressive symptoms were collected between March 7 and 11, 2020, during which there were very few remaining cases and no new confirmed cases or deaths. Results. Parents’ higher frequency of virus-related information consumption but not the presence of community infection was associated with their engagement in more fear induction practices, which was in turn associated with children’s greater engagement in prevention practices during the outbreak, but more post-quarantine depressive symptoms. Child trait anxiety exacerbated the association between parent fear induction and child depressive symptoms. Conclusion. Using fear induction parenting may promote children’s willingness to cooperate and participate in disease prevention practices during the crisis but at the cost of children’s long-term mental health.",Huiguang Ren et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E8-B3B-B00,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E8-B3B-B00,2021-01-11,2021-01-11T17:00:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; fear induction; child trait anxiety; child depressive symptoms; covid-19; parenting,False
95,Homeschooling and affective well-being of parents and children during the COVID-19 pandemic: A daily diary study,"To slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus, schools around the world were closed in early 2020, transferring children’s scholastic activities to the homes and imposing a massive burden on parents and school-aged children. Using data of a 21-day diary study conducted between March and April 2020 in Germany, this work examined whether homeschooling (and parents’ involvement therein) was associated with negative parent-child interactions and affective well-being of parents and children, over and above the effect of daily stressors. Participants were 562 parents (489 mothers, Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12, range = 25-63) most of whom were married (n = 382, 68.0%). They responded to the daily items with respect to the youngest child living in their household (Mage = 9.74, SDage = 2.81, range = 6-19). On days when children were working on school tasks, parents reported more negative parent-child interactions as well as lower parental and child positive affect and higher child negative affect, but not higher parental negative affect. Moreover, days when parents were more heavily involved in learning (i.e., when children worked less independently) were days with more negative parent-child interactions, lower parental and child positive affect, and higher parental and child negative affect. Negative parent-child interactions were linked to lower affective well-being of parents and children, and partially accounted for the relation among daily stressors and affective well-being. The present work highlights the need for measures to better support school-aged children and their parents during homeschooling.",Andrea Schmidt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46051-633-C9E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46051-633-C9E,2020-10-14,2021-01-11T07:01:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; parenting; homeschooling; affective well-being; parent-child dyad; covid-19; ambulatory assessment; daily diary study,False
96,Temporal Distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Letter Writing with Future Self can Mitigate Negative Affect,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading across the world, threatening not only physical health but also psychological well-being. We reasoned that a broadened temporal perspective may attenuate current mental distress and tested a letter-writing manipulation designed to connect people to their post-COVID-19 future selves. Participants were randomly assigned to either send a letter to their future self (letter-to-future), send a letter to present self from the perspective of future self (letter-from-future), or a control condition. Participants in both letter-writing conditions showed immediate decrease in negative affect and increase in positive affect relative to the control condition. These effects were mediated by temporal distancing from the current situation. These findings suggest that taking a broader temporal perspective can be achieved by letter-writing with a future self and may offer an effective means of regulating negative affect in a stressful present time such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Yuta Chishima et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46116-17D-8C3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46116-17D-8C3,2021-01-02,2021-01-10T22:52:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; temporal distance; well-being; emotion regulation; future self,False
97,Pre-pandemic suicidal ideation and preventive behavior during COVID-19: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Cross-sectional studies have shown associations between suicide risk factors and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Aims: We investigated the impact of suicidal ideation on COVID-19 preventive behaviors to augment literature focused on suicide risk factors and COVID-19 preventive health measures. Significant findings may reveal factors that explain dangerous behavior and inspire policy to mitigate negative health outcomes. Method: This study used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6683). A baseline survey (January 24, 2020 = before COVID-19 pandemic, T1) and a follow-up survey (between April 27 and April 30, 2020 = during COVID-19 pandemic, T2) were conducted among the general adult population in Japan. Results: Adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors, high suicidal ideation at T1 was associated with significantly low levels of engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviors at T2. Limitations: As this was an Internet survey and contained selection bias, the sample may not be representative of the general population in Japan. Pandemic severity may impact results in other geographies, reducing the applicability of study findings. Conclusion: Individuals with strong suicidal ideation before the pandemic were less likely to engage in COVID-19 preventive behaviors.

98,Remote Cognitive Assessment in Psychiatry: A Scoping Review,"Background: Many individuals living with mental illness present cognitive deficits and reasoning biases negatively impacting clinical and functional trajectories. Within the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers must adapt traditional in-person assessments for remote delivery, but little guidance is available for this endeavor. To synthesize the literature and facilitate guideline development, we conducted a scoping review of remote cognitive assessment in psychiatry. Objectives: We sought to (1) map the literature, (2) identify potential barriers and facilitators, and (3) highlight current knowledge gaps of remote cognitive assessment in psychiatry. Eligibility Criteria: Articles were selected based on the following criteria: (a) peer-reviewed; (b) included individuals with a diagnosis of a severe mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia-spectrum disorders); and (c) reported on remote assessment of cognitive capacity or cognitive biases. Information and Evidence Sources: Our literature search was conducted using the OVID and EBSCO databases. Additionally, repositories of tests (PsycTESTS, Health and Psychosocial Instruments, Mental Measurements Yearbook) were searched, experts in the field were contacted for unpublished findings, and reference lists of selected articles were examined for additional studies. Evidence sources included original research articles, reviews and letters to the editor. Charting Methods: Data extraction was performed according to a predetermined form, defining study parameters, remote measure characteristics, psychometric properties, facilitators, barriers, and future directions. Extracted data were synthesized and illustrated using the logic model methodology. Results: Of 25,374 retrieved articles, 32 articles were selected, including 80 different measures across 11 cognitive domains and four remote platforms. Remote measures were generally comparable to traditional versions, though psychometric properties were infrequently reported. Facilitators included standardized procedures and wider recruitment, whereas barriers included imprecise measure adaptations, technology inaccessibility, low patient engagement and poor digital literacy. Conclusions: Our review identified several potential remote cognitive assessment measures used in psychiatry across all cognitive domains. However, there is a need for more rigorous validation of these measures as well as development of new open source alternatives, and consideration of potential influential factors, such as sex and gender. We discuss implications for conducting remote cognitive assessment in psychiatry and fostering high quality research using digital technologies.",Katie M.

99,"An Exploration of Staff Member’s Experiences of Receiving Clinical Supervision using Virtual Platforms, during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Abstract Background: Supervision is an integral part of standard practice within Clinical Psychology. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, much of the UK’s population were required to work from home, leading to an increase in supervision being conducted via virtual platforms. Objective: To explore clinical health psychology staff members’ experiences of receiving supervision virtually. Method: A mixed-methods approach was adopted to explore 12 practitioners experience of remote supervision. This was completed online and consisted of the Supervisory Relationship Questionnaire and eight open-ended questions. Descriptive data were analysed using Microsoft Excel and qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participant’s ratings of the supervisory relationship were high. Overall, practitioners found virtual supervision positive, but still preferred face to face supervision. Clinician’s reported that the pre-established relationship with supervisors was important and building a new supervisory relationship virtually was more challenging. Discussion: This study highlights the importance of monitoring supervisory relationships whilst supervision is delivered virtually. Recommendations made by participants for virtual supervision should be used to support this.",Frances Chaisty et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-5FE-B92,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-5FE-B92,2021-01-09,2021-01-09T22:19:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; thematic analysis; virtual; supervisory relationship; covid-19; qualitative; supervision; clinical psychology,False
100,Prenatal care disruptions and associations with maternal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread across Canada in March 2020, provinces imposed strict lockdowns causing restrictions and disruptions to health care. These changes impacted how pregnant individuals received prenatal care and experienced childbirth. The additional stress caused by these changes may negatively affect the well-being of pregnant individuals and the developing child. This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and birth plans of pregnant individuals in Canada and potential associations with maternal mental health. Data from 4604 participants was collected from English- and French-speaking Canadians between April 5-June 1, 2020 as part of the Canada-wide Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic study. Symptoms of maternal depression, general anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety were assessed. Participants also answered questions about disruptions and changes to prenatal care and their birth plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between prenatal care disruptions and maternal mental health. Cancellation of prenatal appointments and birth plan changes (specifically changes to childcare during birth and change of support person attending the birth) were significantly associated with greater odds of experiencing clinically-elevated depression, anxiety, and/or pregnancy-related anxiety symptoms. These results illustrate the need for reliable and accessible prenatal care during the pandemic, such as the integration of mental health screenings and co-ordination of prenatal care providers.",Taylor Groulx et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-941-448,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-941-448,2021-01-04,2021-01-09T22:12:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depression; prenatal care; pregnancy; stress; anxiety; pandemic; covid-19,False
101,The Effects of Organizational Climate on Adherence to Guidelines for COVID-19 Prevention and Organizational Identification: A Three-Wave Study,"During the current pandemic, it is essential that people follow the COVID-19 guidelines (e.g., physical distancing). Organizations substantially affect their employees’ behavior in a wide range of areas, but can they also affect how strictly employees adhere to COVID-19 guidelines? To answer this question, the present study examined the impact of an organizational climate for preventing infectious diseases (OCID) on employees’ adherence to COVID-19 guidelines both at work and in their private life. Using a three-wave longitudinal online survey with N = 304 UK based workers, our results show that OCID during the lockdown in April 2020 (T2) was positively linked to adherence to COVID-19 guidelines at work one month later (T3). We also found a relationship between OCID (T2) and adherence in one’s private life (T3) that was fully mediated through adherence at work (T3). Furthermore, we found that a pre-pandemic health climate (T1) was positively linked to our novel measure of organizational climate (T2). Finally, our study revealed that OCID (T2) and a pre-pandemic health climate (T1) contribute to stronger organizational and team identification (T3). These results highlight the key role organizations play in mitigating the current pandemic.",Philipp Hubert et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46169-841-04E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46169-841-04E,2021-01-07,2021-01-09T16:09:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Organizational Culture,False
102,Viral Tunes: Changes in musical behaviours and interest in coronamusic predict socio-emotional coping during COVID-19 lockdown,"Beyond immediate health risks, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a variety of stressors, which may require expensive or unavailable strategies during a pandemic (e.g., therapy, socialising). Here we asked whether musical engagement is an effective strategy for socio-emotional coping. During the first lockdown period (April-May 2020), we surveyed changes in music listening and making behaviours of over 5000 people, with representative samples from 3 continents. More than half of respondents reported using music to cope. People experiencing increased negative emotions used music for solitary emotional regulation, whereas people experiencing increased positive emotions used music as a proxy for social interaction. Light gradient-boosted regressor models were used to identify the most important predictors of an individual’s use of music to cope, the foremost of which was, intriguingly, their interest in the novel genre of “coronamusic.” Overall, our results emphasise the importance of real-time musical responses to societal crises, as well as individually tailored adaptations in musical behaviours to meet socio-emotional needs.",Lauren Fink et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-6E0-C09,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-6E0-C09,2021-01-09,2021-01-09T16:02:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Music; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; music; coronamusic; big data; emotions; covid-19; coping; machine learning; social; wellbeing; lockdown,False
103,Examining the Left-Right Divide through the Lens of a Global Crisis: Ideological Differences and Their Implications for Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 disease pandemic is one of the most pressing global health issues of our time. Nevertheless, responses to the pandemic exhibit a stark ideological divide, with political conservatives (versus liberals/progressives) expressing less concern about the virus and less behavioral compliance with efforts to combat it. Drawing from decades of research on the psychological underpinnings of ideology, in four studies (total N = 4,441) we examine the factors that contribute to the ideological gap in pandemic response—across domains including personality (e.g., empathic concern), attitudes (e.g., trust in science), information (e.g., COVID-19 knowledge), vulnerability (e.g., preexisting medical conditions), demographics (e.g., education, income) and environment (e.g., local COVID-19 infection rates). This work provides insight into the most proximal drivers of this ideological divide, and also helps fill a longstanding theoretical and empirical gap regarding how these various ideological differences shape responses to complex real-world sociopolitical events. Among our key findings are the central role of attitude- and belief-related factors (e.g., trust in science and trust in Trump)—and the relatively weak influence of more domain-general personality factors (e.g., empathic concern, disgust sensitivity). We conclude by considering possible explanations for these findings and their broader implications for our understanding of political ideology.",Benjamin Ruisch et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601F-37D-4A1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601F-37D-4A1,2021-01-05,2021-01-09T15:51:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; covid-19; ideology; individual differences; politics,False
104,Information Delivered by a Chatbot Has a Positive Impact on COVID-19 Vaccines Attitudes and Intentions,"The COVID-19 vaccines will not end the pandemic if they stay in freezers. In many countries, such as France, COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy is high. It is crucial that governments make it as easy as possible for people who want to be vaccinated to do so, but also that they devise communication strategies to address the concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals. We introduce and test on 701 French participants a novel messaging strategy: a chatbot that answers people’s questions about COVID-19 vaccines. We find that interacting with this chatbot for a few minutes significantly increases people’s intentions to get vaccinated (ß = 0.12) and has a positive impact on their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination (ß = 0.23). Our results suggest that a properly scripted and regularly updated chatbot could offer a powerful resource to help fight hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines.",Sacha Altay et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B8-83D-909,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B8-83D-909,2021-01-04,2021-01-09T15:39:54+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; attitude change; covid-19 vaccines; covid-19; vaccination; chatbot; vaccine refusal",False
105,Prosocial behavior promotes positive emotion during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant threat to humans’ physical and mental wellbeing. In response, there has been an urgent “call to action” for psychological interventions that enhance positive emotion and psychological resilience. Extending upon past research documenting the wellbeing benefits of generous action, we conducted two online pre-registered experiments (N =1,623) during the pandemic in which participants were randomly assigned to engage in other- or self-beneficial action. Specifically, participants made charitable donations or gained money for themselves (Experiment 1); purchased COVID-19-related or COVID-19-unrelated items for someone else or for themselves (Experiment 2). Results showed that prosocial behavior led to greater positive affect, meaningfulness, empathy and social connectedness. Affect benefits were detectable whether prosocial spending was COVID-19-related or not. These findings provide support for one strategy to bolster wellbeing during the pandemic – generous action – which may also promote cooperation and social cohesiveness needed to contain and overcome the virus.",Mohith Mukund Varma et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B0-D75-DE8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B0-D75-DE8,2020-08-12,2021-01-09T05:52:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; mental wellbeing; covid-19; pandemic; prosocial behavior; positive emotion,False
106,Questionable Research Practices among Faculty and Students in APA-accredited Clinical and Counseling Psychology Doctoral Programs,"This study examines self-reported engagement in questionable research practices (QRPs) by faculty (N = 164) and students (N = 110) in American Psychological Association (APA)-accredited clinical and counseling psychology doctoral programs. Both faculty and student participants were asked to report their own engagement as well as the engagement of their graduate school mentor in 12 QRPs. Nearly 65% of the faculty participants and 50% of the student participants reported engaging in at least one QRP. The most commonly reported QRP was selectively reporting findings that worked (35% for faculty, 26% for students) and the least commonly admitted was falsifying data (0% for faculty, 1% for students). Total number of QRPs engaged in was significantly predicted by knowledge of mentor engagement in QRPs (explaining 34% of the variance for faculty and 19% of the variance for students), but it was not predicted by degree year, number of publications, or self-reported researcher reputation. These results suggest that QRPs do occur in the field, but perhaps at lower levels than had previously been thought. They also suggest that additional training in QRPs is needed.

107,The Social and Psychological Changes of the First Months of COVID-19,"The initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the lives of people across the globe. The current research sought to understand how the pandemic affected people’s social and psychological states during the first three months after the first U.S. death was reported. How did people’s emotions, thought patterns, and social lives change as the pandemic unfolded? The Reddit language of 200,000+ people across 18 cities in the U.S. was analyzed along with surveys from 11,000+ people in the U.S. and Canada. Overall, large psychological shifts were found that reflected three distinct phases. As the first COVID warnings emerged but prior to the shelter-in-place directives, people’s attentional focus switched to the impending threat. Anxiety levels surged, and positive emotion and anger dropped. In parallel, people’s thinking became more immediate and intuitive rather than analytic. When cities began lockdowns, anxiety levels spiked and sadness increased, and language shifted in ways that revealed people’s attempts to make sense of the situation. Six weeks after the onset, people’s psychological states stabilized but the COVID-produced changes had not abated. Converging evidence from survey responses and natural language analysis indicated that people’s ties with family strengthened but that social ties to broader groups (friends, city, and country) weakened. The psychological shifts were amplified on days when the country’s and cities’ COVID infection growth rates were higher, marking the link between the pandemic and the observed psychological patterns. Together, the study underscores the large psychological impacts across the country during the first three months of the crisis.",Ashwini Ashokkumar et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EE-872-756,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EE-872-756,2021-01-03,2021-01-07T19:04:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; covid; collective upheaval; covid-19; epidemic; pandemic; language; temporal change,False
108,Preprint: Parent-reported social-communication changes in Children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.,"The current coronavirus pandemic has swept across the United Kingdom (UK), causing the devolved governments to implement nationwide lockdowns and local restrictions. Given the ever-evolving situation, little is known about the repercussions of coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns for children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the hallmark features of ASD, such as chronic social-communication challenges, put autistic children at greater risk of being negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, this study explores the social-communicative impact of the first lockdown (March 2020 – July 2020) in the UK and the return to school period (September 2020 – October 2020), following prolonged disruption to routine, in children diagnosed with ASD. 176 parents of autistic children from across the UK completed 2 separate online surveys. The results suggested that self-regulation skills ( P < .05) and co-operation skills ( P < .05) were most affected over the course of the lockdown. Additionally, children’s physical activity levels were perceived to significantly increase during the return to school (P < .0001), and this was positively associated with better social-communication outcomes (P < .05). The results also suggested the importance of school support (P < .01), maintaining contact with friends and family during the lockdown period (P < .01), and also attending school regularly during the return to school period (P < .01) for protecting against social skills worsening during these times. Future work is needed to confirm and further explore the findings of this study. Such work could be implemented to protect and improve the social-communicative outcomes of autistic children.",Phoebe Morris et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-99F-9E4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-99F-9E4,2021-01-06,2021-01-06T18:40:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; children; communication; autism spectrum disorder; social development; covid-19; coronavirus; autism,False
109,Canadian Adolescents’ Mental Health and Substance Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations with COVID-19 Stressors,"Objective: There have been significant concerns regarding the mental health impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), due to isolation, anxiety around the pandemic, and increased conflict in the home. The purpose of this study was to examine the rates of mental health problems and substance use, and to assess which COVID-19 related stressors were predictors of mental health and substance use in a large Canadian sample of adolescents, with comparisons across genders. Method: Participants (N = 809, Mage = 15.67, SD = 1.37) identified as a girl (56.2%), boy (38.7%), or trans/non-binary individual (TNBI; 5.1%) and were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. Results: A high proportion of adolescents met clinical cut-offs for depression (51%), anxiety (39%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (45%). Other mental health problems ranged from 9%-20%. Adolescents were mainly concerned with the health of family members and vulnerable populations, as well as the increased family stress at home during COVID-19. Rates of substance use were higher than expected, with over 50% of youth engaging in some form of substance use in the past 90 days, and almost 20% engaging in substance use at least once a week. TNBI and girls reported higher rates of mental health problems compared to boys. Family stress due to confinement and violence at home predicted higher rates of mental health, but not substance use problems. Conclusions: Increased rates of mental health problems and substance use necessitate targeted supports that encourage positive coping amidst the additional stresses of COVID-19.",Stephanie Craig et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-B69-698,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-B69-698,2020-09-09,2021-01-06T16:56:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology,False
110,"Basketball jones: Fan passion, motives, and reactions to the suspension of the National Basketball Association season due to COVID-19","The suspension of the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that NBA fans were unable to engage in an activity that they loved in the midst of a global health crisis. In this research, we assessed if fan responses to the suspension were associated with different types of fan passion and motives. Shortly after the NBA season suspension, NBA fans (N = 395) completed online surveys assessing harmonious and obsessive passion for being an NBA fan, motives for watching games, and various attitudes and responses to the suspension. We found that both fan passion and motives predicted responses to the suspension, particularly obsessive passion which predicted greater levels of distress, coping responses, and negative attitudes toward the suspension.

111,Face masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness,"Face masks became the symbol of the global fight against the coronavirus. While face masks’ medical benefits are clear, little is known about their psychological consequences. Drawing on theories of the social functions of emotions and rapid trait impressions, we tested hypotheses on face masks’ effects on emotion-recognition accuracy and social judgments (perceived trustworthiness, likability, and closeness). Our preregistered study with 191 German adults revealed that face masks diminish people’s ability to accurately categorize an emotion expression and make target persons appear less close. Exploratory analyses further revealed that face masks buffered the negative effect of negative (vs. non-negative) emotion expressions on perceptions of trustworthiness, likability, and closeness. Associating face masks with the coronavirus’ dangers predicted higher perceptions of closeness for masked but not for unmasked faces. By highlighting face masks’ effects on social functioning, our findings inform policymaking and point at contexts where alternatives to face masks are needed.",Felix Grundmann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46038-88F-4D0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46038-88F-4D0,2020-10-09,2021-01-05T16:32:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social judgments; coronavirus; face masks; emotion perception; perceived closeness,False
112,State-level Stay-at-home Orders and Objectively Measured Movement in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19. State-wide stay-at-home orders received a large degree of attention as a public health intervention to increase social distancing, but relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the extent to which stay-at-home orders affected people’s behavior. Method: This study used GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. Results: From the first week of March to the first week of April, people in counties within states that enacted stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states that did not enact state-level stay-at-home orders. From the first week of April to the first week of May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place. The magnitude of change in movement associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total change in movement across all counties over the same periods of time in both cases. Conclusions: Stay-at-home orders are likely insufficient to reduce people’s movement outside the home without additional public health actions. Existing research on behavior change would be useful to determine what additional interventions could support social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic if becomes necessary to reduce movement in the future.",Kyle J.

It provided a unique opportunity to examine how external circumstances impact two crucial aspects of functioning relating to “who I am” (values) and “how I feel” (well-being). Participants (N = 150) reported their values, subjective and eduaimonic well-being nine months before lockdown in Poland, two weeks and four weeks into lockdown. We observed significant changes in values: an increase in self-direction, achievement, security, conformity, humility, benevolence and universalism, and a decrease in hedonism. All well-being indices showed a decrease in well-being with one specific difference between men and women: women experienced a more significant increase of negative affect compared to men. Finally, we showed that Openness to change values predict lower negative affect and higher eudaimonic well-being two weeks into lockdown. This study is unique in that it shows, that well-being and individually held values are flexible and adaptive systems that react to external circumstances, such as global critical events.",Agnieszka Bojanowska et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-B23-4B7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-B23-4B7,2020-07-23,2021-01-05T11:05:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False

In two studies we examined the link between imagination, anxiety, and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. US college students (N = 101, Study 1) and participants from an international community sample (N = 61, Study 2) were tested around the time that rates of COVID-19 cases were escalating. Across both samples, we found that spending more time in one’s imagination was associated with elevated levels of anxiety. Furthermore, frequency of imagination interacted with loneliness in predicting changes in anxiety during, compared to before the pandemic. Specifically, lonely people who spent more time imagining experienced the largest increases in anxiety during, compared to before the pandemic. In Study 1 valence of imagination and changes in anxiety were also moderated by feelings of loneliness, although this effect was not replicated in Study 2.

We examined how amount and type of social interactions and social media use would predict wellbeing during a period of physical distancing in the United Kingdom. In a 30-day diary study conducted in April-June 2020, 108 participants reported their daily social interactions and social media use, as well as their end-of-day wellbeing. Using multilevel regressions, we found that more face-to-face interactions positively predicted wellbeing, while technology-mediated communication had less consistent positive effects on wellbeing. More active and less passive social media use was associated with greater wellbeing. Our results suggest that while technology-mediated communication can improve wellbeing, face-to-face interactions are unique and important for wellbeing during physical distancing.",Rui Sun et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-55F-912,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-55F-912,2020-12-30,2021-01-03T16:21:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; social media; physical distancing; wellbeing; social interactions,False
118,"Stress, anxiety, depression and burnout in frontline health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic: a brief systematic review and new data from Russia","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) have been subject to increased workload while also exposed to many psychosocial stressors. In a systematic review we analyze the impact that the pandemic has had on HCWs mental state and associated risk factors. Most studies reported high levels of depression and anxiety among HCWs worldwide, however, due to a wide range of assessment tools, cut-off scores, and number of frontline participants in the studies, results were difficult to compare. Our study is based on two online surveys of 2195 HCWs from different regions of Russia during spring and autumn epidemic outbreaks revealed the rates of anxiety, stress, depression, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and perceived stress as 32.3%, 31.1%, 45.5%, 74.2%, 37.7% ,67.8%, respectively. Moreover, 2.4% of HCWs reported suicidal thoughts. The most common risk factors include: female gender, nurse as an occupation, younger age, working for over 6 months, chronic diseases, smoking, high working demands, lack of personal protective equipment, low salary, lack of social support, isolation from families, the fear of relatives getting infected. These results demonstrate the need for urgent supportive programs for HCWs fighting COVID-19 that fall into higher risk factors groups.",Ekaterina Mosolova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-990-0D6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-990-0D6,2021-01-02,2021-01-02T20:22:15+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; suicide; health care workers; covid-19; burnout; anxiety; stress; depression,False
119,Impact of a Single School-Based Intervention for COVID-19 on Improving Mental Health,"An underlying concern about the COVID-19 pandemic is that the mental health of children will decline. The present study aimed to investigate whether a single school-based intervention, including self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19, effectively achieved its aim to promote children’s mental health. The study was conducted in a junior high school. We assigned the third grade as the intervention group, second grade as the announcement group, and first grade, the control group. We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience improved mental health and reduced fear of COVID-19, when compared to the announcement and control groups. Interaction effects were observed only for depression, indicating a significant intervention effect in the intervention group. These findings suggest that a single school-based intervention that includes self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19 can help to improve children’s mental health. It is suggested that school-based interventions that intend to raise children's awareness of COVID-19 promote healthy development and adaptation within the school.",Takahiro Kubo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-657-288,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-657-288,2020-12-31,2021-01-02T20:21:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention,False
120,Pregnancy during the pandemic: The impact of COVID-19-related stress on risk for prenatal depression,"Pregnant women may be particularly sensitive to negative events (i.e., adversity) related to the COVID-19 pandemic and affective responses to these events (i.e., stress). We examined COVID-19-related stress and adversity in a sample of 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March-May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses in California that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk factors. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic had substantially elevated depressive symptoms compared to matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Several individual- and community-level risk and protective factors were associated with women’s scores on two latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity.

121,Mechanisms of Parental Stress During and After the COVID-19 Lockdown: A two-wave longitudinal study,"Background: In the unpredictable times of the ongoing global coronavirus disease (COVID-19), parents worldwide are affected by stressors and strains that follow in the wake of the government-initiated distancing protocols. Objective: In a two‐wave longitudinal survey, we examined levels of parental perceived stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression among a sample of parents at two time points; in the midst of the strictest government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2868) and three months after the protocols discontinued (T2, n = 1489). Further, we investigated the levels of parental stress, anxiety, and depression relative to perceived relationship quality and anger aimed at child(ren) at the two time points, including subgroups based on age, sex, cultural background, civil status, education level, number of children in household, employment status, and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Methods and findings: Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement occasions. As expected, the findings indicate that the high levels of parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stressors that parent’s experiences during distancing protocols declined as a function of the phaseout of the protocols. The decrease of perceived parental stress at the two time points, was accompanied by a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-off for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% respectively at T2. Reduction in depression and angry at child(ren) from T1 to T2 were further associated with a reduction in perceived parental stress. In addition, relationship quality and angry at child(ren) at T1 predicted change in parental stress. Conclusions: The findings underline some of the negative psychological impact of physical distancing protocols on parent’s health and well-being. Parents who are facing physical distancing and remaining at home with their children may be particularly vulnerable to parental stress, anxiety and depression. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated to parents and families facing social crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, can contribute to design relevant interventions to reduce parental stress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.

122,Development of an intervention to increase adherence to nebuliser treatment in adults with Cystic Fibrosis: CFHealthHub,"Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition in which daily therapies to maintain lung health are critical yet treatment adherence is low. Previous interventions to increase adherence have been largely unsuccessful and this is likely due to a lack of focus on behavioural evidence and theory alongside input from people with CF. This intervention is based on a digital platform that collects and displays objective nebuliser adherence data. The purpose of this paper is to identify the specific components of an intervention to increase and maintain adherence to nebuliser treatments in adults with CF with a focus on reducing effort and treatment burden. Methods Intervention development was informed by the behaviour change wheel (BCW) and Person-Based Approach (PBA). A multidisciplinary team conducted qualitative research to inform a needs analysis, selected and refined intervention components and methods of delivery, mapped adherence-related barriers and facilitators, associated intervention functions, and behaviour change techniques, and utilised iterative feedback to develop and refine content and processes. Results Results indicated that people with CF need to understand their treatment, be able to monitor adherence, have treatment goals and feedback, confidence in their ability to adhere, to have a treatment plan to develop habits for treatment, and be able to solve problems around treatment adherence. Behaviour change techniques were selected to address each of these needs and were incorporated into the digital intervention developed iteratively, alongside a manual and training for health professionals. Feedback from people with CF and clinicians helped to refine the intervention which could be tailored to individual patient needs. Conclusions The intervention development process is underpinned by a strong theoretical framework and evidence base and was developed by a multidisciplinary team with a range of skills and expertise integrated with substantial input from patients and clinicians. This multifaceted development strategy has ensured that the intervention is usable and acceptable to people with CF and clinicians, providing the best chance of success in supporting people with CF with different needs to increase and maintain their adherence.

123,A Path from Collective Threat to Eudaimonia: Mediating Role of Awe,"How do people react to collective threats such as natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic? Magnificent catastrophic events might have an impact on emotions of not only those who experienced direct harm from it but also those who feel threat without actual harm. The current study demonstrated that such threat enhances self-transcendent values that further leads to general well-being, mediated by the emotion of awe. Two surveys were conducted immediately after a severe typhoon hit Japan (Study 1) and during the early phases of the COVID-19 spread in Japan (Study 2). Predisposition to feel negative awe predicted participants’ attention to both collective threat events, which led to an affirmation of self-transcendent values and general well-being. Furthermore, when participants were asked to recall a collective threat (vs. control event), they felt more awe which led to more engaged meaning making during the event, in turn predicting their affirmation of self-transcendent values.",Masataka Nakayama et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-68A-58A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-68A-58A,2020-12-26,2021-01-02T19:46:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; eudaimonia; self-transcendence; awe; collective threat; well-being,False
124,Disassociating conformity driven and self-interest driven dishonest behaviors,"Dishonest behavior can be driven by both self-interest and social learning towards the external environment. However, whether and how these two processes (conformity-driven and self-interest-driven dishonesty) relate and interact to influence dishonest acts remains unknown. In the current research, we propose a computational model consisting of these two dishonesty processes. The results of the agent-based simulation modeling and experimental studies revealed that self-interest driven-dishonesty propensity determined the extent of dishonesty when one was in pursuit of self-interests, while the effect of dishonesty conformity on dishonesty was dependent on both the self and environmental dishonesty propensity. In addition, self-interest-driven dishonesty propensity was related to individuals’ preference for value allocation, while dishonesty conformity was related to the belief in environmental predictability. In cross-cultural contexts, these two processes of dishonesty exert distinct effects on participants’ tendency to violate the regulation rules of the local government and impacted the development of the local prevalence of pathogens during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of the current in-depth research validate the processes of conformity-driven and self-interest-driven dishonesty when dishonest behaviors emerged and to uncover how these two processes influenced the progression of a real-life emergent event.",Nora Huang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605C-261-866,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605C-261-866,2020-12-24,2021-01-02T19:44:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence,False
125,Monthly prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico,"Abstract Objective: Estimate the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from April to June 2020. Methods: Repeated cross-sections design based in the ENCOVID-19 – a series of monthly mobile surveys with representative samples of Mexico (N= 833- 1,674). The questionnaire includes the GAD-2 scale, and, in July, the GAD-7 scale was added; we examined its internal validity with confirmatory factor analysis and its concurrent validity with sociodemographic variables. Using GAD-7 as criterion, we analyzed the predictive validity of the GAD-2. We estimated the monthly prevalence with the GAD-2. Results: The GAD-7 and the GAD-2 are reliable and valid. The GAD-2 has a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.90. The monthly prevalence remains high and stable, between 30.7 and 32.6%. GAD concentrated in women, unemployed and persons with low socioeconomic status. Conclusions: GAD is a public health problem that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

127,What drives beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories? The role of psychotic-like experiences and confinement-related factors,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide threat to public health and the global economy. The climate of fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic has fostered the emergence of a wide-range of COVID-19 conspiracy theories that has the potential do shape public opinion and hinder the effective dissemination of valid information. Beliefs in conspiracy theories has been associated with maladaptive personality traits such as schizotypy and paranoia, as well as other non-psychotic psychological characteristics (e.g., social isolation, stress). The current study aimed to examine the association between beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and psychotic-like experiences within the community, while also addressing the role of sociodemographic information, psychological outcomes (e.g., stress, affective states) and other pandemic-related factors (e.g., confinement conditions/behaviors). Our results suggest that psychotic-like experiences are associated with beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, particularly perceptual abnormalities and persecutory ideation. Moreover, increased health-related concerns and reduced education levels also seem to be liability factors for these conspiracy beliefs. These results add important insights into how the adherence to illogical and erroneous disease-related arguments may be contingent to proneness to psychotic-like experiences.

128,Statistical Significance Filtering Overestimates Effects and Impedes Falsification: A Critique of Endsley (2019),"Whether in meta-analysis or single experiments, selecting results based on statistical significance leads to overestimated effect sizes, impeding falsification. We critique a quantitative synthesis that used significance to score and select previously published effects for situation awareness-performance associations (Endsley, 2019). How much does selection using statistical significance quantitatively impact results in a meta-analytic context? We evaluate and compare results using significance-filtered effects versus analyses with all effects as-reported. Endsley reported high predictiveness scores and large positive mean correlations but used atypical methods: the hypothesis was used to select papers and effects. Papers were assigned the maximum predictiveness scores if they contained at-least-one significant effect, yet most papers reported multiple effects, and the number of non-significant effects did not impact the score. Thus, the predictiveness score was rarely less than the maximum. In addition, only significant effects were included in Endsley’s quantitative synthesis. Filtering excluded half of all reported effects, with guaranteed minimum effect sizes based on sample size. Results for filtered compared to as-reported effects clearly diverged. Compared to the mean of as-reported effects, the filtered mean was overestimated by 56%. Furthermore, 92% (or 222 out of 241) of the as-reported effects were below the mean of filtered effects. We conclude that outcome-dependent selection of effects is circular, predetermining results and running contrary to the purpose of meta-analysis. Instead of using significance to score and filter effects, meta-analyses should follow established research practices.",Jonathan Z Bakdash et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-6A0-148,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-6A0-148,2020-09-25,2020-12-31T15:05:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; psychology; validity; human factors; meta-analysis; cognitive psychology; confirmation bias; significance filter; situation awareness; p-hacking; falsification; experimental psychology; selection bias; performance; inference,False
129,"A Cognitive Coping Model of Reinforcement Sensitivity, Emotion Regulation, and Affective Psychopathology: Cross-sectional, Longitudinal and Quasi-Experimental Evidence","Temperamental reinforcement sensitivity predicts affective pathology, with BAS sensitivity negatively predicting depression and BIS sensitivity positively predicting both depression and anxiety. Most clinical research on reinforcement sensitivity, however, neglects the role of cognitive mechanisms in mediating these relationships. The current article presents a cognitive coping model of clinical reinforcement sensitivity wherein the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity and affective pathology is mediated by trait preferences for corollary emotion regulation strategies. In Study 1, participants (N = 593) completed measures of reinforcement sensitivity, positive reappraisal, rumination, depression, and anxiety. Exploratory structural equation modeling found that the only model with a good fit included BAS sensitivity predicting reappraisal and BIS sensitivity negatively predicting it. Reappraisal then negatively predicted depression. BIS sensitivity also predicted rumination, which predicted both depression and anxiety. Study 2a confirmed the model developed in Study 1 with an independent sample (N = 513). It then examined longitudinal relationships with a second assessment 6 months later. The relationship from BIS sensitivity to rumination to depression and anxiety remained significant, as did the relationship between reappraisal and depression. Reinforcement sensitivity, however, did not predict reappraisal. In Study 2b, participants (N = 219) were assessed a third time one year later, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this stressful time, BAS sensitivity did longitudinally predict reappraisal.

130,Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions,"The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their child’s schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.",Lisa B Thorell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D6-4ED-930,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D6-4ED-930,2020-09-25,2020-12-30T11:08:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; mental health problems; covid-19; homeschooling; psychosocial effects,False
131,Propensity to reappraise promotes resilience to stress-induced negativity bias,"Stress exposure is associated with an increased tendency to appraise ambiguous social stimuli as negative. However, it remains unknown whether tendencies to use emotion regulation strategies—such as cognitive reappraisal, which involves altering the meaning of affective stimuli—can buffer these stress effects on social evaluations. Here, we examined whether increased reappraisal use confers resilience against stress-induced negativity bias. In Study 1, healthy participants (n=43) rated the valence of emotionally ambiguous (surprised) faces before and after an acute stress or control manipulation and reported reappraisal habits. Increased negativity ratings were milder for stressed individuals that reported more habitual reappraisal use. In Study 2 (n=97), we extended this investigation to real-world perceived stress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that reappraisal tendency moderates the relationship between perceived stress and increased negativity bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that the propensity to reappraise attenuates stress-induced negativity bias when evaluating others under uncertainty.",Candace Raio et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C0-163-89B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C0-163-89B,2020-12-28,2020-12-29T08:57:05+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other",False

133,Nine Months in the Life of a College Student During 2020: A Case Study Using Multi-Modal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of Well-being,"Emerging adulthood is a period marked by tremendous growth and opportunity, but also of significant risk. It is during this phase that the majority of major disease processes have their onset and also the time during which individuals develop habits for adaptive ways of managing stress and help-seeking when necessary. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of estimating stress levels through monitoring of physiological signs of sympathetic nervous system activity (e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, galvanic skin response, etc.) using wearable devices. However, this method of objective monitoring only captures changes in internal states but not the contextual factors – such as mental activity and social interactions – that are critical for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental health problems that may follow from the long-term effects of stress. Thus, there is a fundamental need to capture higher-level life events and contextual information to enable root cause analysis for treatment and prevention. The proposed case study is part of a larger pilot study in which we intensely follow a small sample of college students over the course of 9-months during an historic and tumultuous year in which COVID-19 disrupted daily living to understand contextual factors relevant to their mental health while capturing mood, sleep, physical activity, and physiology.

135,"Receipt, spending, and clinical correlates of economic impact payments among middle and low-income U.S. adults","This study examined characteristics and planned expenses of U.S. adults who received the economic impact payment (EIP) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using a nationally representative sample of 6,607 low and middle-income U.S. adults, this study examined the proportion and correlates of EIP receipt among eligible adults; and associations between planned expenses using the EIP, problems paying expenses, and clinical characteristics. In the total sample, 79% reported they received the EIP and 82% of recipients reported the EIP had a positive impact on their life. Being a veteran (OR= 2.59), married (OR= 1.82), with a history of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (OR= 1.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR= 1.51), and screening negative for recent suicidal ideation (OR= 0.49) were associated with EIP receipt. Planned expenses using the EIP for savings, paying debt, and rent accounted for 63% of the total amount. Greater planned expenses on substance use or gambling were correlated with lower rated impact of the EIP on life. Additionally, EIP receipt was associated with fewer problems paying daily expenses, but participants who screened positive for mental health or alcohol use problems were more likely to report problems paying daily expenses in the past month. Together, these findings suggest unconditional cash transfers, like the EIP, are important for low and middle-income populations to sustain their living situation. The management of funds are important to consider, especially among those experiencing mental health problems, and may represent opportunities for financial literacy and money management interventions.",Jack Tsai et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46171-D18-0CB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46171-D18-0CB,2020-12-28,2020-12-28T04:00:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental illness; economic impact payment; stimulus; coronavirus,False
136,"Change in mental and physical health, and social relationships, during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Australia","In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020. Our survey (n = 1599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Therefore, the psychological toll on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater COVID-19 infection rates. Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (~68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.",Shane L.

We assessed which of many leisure activities had positive psychological effects, with particular attention to music, which has been reported anecdotally to be important. Questionnaire data from over a thousand individuals primarily from Italy, Spain, and the USA during spring 2020 show that people picked music most often as the best activity to cope with psychological distress. Hours of engagement in music and food-related activities during the pandemic were associated with decreased depression symptoms. The benefits of music were mediated by individual differences in sensitivity to reward, whereas the positive effects of food-related activities were related to emotion regulation. Our results demonstrate that music is an important means of improving well-being, and suggest that the underlying mechanism is related to reward, consistent with neuroscience findings.

Without a vaccine or effective medication, the best hope for mitigating virus transmission is collective behavior change and support for public health interventions (e.g., physical distancing, physical hygiene, and endorsement of health policies). In a large-scale international collaboration (N = 46,450 across 67 countries), we investigated why people adopted public health behaviors and endorsed public policy interventions (e.g., closing bars and restaurants) during the early stages of the pandemic (April-May, 2020). Results revealed that respondents who identified more strongly with their nation consistently reported engagement in public health behaviors and greater support for public health policies. We also found a small effect of political orientation, indicating that left-wing respondents were more likely to report public health behaviors and support for public health measures than right-wing respondents.

In my dissertation “Coordination dynamics of crew rowing” I conducted various studies to investigate rowers’ ability to coordinate their movements, both in traditional synchronised (in-phase) and the more innovative antiphase rowing, during which the rowers alternate their strokes (Cuijpers, 2019). To be able to measure crew coordination and the movements of the boat on-water, I developed a measurement system using open-source computer hardware and software that allows building digital devices and interactive objects. The aim of this method paper is to provide insight in how this measurement system was developed and build.

140,Pandemic panic? Results of a 6-month longitudinal study on fear of COVID-19,"Fear is an evolutionary adaptive emotion that serves to protect the organism from harm. Once a threat diminishes, fear should also dissipate as otherwise fear may become chronic and pathological. While threat (i.e., number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has substantially varied over time, it remains unclear whether fear has followed a similar pattern. To examine the development of fear of COVID-19 and investigate potential predictors for chronic fear, we conducted a large online longitudinal study (N = 2000) using the Prolific platform. Participants represented unselected residents of 34 different countries. The Fear of the Coronavirus Questionnaire (FCQ) and several other demographic and psychological measures were completed monthly between March and August 2020. Overall, we find that fear steadily decreased after a peak in April 2020.

141,Perceived risk factors for severe Covid-19 symptoms and their association with health behaviours: Findings from the HEBECO study,"Background: There remains uncertainty about Covid-19 risk factors. We examined UK adults’ risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 symptoms and whether engaging in concurrent health behaviours is associated with risk perceptions. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the HEBECO study where 2206 UK adults classified potential factors (age 70+, ethnic minority, medical comorbidities, vaping, smoking cigarettes, alcohol drinking, regular physical activity, being overweight, eating unhealthy foods, using nicotine replacement therapy – NRT, lower income, poor housing, being a keyworker) as either increasing, decreasing, or having no impact on severe Covid-19 symptoms. Logistic regressions examined whether engaging in health behaviours was associated with risk perceptions after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, health conditions and other behaviours. Results: The great majority (89-99%) of adults classified age 70+, having comorbidities, being a key worker, overweight, and from an ethnic minority as increasing the risk. People were less sure about alcohol drinking, vaping, and nicotine replacement therapy use (17.4-29.5% responding ‘don’t know’). Relative to those who did not, those who smoked tobacco, vaped and consumed alcohol had significantly (all p<0.015) higher odds (aORs=1.58 to 5.80) for classifying these behaviours as ‘no impact’ or ‘decreasing risk’, and lower odds (aORs=.25 to .72) for classifying as ‘increasing risk’. Similarly, eating more fruit and vegetables was associated with classifying unhealthy diet as ‘increasing risk’ (aOR=1.37,1.12-1.69), and exercising more with classifying regular physical activity as ‘decreasing risk’ (aOR=2.42,1.75-3.34). Conclusions: Risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 symptoms were lower for adults’ own health behaviours, evidencing optimism bias. Implications: These risk perceptions may form barriers to changing one’s own unhealthy behaviours or make one less responsive to interventions that refer to the risk of Covid-19 as a motivating factor. Thus, in some cases risk perceptions could help sustain unhealthy behaviours and exacerbate inequalities in health behaviours and outcomes.",Aleksandra Herbec et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-5B7-F6C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-5B7-F6C,2020-12-20,2020-12-22T16:41:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; cross-sectional; health behaviours; covid-19; optimism bias; health behaviors; risk perceptions,False

Further, international states and organizations have claimed an increase in IPV numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising awareness of the potential causes and providing urgent recommendations and guidelines to follow for the containment and possible interventions. Based on these priorities, this review aims to explore and analyze the existing scientific literature on the association and consequences of COVID-19 on Domestic Violence and to sum up the strategies and recommendations for clinicians and health care workers. Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus and Science of Direct were searched. Papers published between 2019 and 2020, written in English and having as main focus the domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, were included. Results: At the final stage, 60 articles were included and analyzed. Results pointed three pre-determined categories: the course, the dynamics, the recommendations and an adjunctive category DV and disasters.

143,"The network structure of stress-related states, depression, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown","Background. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing protocols used to impede the spread of the virus may have severe mental health consequences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the network of components of pandemic-related negative psychological states (i.e., fear of infection, financial worries, loneliness) and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods. Data from 10,061 Norwegian adults recruited through an online survey during a period of strict social distancing protocols were analyzed employing a cross-sectional Gaussian Graphical Model. Results. Of the infection fears, fear of being infected, fear of dying from the coronavirus and fear of significant others dying from it had notable connections to the GAD symptoms anxiety and/or fear of awful events. The financial worry component worry about personal economy was connected to the MDD symptom sleep problems and to the GAD symptom generalized worry. Each of the loneliness components was connected to a specific MDD symptom. Anhedonia, depressed mood and worthlessness had the highest strength centrality among the MDD symptoms; generalized worry, uncontrollability of worry, and trouble relaxing among the GAD symptoms; fear of dying from the virus among the fear of infection components; and feeling isolated among the loneliness components. A community analysis identified separate clusters for MDD and GAD as well as a cluster cutting across the two disorders. Conclusions. Particular components of the pandemic-related distressing states of fear of infection and loneliness seem to be associated with specific symptoms of MDD and GAD.

144,Revisiting the role of financial motives in disordered gambling: A meta-analytic review,"Aims: Money is central to psychological definitions of gambling, but contemporary accounts of disordered gambling are ambiguous regarding the role of financial motives for gambling. The aims of the current research were to obtain meta-analytic weighted effect sizes for zero-order associations of financial motives against disordered gambling and gambling frequency, as well as partial associations after controlling for other motives (e.g. coping). Design: A meta-analysis of the available literature through October 2019 was undertaken. Studies were identified from multiple sources (e.g., database search, consulting other researchers). PRISMA standards were followed when screening identified records and extracting relevant data. The data analytic plan was pre-registered. Setting: Cross-sectional studies that involved student, community, and clinical samples of people who gamble. Participants: Forty-one studies were included with 32,997 participants from different countries. Measurements: Validated self-report measures of financial motives for gambling alongside measures of either problem gambling and/or gambling frequency. Findings: Financial motives for gambling were positively associated with both disordered gambling, r = .34, [.30, .38], p =1.04e-61, and gambling frequency, r = .29, [.20, .37], p = 1.70e-13, with moderate effect sizes. The partial associations after controlling for overlapping variance with other gambling motives were also positive (disordered gambling: β = .18, [.14, .23], p = 2.53e-15; gambling frequency: β = .16, [.08, .24], p = 9.45e-5), with small-to-moderate effect sizes. The effect sizes were heterogenous and the extent of heterogeneity was high. Moderator analyses of the zero-order association involving gambling frequency indicated that effect sizes were larger for studies that used the Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Financial relative to studies that developed their own gambling motives measure. No further moderators were statistically significant.

145,Optimizing COVID-19 Health Campaigns: A Person-Centered Approach,"As the United States continues to be ravaged by COVID-19, it becomes increasingly important to implement effective public health campaigns to improve personal behaviors that help control the spread of the virus. To design effective campaigns, research is needed to understand the current mitigation intentions of the general public, diversity in those intentions, and theoretical predictors of them. COVID-19 campaigns will be particularly challenging because mitigation involves myriad, diverse behaviors. This study takes a person-centered approach to investigate data from a survey (N = 976) of Pennsylvania adults. Latent class analysis revealed five classes of mitigation: one marked by complete adherence with health recommendations (34% of the sample), one by complete refusal (9% of the sample), and three by a mixture of adherence and refusal. Statistically significant covariates of class membership included relatively negative injunctive norms, risk due to essential workers in the household, personal knowledge of someone who became infected with COVID-19, and belief that COVID-19 was a leaked biological weapon. Additionally, trait reactance was associated with non-adherence while health mavenism was associated with adherence. These findings may be used to good effect by local healthcare providers and institutions, and also inform broader policy-making decisions regarding public health campaigns to mitigate COVID-19.",Rachel Smith et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-062-C6C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-062-C6C,2020-12-18,2020-12-22T16:06:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; injunctive norms; covid-19; audience analysis; risk; mitigation; latent class analysis,False
146,Different conspiracy theories have different psychological and social determinants: Comparison of three theories about the origins of the COVID-19 virus in a representative sample of the UK population,"Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 have proliferated during the global pandemic, and their rapid spread among certain groups in the population has important implications for policy attitudes (e.g., motivation to engage in social distancing and willingness to vaccinate). Using survey data from two waves of a nationally representative, longitudinal study of life in lockdown in the UK (N = 1,406), we analyze the factors associated with belief in three theories related to COVID-19, namely that it 1) originated in a meat market in Wuhan, China, 2) was developed in a lab in Wuhan, China, and 3) is caused by 5G mobile networks. Using a dual-factor model, we test how cognitive ability and motivations affect susceptibility to misinformation. Our findings suggest that motivational and political dispositions, as well as the sources from which people derive COVID-19 related information, are strongly associated with belief in conspiracy theories about the virus, though these predictors vary among conspiracies. Belief in the Chinese lab conspiracy is associated with right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and a preference for tabloid newspapers, while belief in the 5G network origin story is associated with social dominance orientation and a tendency to derive information on COVID-19 from social media. Moreover, we find that motivational factors like RWA and SDO have larger effect sizes than COVID-19 related anxiety, a desire for certainty, cognitive reasoning ability, or even general conspiracy ideation (in the case of 5G belief). These findings suggest that efforts to mitigate the potential damage caused by conspiracy theories, for example, by increasing education and awareness, may be inadequate because they miss a larger story, namely the role that politically motivated reasoning plays in making individuals susceptible to misinformation, and the propagation of conspiracies through networks and channels that reinforce these inaccurate worldviews.",Todd K.

147,Delay discounting and under-valuing of recent information predict lower adherence to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the day-to-day behaviours of populations globally, especially in areas where social distancing rules have been mandated. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying (un)successful behaviour change around social distancing is crucial to inform public health policy for both the current and future crises. In this study, we utilise tasks probing delay discounting (the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards) and patch foraging (evaluating the trade-off between exploiting a known resource and exploring an unknown one) to investigate cognitive predictors of social distancing and mental health symptoms. Participants (N=442) were recruited from a large UK cohort (N=2025) nationally representative in age, gender and income. Greater sensitivity to reward magnitude during delay discounting predicted lower adherence to social distancing measures and higher levels of mood and anxiety symptoms. In addition, under-valuing recently sampled information during foraging separately predicted greater violation of social distancing. Analyses examining cognitive factors underpinning social distancing behaviour across two time points (early and late phases of the pandemic) additionally revealed that greater sensitivity to magnitude of rewards on offer during delay discounting predicted a greater decline in psychological inclination to maintain social distancing. Moreover, under-valuing recent information during foraging separately predicted less motivation to engage in social distancing during the established phase of the pandemic. The findings suggest that those who typically regulate their mood through behaviours that bring about immediate reward are also those who struggle to maintain social distancing. Further, those who adapt more quickly to new information showed better ability to change their behaviour in response to public health measures. These findings highlight the need for public health initiatives that bolster sustained confidence in planning around social distancing by emphasising the immediate rewards to self as well as longer term benefits.",Alex Lloyd et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782,2020-09-22,2020-12-22T15:04:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; decision-making; coronavirus; patch; social distancing; covid-19; delay discounting; foraging,False
148,Fearing the Disease or the Vaccine: The Case of COVID-19,"Objective: As COVID-19 continues to spread, researchers are working to develop a safe and effective vaccine. The success of an approved vaccine in stopping or slowing the pandemic will ultimately depend on the public’s acceptance of it. As studies indicate that people perceive COVID-19 as a threatening disease, the demand for a vaccine could be expected to be high. However, vaccine safety concerns might still outweigh the perceived disease risks in a decision to vaccinate against COVID-19. In the present paper, the role of perceived risk of COVID-19 (i.e., perceived likelihood of infection, perceived disease severity, and disease-related worry) and trust in the safety of a prospective vaccine against COVID-19 in predicting intentions to accept a COVID-19 vaccine was investigated. Methods: Three Finnish samples were surveyed: 856 parents of small children, 205 individuals living in an area with suboptimal vaccination coverage, and 1,325 Facebook users nationwide. As points of reference, we compared the perceptions of COVID-19 to those of influenza and measles. Results: COVID-19 was perceived as a threatening disease—more so than influenza and measles. The strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intentions was trusting the safety of the potential vaccine. Those perceiving COVID-19 as a severe disease were also slightly more intent on taking a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: If a vaccine against COVID-19 is successfully developed, assuring the public that the vaccine is safe should be the focus for health authorities aiming to achieve a high vaccine uptake.",Linda C.

149,Harnessing shared identities to mobilise resilient responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Shared social identifications (family, community, nation, humanity) predict normative actions and psychological well-being, and can be invoked discursively by leaders to mobilise their followers. We illustrate the potential for harnessing shared identities to mobilise resilient public responses against COVID-19.

150,Paranoia and Belief Updating During a Crisis,"The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made the world seem unpredictable. During such crises we can experience concerns that others might be against us, culminating perhaps in paranoid conspiracy theories. Here, we investigate paranoia and belief updating in an online sample (N=1,010) in the United States of America (U.S.A). We demonstrate the pandemic increased individuals’ self-rated paranoia and rendered their task-based belief updating more erratic. Local lockdown and reopening policies, as well as culture more broadly, markedly influenced participants’ belief-updating: an early and sustained lockdown rendered people’s belief updating less capricious. Masks are clearly an effective public health measure against COVID-19. However, state-mandated mask wearing increased paranoia and induced more erratic behaviour. Remarkably, this was most evident in those states where adherence to mask wearing rules was poor but where rule following is typically more common. This paranoia may explain the lack of compliance with this simple and effective countermeasure. Computational analyses of participant behaviour suggested that people with higher paranoia expected the task to be more unstable, but at the same time predicted more rewards. In a follow-up study we found people who were more paranoid endorsed conspiracies about mask-wearing and potential vaccines – again, mask attitude and conspiratorial beliefs were associated with erratic task behaviour and changed priors. Future public health responses to the pandemic might leverage these observations, mollifying paranoia and increasing adherence by tempering people’s expectations of other’s behaviour, and the environment more broadly, and reinforcing compliance.",Praveen Suthaharan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46060-374-001,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46060-374-001,2020-09-04,2020-12-21T22:27:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning,False
151,Racial Inequity in Federal Grant Funding,"Circulation of videos showing the death of George Floyd, at the hands of police officers, in May of 2020 prompted renewed national conversations about systemic racism. Biomedical research in the USA, including that supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is not immune to the systemic racism that pervades American society. A groundbreaking analysis of NIH grant success revealed in 2011 that applications submitted by Black or African-American Principal Investigators (PIs) were less likely to be funded, compared with those submitted by white PIs. NIH efforts to respond have included attempts to attribute the effect to mediating variables other than PI race; attempts to fix the “pipeline” by funding more African-American trainees; and attempts to eliminate subconscious, or implicit, bias in peer reviewers. An updated report published in 2019 showed that nothing has changed and that topics of interest to African-Americans are less likely to be funded, even with white PIs. Here, we review the response of the NIH to these issues, which we argue are inadequate, and we issue a call to action for all participants in the tax-payer funded NIH system of research funding. It is unacceptable that NIH grant funding disparities based on the race of the PI continue to persist in the current system. It is unacceptable that health conditions and topics of interest to Black citizens are systematically overlooked for research funding. The NIH must create an actionable plan that permanently eliminates racial disparities in grant award.",Michael Taffe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DC-671-691,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DC-671-691,2020-12-10,2020-12-21T22:26:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Other Neuroscience and Neurobiology; grant funding; nih,False
152,"COVID-19 and Wellbeing: Demographics, Individual Differences, and Leadership Help Explain Pandemic Impact","Across the globe, COVID-19 continues to disrupt everyday lives, with serious consequences for individuals' health and wellbeing. This retrospective, multinational survey study draws upon the Personal Resource Allocation (PRA) framework to explore how various demographic factors, individual differences, and leadership determine the perceived and actual impact of COVID-19 on health (mental, physical) and wellbeing (work, home, general) across five countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Having dependents under 12, working more hours since the onset, and having essential worker status led to better wellbeing outcomes. All three individual differences (adaptivity, resilience, remote work training) were positively related to engagement, with resilience and remote work also relating to better health for these individuals. Lastly, perceptions of COVID impact on mental and physical health had negative consequences for general wellbeing, while effective leadership perceptions predicted work engagement. No differences were found between the five countries. Findings highlight the importance of personal resources in determining the pandemic’s impact on wellbeing.",Matthew J Grawitch et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46113-E62-3DC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46113-E62-3DC,2020-12-10,2020-12-21T22:26:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Leadership; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Quality; wellbeing; engagement; remote work training; resilience; adaptivity,False
153,Moral decision making in healthcare and medical professions during the COVID-19 pandemic,"With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, healthcare and medical professions face challenging situations. High number of infected patients, scarce resources, and being vulnerable to the infection are among the reasons that may influence clinicians’ decision making and puts them in a moral situation. Furthermore, they may be carriers of coronavirus, resulting their social interactions to involve moral decision making. The aim of this study was to examine the moral decision making in clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and to find its relation to psychological, cognitive, and behavioral correlates. 193 clinicians who worked in hospitals allocated to coronavirus disease patients, participated in our study. We designed an online survey containing 8 dilemmas to test moral decision making in clinicians. Information on clinicians’ behavior, cognition and psychological state during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the degree of respect to social distancing, sources of stress, and dead cases of COVID-19 they confronted with were collected. The relation between these measures and moral decision making was assessed. Based on our results, clinicians’ most important source of stress was the infection of their families. There was a positive correlation between utilitarian responses and clinicians’ stress level, and number of dead cases they confronted with. Moreover, degree of utilitarian behavior was positively correlated to social distancing. Both age and sex contributed to individual differences in respecting social distancing, stress and utilitarian behavior. With increasing stress and encountering more deaths, clinicians tended to decide based on the outcome. Our results have critical implications in implementing policies for healthcare principals.",Hamed Borhany et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-99F-01A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-99F-01A,2020-09-01,2020-12-21T22:26:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; front-line workers; moral decision making; healthcare and medical professions; covid-19; utilitarian behavior,False
154,Psychiatry and Covid-19: Acute mental health presentations before and during the pandemic,"Background We aimed to analyse numbers and types of psychiatric presentations to inform planning for future demand on mental health services in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods We analysed electronic data between January and April 2020 for 2,534 patients referred to acute psychiatric services. We used interrupted time series analyses to compare trends in A&E and psychiatric presentations before and after lockdown, and tested for differences in patients’ demographics, symptom severity, and use of the Mental Health Act, before and after lockdown. Results There were 11% fewer psychiatric presentations the first week and 64% fewer A&E presentations the first month after lockdown initiated. A higher proportion of patients were detained under the Mental Health Act (22.2% vs 16.1%) and Mental Capacity Act (2.2 vs 1.1%)(χ2(2)=16.3, p<0.0001) and they experienced a longer duration of symptoms before seeking help from mental health services (χ 2(3)= 18.6, p<0.0001). A higher proportion of patients presented with psychotic symptoms (23.3% v 17.0%) or delirium (7.0 v 3.6%) and fewer had parasuicidal behaviour (43.8% v 52.0, χ2 (7)= 28.7, p<0.0001). A higher proportion were admitted to psychiatric inpatient units (22.2% vs 18.3%) (χ 2(6)= 42.8, p<0.0001) after lockdown Conclusions UK lockdown resulted in fewer psychiatric presentations but those who presented were more likely to have severe symptoms, be detained under the Mental Health Act and admitted to hospital.

155,Supporting Families to Protect Child Health: Parenting Quality and Household Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic-linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent-child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.",Leslie E Roos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A,2020-09-04,2020-12-21T22:23:26+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; psychology; covid; maternal-child health; family; mental health; child development; depression,False
156,"Trajectories of eating behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of 22,374 adults in the UK","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of stay-at-home and lockdown measures. It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual’s eating behaviors. Objective: The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. Design: Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, heath-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. Results: Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR= 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR= 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR= 0.54-0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were most common amongst the consistently overeaters, whereas underweight participants persistently ate less. Conclusion: In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics.

157,Psychological and situational effects on social distancing and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: not a question of real risk,"Keeping a large interpersonal space (IPS) is one of the most important measures to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. The IPS is automatically modulated according to primary affiliation and defence needs aimed at protecting our physical and psychological well-being. Through a multicentric online survey (1293 respondents) in six Italian regions during the lockdown (April-May 2020), we investigated the psychological and situational factors that influenced the regulation of IPS and psychological well-being. The results showed that the IPS was modulated according to perceived rather than actual risk of COVID-19 infection. This perception was influenced by institutional communication and citizen satisfaction in local Healthcare Systems. Higher levels of anxiety, stress and feeling of insecurity, exacerbated by situational factors linked to the context of life, led to an increase in IPS at the expense of psychological well-being. Instead, the possibility to go out and seeing other people wearing a face-mask reduced the IPS.

158,Association of coping strategies with mental health trajectories during the first twenty-one weeks of COVID-19 lockdown,"The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is well evidenced. However, there is little research on how individuals’ coping strategies during the pandemic were related to changes in mental health over time. The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study (N=26,505) to explore whether particular coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery from symptoms across 21 weeks. People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress.",Meg Fluharty et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-A63-3CF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-A63-3CF,2020-11-10,2020-12-21T22:16:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; longitudinal; depression; mental health; coping; covid-19; anxiety,False
159,Early Indicators of COVID-19 Infection Prevention Behaviors: Machine Learning Identifies Personal and Country-Level Factors,"The Coronavirus is highly infectious and potentially deadly. In the absence of a cure or a vaccine, the infection prevention behaviors recommended by the World Health Organization constitute the only measure that is presently available to combat the pandemic. The unprecedented impact of this pandemic calls for swift identification of factors most important for predicting infection prevention behavior. In this paper, we used a machine learning approach to assess the relative importance of potential indicators of personal infection prevention behavior in a global psychological survey we conducted between March-May 2020 (N = 56,072 across 28 countries). The survey data were enriched with society-level variables relevant to the pandemic. Results indicated that the two most important indicators of self-reported infection prevention behavior were individual-level injunctive norms—beliefs that people in the community should engage in social distancing and self-isolation, followed by endorsement of restrictive containment measures (e.g., mandatory vaccination). Society-level factors (e.g., national healthcare infrastructure, confirmed infections) also emerged as important indicators. Social attitudes and norms were more important than personal factors considered most important by theories of health behavior. The model accounted for 52% of the variance in infection prevention behavior in a separate test sample—above the performance of psychological models of health behavior. These results suggest that individuals are intuitively aware that this pandemic constitutes a social dilemma situation, where their own infection risk is partly dependent on the behaviors of others. If everybody engaged in infection prevention behavior, the virus could be defeated even without a vaccine.",Caspar J.

160,Social Distancing in America: Understanding Long-term Adherence to Covid-19 Mitigation Recommendations,"A crucial question in the governance of infectious disease outbreaks is how to ensure that people continue to adhere to mitigation measures for the longer duration of the pandemic. The present paper examines this question by means of a nationally representative cross-sectional set of studies conducted in the United States in May, June, and July 2020. It seeks to understand to what extent Americans continued to adhere to social distancing measures in the period after the first lockdown ended during the first wave of COVID-19. Moreover, it seeks to uncover which situational and motivational variables sustained (or undermined) adherence. Our findings reveal a mix of situational and motivational variables that contributed to adherence in the period after the first lockdown: individuals’ knowledge of social distancing measures, their practical capacity to adhere to them, their opportunities for not doing so, and their impulsivity (situational influences), as well as their moral alignment with mitigation measures against the virus, perceptions of its health threat, and perceived norms for adherence in their community (motivational influences). The results also reveal, however, that adherence among Americans declined during this period, as did important situational and motivational processes that sustained this. The findings show that adherence does not just originate in motivations and that situational variables play a central role. Moreover, they show that adherence is dynamic, as the core variables that sustain can change over a short period of time. These insights help to advance understanding of pandemic governance, as well as illuminating the interaction between rules and human conduct and compliance more generally. Moreover, they identify important avenues for policy to promote and sustain adherence to mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future outbreaks.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620F-583-148,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620F-583-148,2020-10-07,2020-12-21T17:08:57+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; public health behaviors; pandemic compliance; trust in science; united states of america; capacity; covid-19; political orientation; emotions; threat perceptions; george floyd; opportunity; trust in media; social distancing; health behaviors; social norms; compliance; obligation to obey the law; black lives matter; procedural justice; deterrence; partisanship; public health; impulsivity; adherence",False
161,Is it riskier to meet 100 people outdoors or 14 people indoors? Comparing public and expert perceptions of COVID-19 risk,"How do people perceive and integrate multiple contextual risk factors for COVID-19 infection? We elicited risk perceptions from a nationally representative sample of the public (N = 800) using three psychologically-distinct tasks. Responses were compared to a sample of medical experts who completed the same tasks. The public underestimated the risk associated with environmental factors (such as whether a gathering takes place indoors or outdoors) and the implications when multiple risk factors are present. Our results are consistent with a heuristic simply to ‘avoid people’ and with a coarse (e.g. ‘safe or unsafe’) classification of social settings. A further task, completed only by the general public sample, generated novel evidence that when the risk of infection competes against a risk in another domain (e.g. a different medical risk), people perceive a lower likelihood of contracting the virus.

162,Interest consistency can buffer the effect of COVID-19 fear on psychological distress,"In the context of a recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the present study investigated the buffering effect of grit on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress. The data were collected from 224 Japanese participants (98 females; mean age = 46.56, SD = 13.41) in July 2020. The measures used in this study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Short Grit Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS). The results of mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of consistency of interest, a major component of grit, on psychological distress; we also found non-significant indirect effects of perseverance of effort, another major component of grit, on psychological distress. These results suggest that consistency of interest buffers the psychological distress induced by fear of COVID-19. Based on these results, it can be concluded that individuals with higher consistency of interest are less likely to experience worsening of their mental health, even if they experience fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic.",Akihiro Masuyama et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-225-D76,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-225-D76,2020-12-21,2020-12-21T08:16:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; depression; covid-19; grit; pandemic; anixety,False
163,False-positive Effect in the Radin Double-slit Experiment: HARKing is used by Radin et al. to Misrepresent the Advanced Meta-experimental Protocol used in Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019),"A general commentary by Walleczek and von Stillfried (2020) was recently published in Frontiers in Psychology. The present work provides an account of (i) the detailed research record and (ii) the main arguments behind the commentary for the purpose of full transparency and disclosure. For historical overview, Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019) had previously reported (i) the absence of any true-positive effects and (ii) the presence of one false-positive effect in a commissioned replication study of the Radin double-slit (DS) experiment on observer consciousness. In their subsequent misrepresentations, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) regrettably used the malpractice of undisclosed HARKing, i.e., undisclosed hypothesizing after the results are known. HARKing can increase greatly the risk of false-negative or false-positive conclusions. Specifically, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) deviated in two major ways from the pre-specified protocol for this commissioned study, which (i) was agreed to by Radin before data collection was started (Radin, 2011) and (ii) included data encryption to prevent the use of p-hacking and HARKing. First, Radin et al. (2019) violate the original research design by reporting a so-called “true-positive outcome of a secondary planned hypothesis”. Contrary to the claim by Radin et al. (2019, 2020), that hypothesis was not, however, part of the planned test strategy, but, instead, the associated statistical analysis – a chi-square test – was chosen by Radin sometime after the planned statistical analysis had been completed and the data unblinded. Second, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) violate the funder-approved research design in an additional way by falsely claiming that the newly developed protocol, i.e., the advanced meta-experimental protocol (AMP), implements a non-predictive test strategy when – in fact – the AMP-based test strategy is strictly predictive. Put simply, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) are mistaken that the funder-approved hypotheses posited the random occurrence of effects for the test categories in this replication experiment; instead, a different specific prediction was tested in each of the eight planned test categories, and true-positive effects were predicted to occur for only two (12.5%) of the 16 possible measurement outcomes of the eight planned single-test categories. Therefore, in the predictive single-testing regime, a statistical correction for non-predictive, i.e., random, multiple testing would not be appropriate and would thus violate the AMP-based strategy, which was implemented in the commissioned study based upon the planned outcome predictions as pre-specified in Radin (2011). Neither of these post-hoc changes by Radin et al. (on the basis of HARKing) were disclosed in Radin et al. (2019, 2020) and both these changes violate the funder-approved, original methodology agreed upon in Radin (2011) and pre-specified in the research contract. In summary, the present work reconfirms that – exactly as reported in Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019) – “the false-positive effect, which would be indistinguishable from the predicted true-positive effect, was significant at p = 0.021 (σ = −2.02; N = 1,250 test trials)” and “no statistically significant effects could be identified” in those two groups for which true-positives were predicted to occur. These observations are consistent also with an independent statistical reanalysis of the Radin DS-experiment by Tremblay (2019) and a replication attempt by Guerrer (2019). Tremblay reported significant false-positives in control groups and Guerrer found significant effects with post-hoc analyses only, but null results only when using the planned confirmatory analysis. As a general recommendation, the authors call for the implementation of advanced control-test strategies, including novel approaches from the metascience reform movement, for empirically detecting and preventing uncontrolled false-positive effects in parapsychological research.",Jan Walleczek et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-9EB-7DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-9EB-7DD,2020-07-29,2020-12-21T07:31:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; advanced meta-experimental protocol; confirmatory analysis; counterfactual meta-experimentation; radin double-slit experiment; harking; metascience reform movement,False
164,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.",Michelle N.

165,Psychological distance towards COVID-19: Geographical and hypothetical distance predict attitudes and mediate knowledge,"Objectives: We applied the concept of psychological distance to understand the perceived affection by COVID-19 and investigated its connection with protective behaviour (RQ1), context-specific antecedents (RQ2), and its possibility to mediate the effect of knowledge on attitudes (RQ3). Design: We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional study (N = 395, Mage = 32.2 years, SDage = 13.9 years, 64.3% female) in Germany in July 2020, a time with a low incidence of people infected with Sars-CoV2. Methods: People completed online questionnaires about socio-psychological constructs addressing COVID-19, further information was included from external sources. Results: Geographical distance only predicted cognitive attitudes towards COVID-19 (β = -0.25, p < 0.001), hypothetical distance (i.e. feeling to be likely affected by COVID-19) predicted participants’ affective, cognitive, and behavioural attitudes (-0.16 < β < -0.28) and the installation of a warning-app (β = -0.18, p < 0.01). Geographical distance to COVID-19 was predicted by living in cities and knowledge. Hypothetical distance was affected by Sars-CoV2 cases in social surrounding, knowledge, and level of education. Hypothetical and geographical distance mediated the effect of knowledge on attitudes. Conclusions: While geographical distance affected peoples’ cognitive evaluation of COVID-19, hypothetical distance predicted the evaluation and the implementation of protective behaviours. Since Sars-CoV2 affects spatial regions differently, there is a need for addressing the likelihood of infecting oneself with COVID-19, which may be an objective for formal and informal educational activities. However, the success of these activities depends on peoples’ geographical and hypothetical distance, given their mediating role between knowledge and attitudes.",Simon Blauza et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-763-AE1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-763-AE1,2020-12-16,2020-12-20T07:37:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior,False
166,Investigating the Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Assessment of Cognition: a Web-based Questionnaire Study,"We investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the modality of cognitive assessments (in-person versus remote assessments). We created a web-based questionnaire with 34 items and collected data from 114 respondents from a range of health care professions and settings. We established the proportion of cognitive assessments which were face-to-face or via video or telephone conferencing, both pre- and post-March 2020. Further, we asked respondents about the assessment tools used and perceived barriers, challenges and facilitators for the remote assessment of cognition. In addition, we asked questions specifically about the use of the Oxford Cognitive Screen. We found that the frequency of assessing cognition was stable compared to pre-pandemic levels. Use of telephone and video conferencing cognitive assessments increased by 10% and 18% respectively. Remote assessment increased accessibility to participants and safety but made observing the subtleties of behaviour during test administration difficult. The respondents called for an increase in the availability of standardised, validated, and normed remote assessments. We conclude that the pandemic has not been detrimental to the frequency of cognitive assessments. In addition, a shift in clinical practice to include remote cognitive assessments is clear and wider availability of validated and standardised remote assessments is necessary.",Sam Sappho Webb et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46027-E50-ED4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46027-E50-ED4,2020-12-18,2020-12-20T07:30:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; cognitive assessment; video conferencing; teleneuropsychology; remote assessment; telephone conferencing; cognition,False
167,Is the Myth of Left-Wing Authoritarianism Itself a Myth?,"Is left-wing authoritarianism (LWA) closer to a myth or a reality? Twelve studies test the empirical existence and theoretical relevance of LWA. Study 1 reveals that both conservative and liberal Americans identify a large number of left-wing authoritarians in their lives. In Study 2, participants explicitly rate items from a recently-developed LWA measure as valid measurements of authoritarianism. Studies 3-11 show that persons who score high on this same LWA scale possess the traits associated with models of authoritarianism (while controlling for political ideology): LWA is positively related to threat sensitivity across multiple areas, including general ecological threats (Study 3), COVID disease threat (Study 4), Belief in a Dangerous World (Study 5), and Trump threat (Study 6). Further, controlling for ideology, high-LWA persons show more support for restrictive political correctness norms (Study 7), rate African-Americans and Jews more negatively (Studies 8-9), and show more domain-specific dogmatism and attitude strength (Study 10). Study 11 reveals that the majority of the effects from Studies 3-10 hold when looking only within liberals, thus revealing these effects are about liberal authoritarianism. Study 12 uses the World Values Survey to provide evidence of Left-Wing Authoritarianism around the globe. Taken in total, this large array of triangulating evidence from 12 studies comprised of over 8,000 participants from the U.S. and over 66,000 participants world-wide strongly suggests that left-wing authoritarianism is much closer to a reality than a myth.",Lucian Gideon Conway Iii et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-516-F0B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-516-F0B,2020-12-18,2020-12-20T07:13:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; left-wing authoritarianism; ideological asymmetry; political psychology; ideology; right-wing authoritarianism,False
168,"Optimism, Mindfulness, and Resilience as Potential Protective Factors for the Mental Health Consequences of Fear of the Coronavirus","The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on mental health. Prior reports have shown that depression, anxiety, and stress have increased throughout the pandemic. Nonetheless, not everyone is affected by these negative consequences and some people may be relatively unaffected. In this online study in a predominantly Dutch and Belgian sample (N = 546), we investigated whether positive personality traits such as optimism, mindfulness, and resilience may protect against the negative mental health consequences (i.e., fear of the coronavirus, depression, stress, and anxiety) of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that fear of COVID-19 was related to higher depression, stress, and anxiety. However, for participants scoring high on mindfulness, optimism, and resilience, this relationship was weakened. In addition to these findings, we present the results of network analyses to explore the network structure between these constructs.

169,Nowhere to go: Parents' descriptions of children's physical activity during a global pandemic,"Objective: The purpose of the study was to understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children’s physical activity. Design: Open-ended survey Setting: Online Method: Data were collected from 335 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children’s opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children’s physical activity through their involvement and encouragement. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of access to outdoor spaces and equipment for increasing children’s physical activity. Findings can be used by educators and policy makers to equitably support families of lower socioeconomic status who reported less access to outdoor spaces.",Deanna Perez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-324-6C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-324-6C1,2020-12-17,2020-12-18T08:16:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; health; active play; covid-19; children; families,False
170,Changes in work culture and workplace due to COVID19 crisis,"Across the world when the deadly COVID-19 virus started spreading, severe health issues and death rates increased amongst thousands of people in a noticeably short period. The one and the only way to stop the transmission of the virus was to stop economic and social activities in the affected countries for an indefinite time. This research covers three main sections which are growing variations in work practices that have remained essential to stop the spread, including compulsory working from home, psychological and financial impacts that are noticeable in the aftermath of COVID-19, which includes idleness, mental illness, and dependence. Besides, the potential moderating factor of age is also examined. This research intends to deliver a consolidative methodology for studying the consequences of COVID-19 on work cultures and workplaces along with pinpointing issues for further work and understandings to advise solutions.",Gurmeet Singh,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E4-8F0-2EF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E4-8F0-2EF,2020-12-17,2020-12-18T07:53:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology,False
171,Correlates and Outcomes of Pandemic Fatigue,"In response to the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments and health-authorities have both recommended and mandated various measures aiming to contain the spread of the virus and, in turn, save lives. Despite generally high levels of compliance with and public support for these measures, several countries have witnessed a recent upsurge in the number of people who no longer sufficiently adhere to the restrictions and keep themselves informed about the pandemic. This developing trend has either been named or attributed to Pandemic Fatigue. Notably, though, a scientific conceptualization, including an identification of Pandemic fatigue and theoretical dissociation from its correlates and outcomes, is completely lacking. Using representative survey data from Denmark and Germany (overall N = 5,841), we introduce a psychometrically sound measure of Pandemic Fatigue, show who experiences it, identify related emotions and perceptions, and reveal its effects on health protective behaviors. We find that Pandemic Fatigue consists of two distinct, yet highly correlated dimensions – Information and Behavioral Fatigue – and that younger, healthier, and less educated people are more likely to experience it. Further, we find that Pandemic Fatigue is related to certain emotions and perceptions that could be targeted through different interventions in an attempt to reinvigorate fatigued individuals. Moreover, we find that Pandemic Fatigue is a strong predictor of nonadherence to health protective measures, even beyond other relevant emotions and perceptions. Taken together, the results call for a multifaceted approach towards keeping public compliance high when facing a pandemic.",Lau Lilleholt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-D9F-581,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-D9F-581,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T21:27:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
172,Mood variability among early adolescents in times of social constraints: A daily diary study during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental regulations have drastically changed the daily social lives of children, adolescents and adults. Changes in the social context may particularly affect children who are in the transition to adolescents (henceforth referred to as early adolescents) as adolescence is a crucial period for peer interactions and development of independence and autonomy. Yet, the impact of the pandemic and associated governmental regulations on early adolescents’ emotional well-being has yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored daily fluctuations in mood in 54 early adolescents (Mage = 11.07) during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the role of parents and peers on adolescents’ mood variability was investigated. Adolescents rated their mood (i.e., happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety) and peer interactions once a day during four separate weeks across different weeks of containment measures in the Netherlands. Moreover, adolescents reported on their experienced attachment to parents and peers and internalizing problems during baseline and the final measurement, respectively. Results showed relatively stable levels of mood during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual differences in mood variability during the first assessment week were negatively associated with the experienced level of attachment to both parents and peers. Moreover, heightened levels of mood variability did not mediate the link between attachment and internalizing problems. Lastly, the quality of offline contact, but not online contact, was negatively related to adolescents’ mood variability. Overall, this study suggests that mental well-being of early adolescents may not necessarily be affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and that social connectedness to parents or peers may facilitate resilience to distress and daily mood fluctuation in early adolescents.",Susanne Asscheman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-4D6-ED9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-4D6-ED9,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T21:21:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development,False
173,Self-Interest Bias in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Own Self-Serving Behaviors Are Judged More Leniently than Others’ in the US but not China,"In the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries attempt to enforce new social norms to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus. A key to the success of these measures is the individual adherence to norms that are collectively beneficial to contain the spread of the pandemic. However, individuals’ self-interest bias (i.e., the prevalent tendency to license own but not others’ self-serving acts or norm violations) can pose a challenge to the success of such measures. The current research examines COVID-19-related self-interest bias from a cross-cultural perspective. Two studies (N = 1,558) sampled from the US and China, and consistently revealed that US participants evaluated their own self-serving acts (exploiting disinfectants or test kits in Study 1; social gathering and sneezing without covering the mouth in Study 2) as more acceptable than identical deeds of others, while such self-interest bias did not emerge among Chinese participants. Cultural underpinnings of independent vs. interdependent self-construal may influence the extent to which individuals apply self-interest bias to justifications of their own self-serving behaviors during the pandemic.",Mengchen Dong et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-941-BF7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-941-BF7,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T21:06:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology|Cross-cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; norm violation; covid-19; moral judgment; self-interest bias; culture,False
174,Risk Preferences and Risk Perception Affect the Acceptance of Digital Contact Tracing,"Digital contact-tracing applications (DCTAs) can control the spread of epidemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic. But people in Western societies fail to accept DCTAs. Understanding the low acceptance is key to policymakers who support DCTAs to avoid harsh nationwide lock-downs. In a preregistered study in a representative Swiss sample (N=757), we compare the role of individual risk perception, risk preferences, social preferences, and social values in the acceptance of and compliance with DCTA. The results show a low acceptance of DCTAs but high compliance with the measures recommended by DCTAs. Risk preferences and perceptions, but not social preferences, influenced accepting DCTAs; a high health risk perception and a low data-security risk perception increased acceptance. Additionally, supporting political measures, technical abilities, and understanding the DCTA functionality had large effects on accepting DCTAs. Therefore, we recommend highlighting personal health risks and clearly explaining DCTAs, focusing on data security, to enhance DCTA acceptance.",Rebecca Albrecht et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-45C-FB1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-45C-FB1,2020-12-01,2020-12-17T20:27:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; risk; social values; contact tracing; corona virus; covid,False
175,Is stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity a pathway linking positive and negative emotionality to carotid intima-media thickness?,"Stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity, trait positive emotionality, and negative emotionality are all associated with cardiovascular disease. It is unknown, however, whether cardiovascular reactivity may constitute a pathway by which trait positive or negative emotionality relates to disease risk. Accordingly, this study modeled the cross-sectional relationships between trait positive and negative emotionality, stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity, and severity of a subclinical vascular marker of cardiovascular risk, carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT). The sample consisted of healthy, midlife adults free from clinical cardiovascular disease (N = 286; ages 30-54; 50% female). Trait positive and negative emotionality were measured by three questionnaires. Heart rate and blood pressure reactivity were assessed across three stressor tasks. CA-IMT was assessed by ultrasonography. Latent factors of positive and negative emotionality, blood pressure reactivity, heart rate reactivity, and CA-IMT were created using structural equation modeling. Greater negative emotionality was marginally associated with more CA-IMT (β = .21; p = .049), but lower blood pressure reactivity (β = -.19; p = .03). However, heightened blood pressure (β = .21; p = .03), but not heart rate reactivity (β = -.05; p = .75), associated with greater CA-IMT. Positive emotionality was uncorrelated with cardiovascular reactivity (blood pressure: β = -.04; p = .61; heart rate: β = .16; p = .11) and CA-IMT (β = .16; p = .07). Although trait negative emotionality associates with a known marker of cardiovascular disease risk, independent of positive emotionality, it is unlikely via a stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity pathway.",Caitlin Marie Dupont et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-604-781,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-604-781,2020-07-30,2020-12-17T13:29:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; atherosclerosis; negative emotions; stress physiology; positive emotions,False
176,Analysis System for Emotional Behavior in Football (ASEB-F): Matches of FC Red Bull Salzburg without Supporters during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Draft version 2 06-12-2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic the “Austrian Bundesliga” – as in many other European football leagues – resumed the season around the end of May 2020 without supporters in the stadiums. These so-called “ghost games” represent a unique and unprecedented opportunity to study the effects of the (missing) audience on the behavior and experience of sports professionals. The present study is the first of its kind, aimed at addressing the psychological effects of these “ghost games” on football players, staff, and officials. The newly developed “Analysis System for Emotional Behavior in Football” (ASEB-F) was used to video analyze and compare the behavior of players, staff, and officials in – in sum – 20 games of FC Red Bull Salzburg in the “Championship Groups” of season 2018/19 (“regular games”) and season 2019/20 (“ghost games”). Additionally, the two seasons were compared based on official matchday statistics. Overall, there were 19.5% fewer emotional situations in “ghost games” than in “regular games”. The results further show a relative increase in the number of emotional behaviors “Self-Adaptor” (+0.8%), “Protest” (+4.2%) and “Fair-Play-Behavior” (+3.1%) in “ghost games”, whereas “Words fight” (-5.1%) and “Discussion” (-5.1%) decreased in “ghost games”. In “regular games” referees were actively involved in 39.4% of all documented emotional situations, whereas in “ghost games” referees were actively involved in only 25.2% of all documented emotional situations (-14.2%). Chronological analysis within games – from kick-on to kick-off – further shows substantial differences in the temporal occurrence of emotional behavior between “regular games” and “ghost games”. The study provides unprecedented insights into the effects of missing supporters in the football games during the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional behavior on the pitch. Without the external factor of supporters, players and staff acted more factually and got less carried away with longer lasting and extensive “Words fights” and “Discussion”. The evidence from this study indicates that – from a sport psychological perspective – the absence of supporters has a substantial influence on the experience and behavior of players, staff, and officials alike.",Michael Christian Leitner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-9D2-64E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-9D2-64E,2020-08-05,2020-12-17T12:58:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Nonverbal Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; nonverbal behavior; sport psychology; covid-19; human behavior; referees; sports performance; home advantage; soccer; no supporters; no crowd; football; ghost games,False
177,Sport Psychological Effects of Missing Supporters in European Elite Football during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Draft version 2 17-12-2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, European top football (soccer) leagues played the final rounds of season 2019/20 without or strongly limited attendance of supporters (i.e., “ghost games”). From a sport psychological perspective this situation poses a unique opportunity to investigate the crowd’s influence on sports professionals’ behavior and performance. A total of 1286 matches - played in the top leagues of Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Austria and the Czech Republic - were analyzed for results, points, goals, fouls, bookings and reasons for bookings and contrasted between respective matchdays of season 2018/19 (regular attendance) and season 2019/20 (“ghost games”). There are two main findings. First, the overall home advantage effect in the respective elite leagues - identified in the respective matches of the regular 2018/19 season - vanishes almost completely in the “ghost games” of the 2019/20 season. Consequently, home teams lose significantly more matches, whereas away teams win significantly more matches. Second, home teams are booked significantly more often with yellow cards for committing fouls in “ghost games” relative to regular games. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that this effect is independent on whether the home teams are leading, trailing, or drawing in score. We conclude that missing supporters in European elite football leagues dissolve the “home advantage” effect. This missing support of the “home crowd” has a significant psychological effect on the experience, behavior and performance of home teams and/or officials. The effect is evident in the awarding of yellow cards for fouls for home teams, but not for away teams. There are (at least) three possible explanations: (1) Due to missing supporters, players experience an unfamiliar reduction of arousal and drive, (2) players lack the positive support from the home crowd, resulting in increased dysfunctional aggressive behavior and/or (3) without the pressure from the ranks, referees act more objectively in their decision making.",Michael Christian Leitner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46079-0B7-EDC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46079-0B7-EDC,2020-09-09,2020-12-17T12:57:30+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; sport; yellow cards; performance; ghost games; home advantage; crowd; fans; behavior; psychology; supporters; football; covid-19; soccer",False
178,Underweighting of rare events in social interactions and its implications to the design of voluntary health applications,"Research on small decisions from experience suggests that people often behave as if they underweight rare events and choose the options that are frequently better. In a pandemic, this tendency implies complacency and reckless behavior. Furthermore, behavioral contagion exacerbates this problem. In two pre-registered experiments (Ntotal = 312), we validate these predictions and highlight a potential solution. Groups of participants played a repeated social game in one of two versions. In the basic version, people clearly preferred the dangerous reckless behavior that was better most of the time over the safer responsible behavior. In the augmented version, we gave participants an additional alternative abstracting the use of an application that frequently saves time but can sometimes have high costs. This alternative was stochastically dominated by the option abstracting the responsible choice and was thus normatively “irrelevant” to the decision participants made. Nevertheless, most people chose the new (“irrelevant”) alternative, providing the first clear demonstration of underweighting of rare events in fully described social games. We discuss public policies that can make the responsible use of health applications better most of the time, thus helping them get traction despite being voluntary. In one field demonstration of this idea amid the COVID-19 pandemic, usage rates of a contact tracing application among nursing home employees more than tripled when using the app also started saving them little time on a daily basis, and the high usage rates sustained over at least four weeks.",Ori Plonsky et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-4EE-84F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-4EE-84F,2020-11-18,2020-12-17T12:40:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; covid-19; behavioral game theory; decisions from experience,False
179,Refuting Spurious COVID-19 Treatment Claims Reduces Demand and Misinformation Sharing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of health misinformation, which has had serious consequences including direct harm and opportunity costs. We investigated (N = 678) the impact of such misinformation on hypothetical demand (i.e., willingness-to-pay) for an unproven treatment, and propensity to promote (i.e., like or share) misinformation online. This is a novel approach, as previous research has used mainly questionnaire-based measures of reasoning. We also tested two interventions to counteract the misinformation, contrasting a tentative refutation based on materials used by health authorities with an enhanced refutation based on best-practice recommendations. We found prior exposure to misinformation increased misinformation promotion (by 18%). Both tentative and enhanced refutations reduced demand (by 18% and 25%, respectively) as well as misinformation promotion (by 29% and 55%).

180,The Attitudes of Medical Students for Their Roles and Social Accountability in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,"Introduction In this study, we aimed to explore the attitude of medical students toward their roles and social accountability in this pandemic era. An online survey asked questions covering the topics of 1) the role of medical students in the pandemic era; 2) Medical education in the ‘new normal,’ and 3) the impact of COVID-19 on medical students. Methods The online survey, developed by a team consisting of 3 medical students, 3 psychiatric residents, and 3 psychiatric professors, was distributed to medical students, graduates, and professors in a single South Korean medical school. Anxiety symptom rating scales, including the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic - 6 (SAVE-6) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scale, were also applied to measure participant anxiety level. Results All of the 213 medical students, 180 graduates, and 181 professors that participated in this online survey were at the same medical school. Medical students indicated their willingness to join the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic if requested; however, graduates and professors recommended that medical students continue their medical school curriculum rather than join the response. In the new normal era, medical education was considered to be changed appropriately. Moreover, adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection and spread must be considered for the continuation of clinical clerkships during the pandemic. Overall, medical students who indicated anxiety about treating possible or confirmed cases rated higher on the SAVE-6 scale. Finally, medical students who reported that COVID-19 had an influence on their studies and daily life rated higher on the general anxiety scale (GAD-7). Conclusion Social accountability is an important issue for medical students in the pandemic era. At the same time, cultivating professionalism is also important for the readiness for the future healthcare responses.",Jihoon Hong et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-5BC-64B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-5BC-64B,2020-08-19,2020-12-17T06:45:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; pandemic; covid-19; medical students; education,False
181,Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress,"Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of monitoring the mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents during this pandemic and targeting perceived stress and isolation in high-risk youth.",Ian Gotlib et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F,2020-06-19,2020-12-16T23:19:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; covid-19; perceived stress; depression; early life stress; adolescence,False
182,Written benefit finding for improving psychological health during the Covid-19 pandemic first wave lockdown,"Objectives. Written benefit finding has been associated with improvements in psychological and physical health in a range of patient groups. In the present study, we aimed to test the efficacy of written benefit finding, delivered online during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, on self-reported anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms. We also sought to investigate the moderating role of perseverative thinking on these effects. Design. A quantitative longitudinal design was employed. Methods. Participants (n = 91, 33 males, Mage = 37.6, SDage = 15.5; 58 females, Mage = 40.0, SDage = 13.7) completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms at baseline, and again two weeks after being randomised to complete three consecutive days of writing about the positive thoughts and feelings they’ve experienced in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic (written benefit finding condition) or to unemotively describe the events of the previous day (control condition). Self-reported state anxiety was measured immediately before and after writing. Perseverative thinking was also measured at baseline. Results. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety in the written benefit finding condition, relative to the control condition. Anxiety and depression decreased between baseline and the two week follow-up, but this did not differ significantly between the two conditions. Perseverative thinking was negatively associated with changes in anxiety, depression and stress, but did not moderate any writing effects. Conclusions. Written benefit finding may be a useful intervention for improving wellbeing, specifically state anxiety, in the general population.",Sarah Hansen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-034-DF4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-034-DF4,2020-12-15,2020-12-16T02:43:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress,False
183,The values of survival: Socio-cultural values predict COVID-19-related mortality,"Preexisting conditions affect disease susceptibility. Here, I show that socio-cultural values are population-level risk factors for disease. Using data from the World Values Survey, I show that, between 2 weeks and 6 months after the first COVID-19-related death in a country, COVID-19-related mortality is increased in countries endorsing values related to political participation, but decreased in countries with more trust in institutions and materialistic orientations. After controlling for income, age, urbanicity, smoking, overweight, private health expenditure and lockdown delay, these socio-cultural values were consistent across country-sets, reduced prediction errors by up to 52% and explained up to 68% of inter-country variability. They were relatively specific to COVID-19-related mortality. I could not identify values predicting general health outcomes, and values predicting increased COVID-19-related mortality predicted decreased mortality due to other causes like environmental-related mortality, explaining up to 90% of inter-country variability. Socio-cultural values might be specific predictors of health outcomes.",Ansgar D Endress,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-5A6-CFA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-5A6-CFA,2020-12-03,2020-12-15T17:38:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
184,Parenting in a Pandemic: Parental Stress During the Physical Distancing Intervention Following the onset of the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective: The main aim of the study was to examine levels of parental stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general parental population (N = 2868) during the strict government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further investigated specific predictors of parental distress, including burnout, anger aimed at children, worry, lack of social support, lower perceived self-efficacy, and difficulty to work from home. Method: In this cross-sectional, epidemiological study, we disseminate an online survey that was administered two weeks after the government-initiated physical distancing protocols were established. Data were collected from March 31 to April 7. Results: Female parents compared to male parents and parents living with more than one child per parent or child(ren) with special needs compared to those living with one or fewer children per parent reported higher levels of parental stress. Burnout and social support were further associated with parental stress. Specifically, nearly one-fourth of the parents reported that they have felt burned out or in the proximity of feeling burned out more than half the days during the social distancing interventions. Also, 29% of the parents reported that they were angrier at their child(ren) than usual during the physical distancing period. Parents with a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis had significantly higher parental stress compared to individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms above standardized cutoff levels among the 2868 parents was 25.4% for depression and 24.1% for anxiety, with the highest prevalence score on both symptoms of anxiety (37.6%) and depression (38.5%) for the youngest parents (age group 21–30 years). Furthermore, the parents who were home with their children and predominantly followed distancing protocol by socially distancing from public activity and peers (i.e., at least 10 out of 14 days) had significantly higher symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (27%), compared to parents who did not isolate in the same manner (i.e., depression 13% and anxiety 15%). Conclusions: The present study reveals that home confinement during the restricted lockdown period is related to markedly high levels of parental stress, in addition to symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents. Given the detrimental effects of depression, anxiety, and parental stress on the quality of life, morbidity rates, as well as adverse child outcomes and the potential risk of child abuse and neglect, these results suggest that appropriate action should be taken to impede further development of these symptoms, as well as developing interventions aimed at vulnerable subgroups and other relevant factors associated with increased parental stress.

185,Musical Engagement and Parent-Child Attachment in Families with Young Children During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of families in the United States and across the world, impacting parent mental health and stress, and in turn, the parent-child relationship. Music is a common parent-child activity and has been found to positively impact relationships, but little is known about music’s role in parent-child interactions during a pandemic. The current study utilized an online questionnaire to assess the use of music in the home of young children and their parents in the USA and Canada during Covid-19 and its relationship with parents’ affective attachment with their child. Musical activity was high for both parents and children. Parents reported using music for both emotion regulation and to socially connect with their children. Parent-child musical engagement was associated with parent-child attachment, controlling for relevant parent variables including parent distress, efficacy, education and parent-child engagement in non-musical activities. These results indicate that music may be an effective tool for building and maintaining parent-child relationships during a period of uncertainty and change.",Selena Steinberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-69F-509,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-69F-509,2020-12-14,2020-12-15T05:57:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; parent-child attachment; music; covid-19; parent-child interactions; early childhood,False
186,Cultural influence on COVID-19 cognitions and growth speed: the role of cultural collectivism,"Many challenges faced by humans require large-scale cooperation for communal benefits. We examined what motivates such cooperation in the context of social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the transmission intensity of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We hypothesized that collectivism, a cultural variable characterizing the extent that individuals see themselves in relation to others, contributes to people’s willingness to engage in these behaviors. Consistent with preregistered predictions, across three studies (n=2864), including a U.S. nationally representative sample, people’s collectivist orientation is positively associated with intentions, positive beliefs, norm perceptions, and policy support for the preventive behaviors. In separate analyses at the country level (n=69 countries), more collectivist countries demonstrated lower growth rate in both COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Together, these studies demonstrate the positive role of collectivism at the individual- and country-level in reducing COVID-19 transmission, and highlight the need to consider culture in public health policies and communications.",Rui Pei et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-4BB-402,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-4BB-402,2020-12-15,2020-12-15T05:54:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences,False
187,Factors associated with Adherence to Social Distancing Protocols and Hygienic Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: To investigate factors associated with adherence to viral mitigation strategies recommended by the WHO during the COVID-19 pandemic, including adherence to social distancing protocols (SDPs) and adherence to hygienic behavior recommendations (HB). Design: This pre-registered epidemiological study of 4158 adults examines the association between situational, cognitive, affective, behavioral, and personality-based factors with adherence to SDPs and HB during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further investigates the relationship between central information sources and adherence behavior. Main Outcome Measures: Adherence to social distancing protocols (SDPs) and adherence to hygienic behavior recommendations (HB). Results: Individuals aged between 18-30 reported lowest adherence to SDPs and HB. Greater alcohol consumption was associated with decreased adherence to SDP and HB. Increased risk perception, fear of infection, conscientious personality, and altruistic attitude was associated with greater adherence to SDPs and HB. Males, single individuals, employed individuals, and those without children reported lower adherence to SDPs and HB. Extroverted personality and residents of urban areas were associated with lower adherence to SDPs, but not HB. In contrast to earlier stages of the pandemic, voluntary social distancing was associated with greater adherence to SDPs as opposed to rule-enforced (e.g., mandated) social distancing. Among information sources, increased time spent obtaining information from official (i.e., recognized) newspapers had the strongest favorable association with adherence to both SDPs and HB, followed by information obtainment from recognized television channels. Relying on information from friends and family was associated with decreased adherence to SDPs, but was unrelated to adherence to HB. Sensitivity analyses replicated the findings, supporting the stability and robustness of the proposed models. Conclusion: The present study identifies factors associated with favorable and detrimental adherence behavior along with substantial dissemination routes, presenting strategies which may be utility toward fostering adherence to contemporaneously implemented pandemic mitigation protocols.

188,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis is higher among young Swiss men with a lower socioeconomic status: evidence from a cohort study,"Aims The COVID-19 pandemic affected daily life worldwide. In addition to its tangible physical impacts, it may also have affected those who had been especially vulnerable already before the crisis and those who experienced substantial changes to their work situation during it. The present study aimed to investigate whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis varied with regards to young Swiss men’s pre-crisis level of education and socioeconomic status and to changes in their work situation due to it. Methods A cohort of 2345 young Swiss men (mean age = 29) completed survey-based assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Outcomes measured were psychological outcomes before and during the COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and the fear, isolation and psychological trauma induced by it. We investigated associations between these outcomes and their predictors: pre-crisis socioeconomic status (relative financial status and difficulty paying bills) and level of education, changes in work situation during the crisis (job loss, partial unemployment, working from home, change in workload) and working in contact with potentially infected people, both inside and outside the healthcare sector. Results COVID-19 changed the employment status of about 21% of participants (job loss, partial unemployment or lost money if self-employed). More than 40% worked predominantly from home during the crisis. Participants with a lower socioeconomic status experienced higher psychological impact (depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation) due to the COVID-19 crisis. A higher impact was also felt by participants who lost their job due to the COVID-19 crisis, the partially unemployed, those with an increased workload or those who worked mainly from home. Overall, working in contact with potentially infected people was not associated with psychological impact. Conclusions Even in a country like Switzerland, with relatively high social security benefits and universal healthcare, the COVID-19 crisis had a considerable psychological impact, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status and those who experienced deteriorations in their work situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Supporting these populations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of inequalities in mental health and social status.

189,Predictors and patterns of gambling behaviour across the COVID-19 lockdown: findings from a UK cohort study,"The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy is well documented, with widespread furloughs, job loss, and financial insecurity. Concerns have been raised about increases in maladaptive coping behaviours such as gambling, to offset financial losses. Similarly, as individuals spend increased time at home, new populations may initiate or increase the frequency of gambling behaviours. The current study used a large longitudinal study of UK adults (N = 32,559) to examine a range of sociodemographic, stress, and health predictors of (i) gambling during strict lockdown (March to the first week of June 2020), (ii) gambling more frequently during strict lockdown compared to before lockdown, and (iii) continued increased rates of gambling during the relaxing of lockdown restrictions (end of July/early August 2020) compared to earlier in the lockdown (late May/early June 2020). Results from a logistic regression indicated that males, older ages, the employed, those with progressively lower levels of education, who lived in overcrowded accommodation, were highly bored, frequently drank alcohol, smoked or were ex-smokers, and had high risk-taking tendencies were more likely to gamble during strict lockdown. Individuals who were more likely to have increased their frequency of gambling during strict lockdown compared to before the lockdown were highly bored, employed, frequently drank alcohol, and had depression and anxiety, whilst men and current smokers were less likely. As lockdown restrictions eased, individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds, who were current smokers, and with lower education attainment were more likely to continue gambling at heightened rates. This suggests which risk groups should be targeted and provided with more effective coping strategies.",Meg Fluharty et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EC-E56-213,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EC-E56-213,2020-12-10,2020-12-14T17:33:19+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; risk behaviours; lockdown; covid-19; gambling; coping",False
190,Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling). Supporting this idea, two studies using data from the U.K. (cross-sectional) and the U.S. (longitudinal) show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors in the past as well as in the future.",Hui Bai,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,2020-07-02,2020-12-14T16:10:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
191,Subjective Attribution of Infectious Disease Outbreaks to Climate Change is Associated with Mitigation Behavioural Intentions and COVID-19 Recovery Policy Support,"Scholars argue that personal experience with climate change related impacts has the potential to increase public engagement. Yet, previous studies, which have almost exclusively focussed on experience with extreme weather events, provide mixed results. Based on experiential learning and attribution theory, this article argues that unless individuals’ attribute an event as related to or caused by climate change, their responses may be misdirected. Results based on survey data from a nationally representative sample of the New Zealand public indicates that subjective attribution of infectious disease outbreaks to climate change and to the human impact on the environment is positively associated with mitigation behavioural intentions and policy support. In addition, political affiliation moderates the relationship between subjective attribution and mitigation policy support, indicating a higher potential for right-leaning compared to moderates or left-leaning respondents to learn about climate change through health-related climate change impacts. Helping people understand the role of human impact on the environment and climate change in infectious disease outbreaks is likely to increase public engagement.",Jagadish Thaker,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610F-450-C9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610F-450-C9D,2020-12-14,2020-12-14T13:48:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; covid-19; political affiliation; behavioural intentions; policy support; climate change; subjective attribution; infectious diseases,False
192,Pre-pandemic Autonomic Nervous System Activity Predicts Well-being during COVID-19 in Israel,"Despite the unfolding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, there is a lack of prospective studies that target physiological markers of distress. There is a need to examine physiological predictors from the pre-pandemic period to identify and treat individuals at-risk. Our aim was to use pre-pandemic markers of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation, to predict individuals' psychological well-being during the crisis. We also assessed the role of emotion regulation as a mediator of the association between pre-pandemic physiological measures and COVID-related well-being. In May-June 2020, 185 Israeli adults completed online questionnaires assessing their emotional regulation of negative affect since COVID-19 began, and their current well-being. These individuals had participated in lab studies 1.5-3 years prior to this assessment, where their physiological measures were taken, including Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) and Skin Conductance Level (SCL). RSA was positively related to emotion regulation during COVID-19. Emotion regulation, in its turn, positively predicted well-being during the crisis. The mediation was significant and moderated by SCL (index=-0.09, 95%CI [-0.02, -0.0001]), such that it was strongest for individuals with low SCL. We point to pre-pandemic physiological mechanisms underlying individuals' mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

193,Antecedents and consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs: a rapid review of the evidence,"COVID-19 conspiracy theories emerged almost immediately after the beginning of the pandemic, and the number of believers does not appear to decline. Conspiracy beliefs can have severe consequences, such as reduced guideline adherence and vaccination intentions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand them. In this rapid review we summarize research from more than 43 publications covering research in 25 countries worldwide. We evaluate the contribution of individual difference variables, biases and attitudes, and social factors to the beliefs, and discuss the consequences of the beliefs on safeguarding, self-centred, and misguided behaviours, vaccination intentions, and other, detrimental behaviours. We suggest that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories may be boosted by low levels of trust in a context of threat and low levels of comprehensive, accessible information in a context of unknowns.

194,"Emotions, reasoning, and mental health as predictors of behavior during three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has required people worldwide to adjust their behavior for several months in response to a crisis of rare proportions. Little is known about the specific factors that affected the progression of the public’s reactions during the pandemic. Individual factors associated with pandemic-related behavior in general, and compliance with public health measures in particular, are not firmly established. We undertook a survey of behavior, emotions, reasoning style, and mental health in the province of Quebec at the beginning, the peak, and the aftermath of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 530 responders from a convenience sample; 154 responders participated in all three surveys. Emotions were most intense at the beginning of the first wave of the pandemic, not at its peak. Responders’ compliance with three public health measures decreased between the peak and the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic; however, mask wearing also became more common. Pandemic-related behavior in general, and compliance with public health measures specifically, were predicted by avoidance-related emotions evoked by the pandemic. Approach-related emotions linked to the societal response contributed specifically to the prediction of compliance with public health measures. In contrast, reasoning style and mental health did not as consistently predict behavior during the pandemic.

This introduction of masks into social exchanges posed a potential challenge – how would people make these important inferences about others when a large source of information was no longer available? We conducted two studies that investigated the impact of mask exposure on emotion perception. In particular, we measured how participants used facial landmarks (visual cues) and the expressed valence and arousal (affective cues), to make similarity judgements about pairs of emotion faces. Study 1 found that participants with higher levels of mask exposure used cues from the eyes to a greater extent when judging emotion similarity than participants with less mask exposure. Study 2 measured participants’ emotion perception in both April and September 2020 – before and after widespread mask adoption – in the same group of participants to examine changes in the use of facial cues over time. Results revealed an overall increase in the use of visual cues from April to September. Further, as mask exposure increased, people with the most social interaction showed the largest increase in the use of visual facial cues. These results provide evidence that a shift has occurred in how people process faces such that the more people are interacting with others that are wearing masks, the more they have learned to focus on visual cues from the eye area of the face.",Elyssa M Barrick et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-F4F-638,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-F4F-638,2020-12-11,2020-12-13T07:14:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; face processing; emotion; perception; covid,False
196,Longitudinal Analysis of Short-term Changes in Relationship Conflict During COVID-19: A Risk and Resilience Perspective,"This study uses a risk and resilience framework to examine short-term self-reported changes in relationship conflict early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March and April 2020). Longitudinal data from U.S. adults in a romantic relationship (N = 291) were collected via three waves of an online survey. Participants self-reported anxiety, depression, increased alcohol use, and dyadic coping since the pandemic. Relationship conflict variables included whether the participant reported that they and their partner “had disagreements related to the Coronavirus,” “had more disagreements than usual,” “had more verbal fights than usual,” and “had more physical fights than usual” in the past 2 weeks. Analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics as well as days spent in lockdown and employment change due to COVID-19. Results indicated that couples’ disagreement and verbal fighting scores increased from Time 1 to Time 2, but disagreements related to COVID-19 and physical fighting did not. Couples with higher levels of dyadic coping reported fewer fights and disagreements on average. However, dyadic coping did not buffer participants from increases in relationship conflict. Increased alcohol use since the pandemic was positively associated with disagreements related to COVID-19, disagreement scores, and verbal fighting scores. More days spent in lockdown was associated with increases in disagreements related to COVID-19. The conditions created by COVID-19 may contribute to worsening relationship conflict, even among couples who start with high levels of dyadic coping. Depression and alcohol use may contribute to poorer relationship quality during the pandemic. There is need for enhanced intervention and mental health supports to mitigate the potential effects of the pandemic on couples’ relationship functioning.",Shawna J.

197,Of Pathogens and Party Lines: Social Conservatism Positively Associates with COVID-19 Precautions among U.S. Democrats but not Republicans,"Consistent with a threat-bias model of ideological differences, social liberals have been shown to be less pathogen-avoidant than tradition-valuing social conservatives. However, particularly when pathogen threat occurs at a societal level, additional factors may influence individual responses. In the current pandemic, the more socially conservative U.S. political party has consistently downplayed the dangers of COVID-19. This creates a natural experiment, allowing examination of the contributions of multiple factors to disease avoidance. We investigated the relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautionary behavior in light of the partisan landscape, exploring whether consumption of, and attitudes toward, different sources of information, as well as differential evaluation of various threats caused by the pandemic—such as direct health costs versus indirect harms to the economy and individual liberties—shape political differences in responses to the pandemic in ways that mask the contributions of social conservatism. In two studies, socially conservative attitudes correlate with self-reported COVID-19 prophylactic behaviors, but only among Democrats. Reflecting larger societal divisions, among Republicans and Independents, the positive relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautions is jointly suppressed by lower trust in scientists, lower trust in liberal and moderate sources, lesser consumption of liberal news media, and greater economic conservatism.",Theodore Samore et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46112-9E1-F5C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46112-9E1-F5C,2020-08-08,2020-12-11T20:12:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; political differences; pathogen avoidance; covid-19; social conservatism; traditionalism,False
198,Disease and Disapproval: COVID-19 Concern is Related to Greater Moral Condemnation,"Prior research has indicated that disgust, a manifestation of the behavioral immune system, is associated with harsher moral condemnation. However, the link between physical disgust—an evolved signal of risks to one’s health—and morality has been contentious. We investigated the role of a specific health concern, namely the spread of the coronavirus, and associated COVID-19 disease, on moral condemnation. We hypothesized that individuals who report greater subjective worry about COVID-19 would be more sensitive to moral transgressions. Across 3 studies (N = 913), conducted March-May 2020 as the pandemic started to unfold in the United States, we found that individuals who were worried about contracting the infectious disease made harsher moral judgments than those who were not worried. This effect was not restricted to transgressions involving purity, but extended to transgressions involving harm, fairness, authority, and loyalty, and remained when controlling for political orientation. We furthermore observed suggestive evidence that even relatively unconcerned individuals became more judgmental as the epidemic wore on. These findings add to the growing literature that concrete threats to health can play a role in abstract moral considerations, supporting the notion that judgments of wrongdoing are not based on rational thought alone.",Robert K.

199,Adverse and Benevolent Childhood Experiences Predict Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer adult mental health, and benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) are associated with better adult mental health. Objective. To test whether ACEs and BCEs predict adult mental health beyond current stress and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting. We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (N = 502) at an urban private university in the western United States. Methods. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Results. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, β = 0.45, p = .002. Higher levels of BCEs were associated with lower depressive symptoms, β = -0.39, p = .03, lower perceived stress, β = -0.26, p = .002, and less loneliness, β = -0.12, p = .04. These associations held while controlling for current stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions. Childhood experiences are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. BCEs should be considered an important promotive factor, independent of ACEs, for psychological well-being during a global public health crisis. BCEs should be included along with ACEs in future research and screening with distressed and vulnerable populations.",Jenalee Doom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A6-C2F-979,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A6-C2F-979,2020-12-03,2020-12-07T02:33:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; stress; adverse childhood experiences; loneliness; social support; pandemic; depression; benevolent childhood experiences; covid-19; anxiety; perceived stress; adversity; positive childhood experiences; mental health,False
200,Stress as a meaningful variable in models of covid-19 spreading,"Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus – 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019. Because of Covid-19 worldwide spreading in 2020, urgent hygiene and lockdown measures have been implemented with fundamental consequences on the lives of people in all sectors of society. Besides visible socio-economic and documented health effects, the impact of Covid-19 on people’s mental health including stress-related effects on disease spreading remains yet to be addressed.

201,Memories of School Recess Predict Physical Activity Enjoyment and Social-Emotional Well-being in Adults,"School recess can provide social, emotional, and physical benefits for children. Yet, not all children experience recess the same, as inequity in access to recess and variability in the quality of recess exist. Researchers have yet to understand the long-term implications of recess experiences on adult well-being and physical activity behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore the inter-relationships between memories of recess, physical activity, and social-emotional well-being. A total of 514 adults between the ages of 19 and 79 (M = 45.56; SD = 15.62) were surveyed via Prolific, a web-based research platform. Participants were asked about their memories of recess enjoyment and recess exclusion, physical activity levels, physical activity enjoyment, social isolation, social role satisfaction, and sense of meaning and purpose. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that memories of recess enjoyment was associated with meaning and purpose (β = .140, p < .05) and PA enjoyment (β = .209, p < .05). Furthermore, recess exclusion predicted current social isolation (β = .300, p< .05) and was negatively associated with recess enjoyment (β = -.445, p< .05). Findings highlight the importance of childhood recess experiences and its impact on subsequent physical activity behaviors, social isolation, and meaning and purpose later in life. Consistent with other research, early positive activity experiences, in the form of recess, appears to provide more assurances that one will engage in healthier lifestyle behaviors and more favorable psycho-socio-emotional profiles in adulthood.",William Massey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-7BE-C6A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-7BE-C6A,2020-12-05,2020-12-05T10:25:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; children; health; school; social-emotional; recess,False
202,Psychological determinants of emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Fear and anxiety about COVID-19 has swept across the globe. Understanding the factors that contribute to increasing emotional distress regarding the pandemic is paramount—especially as experts warn about rising cases. Despite large amounts of data, it remains unclear which variables are essential for predicting who will be most affected by the distress of future waves. We collected cross-sectional data on a multitude of socio-psychological variables from a sample of 948 United States participants during the early stages of the pandemic. Using a cross-validated hybrid stepwise procedure, we developed a descriptive model of COVID-19 emotional distress. Results reveal that trait anxiety, gender, and social (but not government) media consumption were the strongest predictors of increasing emotional distress. In contrast, commonly associated variables, such as age and political ideology, exhibited much less unique explanatory power. Together, these results can help public health officials identify which populations will be especially vulnerable to experiencing COVID-19 related emotional distress.",Joseph Heffner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607F-1EB-796,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607F-1EB-796,2020-11-02,2020-12-04T17:15:35+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; emotion distress; gender; media; anxiety; covid-19",False
203,The values of survival: Socio-cultural values predict COVID-19-related mortality,"Preexisting conditions affect disease susceptibility. Here, I show that socio-cultural values are population-level risk factors for disease. Using data from the World Values Survey, I show that, between 2 weeks and 6 months after the first COVID-19-related death in a country, COVID-19-related mortality is increased in countries endorsing values related to political participation, but decreased in countries with more trust in institutions and materialistic orientations. After controlling for income, age, urbanicity, smoking, overweight, private health expenditure and lockdown delay, these socio-cultural values were consistent across country-sets, reduced prediction errors by up to 52% and explained up to 68% of inter-country variability. They were relatively specific to COVID-19-related mortality. I could not identify values predicting general health outcomes, and values predicting increased COVID-19-related mortality predicted decreased mortality due to other causes like environmental-related mortality, explaining up to 90% of inter-country variability. Socio-cultural values might be specific predictors of health outcomes.",Ansgar D Endress,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-181-71B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-181-71B,2020-12-03,2020-12-04T03:30:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology|Cross-cultural Psychology,False
204,From ‘It has stopped our lives’ to ‘Spending more time together has strengthened bonds': The varied experiences of Australian families during COVID-19,"The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8th and April 28th, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including: 'Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion'; 'Families are missing the things that keep them healthy'; 'Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy'; 'The unprecedented demands of parenthood'; 'The unequal burden of COVID-19'; and 'Holding on to positivity'. Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude and tolerance.",Subhadra Evans et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5,2020-08-17,2020-12-03T22:51:29+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; social restrictions; qualitative; covid-19; australia; family relationships",False
205,"Behavioural pre-testing of COVID Tracker, Ireland’s contact-tracing app","Contact-tracing mobile phone apps have the potential to play a role in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but their success hinges on widespread uptake by the public. We report a study that behaviourally pre-tested COVID Tracker, Ireland's contact-tracing app, prior to its launch with a large sample of smartphone users. The study was funded by the Department of Health and run in cooperation with the app's developers, NearForm. Participants were randomised to receive different versions of a trial app. They responded to an online survey while downloading and using the app on their phones in real time. The experimental manipulations focused on three broad areas: (i) the level of privacy assurance provided in the app, (ii) the goal-framing of the purpose of the app and (iii) the structuring of the exposure notification received by users if they are recorded as a close contact. Almost one in five participants mentioned privacy concerns in relation to their likelihood of downloading the app. Including additional assurances regarding the privacy of users' data in the app successfully lowered participants' privacy concerns and boosted engagement. This finding fed into the final version of the app released in July 2020. We also found minor beneficial effects of restructuring the exposure notification, but did not find any significant differences between two different types of goal-framing, other than a subtle effect on how the exposure notification is interpreted. Overall, our results demonstrate the value of pre-testing contact-tracing apps from a behavioural perspective to boost uptake, trust and participation.",Hannah Julienne et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-ED0-3D1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-ED0-3D1,2020-12-03,2020-12-03T19:24:04+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; contact tracing app; privacy concern; covid-19",False
206,"Dissociation between the Language Network and the Multiple Demand (MD) Network, and Their Functional Roles in Language","Language operations rely on multiple mental activities that are supported by the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Moreover, these cortices are not organized into individual isolated previous but rather consist of multiple large-scale networks: sets of brain regions that share structural and functional properties. Literature generally agrees with two well documented systems in the human brain, which are the language network, and the multiple demand (MD) network. Studies have reported both the participation of language network (e.g., Fedorenko et al., 2010, Vagharchakian et al., 2012; Fedorenko et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2017; Deniz et al., 2019) and MD network in language (e.g., Kuperberg et al., 2003; Rodd et al., 2005, Novais-Santos et al., 2007; January et al., 2009; Peelle et al., 2010; Nieuwland et al., 2012; McMillan et al., 2013), but their possible role in language is debated. In this paper, we review how the language-specific and domain-general MD systems support different aspects of cognition and how they can be dissociated from one another. We argue that core language operations are supported by the language network rather than the MD network, and the MD network does not contribute directly to language recovery after stroke, but plays a role in the recovery of other cognitive functions that are engaged in the same language task.",Weixi Kang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-5EB-26E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-5EB-26E,2020-12-03,2020-12-03T19:16:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; multiple demand network; language production; language network; executive control; language processing; aphasia recovery,False
207,"Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Impacts in Michigan, USA","Racial disparities have been observed in the impacts of COVID-19 in the United States. In this paper, we used a representative sample of adults in Michigan to examine differences in COVID-19 impacts on Blacks and Whites in four domains: direct, perceived, political, and behavioral. We found that in the initial wave of the outbreak in May 2020, Blacks experienced more severe direct impacts: they were more likely to be diagnosed or know someone who was diagnosed, and more likely to lose their job compared to Whites. Additionally, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19's threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19's spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks. Continued investigation of racial disparities in COVID-19's impact is necessary, however these preliminary findings of a race-by-ideology interaction are important because they suggest some racial disparities are restricted to conservatives, while more liberal Whites and Blacks exhibit few differences.",Kaston D Anderson-Carpenter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-BA1-ADF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-BA1-ADF,2020-09-19,2020-12-02T17:04:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; ideology; race; covid-19; racial disparity; covid,False

Across both samples social distancing was associated with decreased need fulfillment. German participants reported higher need fulfillment compared to American participants. In comparison to previous studies, self-related needs associated with social distancing were less impacted than under experimental manipulations of social exclusion, however more so than under the baseline condition of inclusion. Working while social distancing was associated with greater need fulfillment, as was identifying as male.

209,Having a Prevention Regulatory Focus Longitudinally Predicts Distress and Health-Protective Behaviors During the COVID-9 Pandemic,"Background: Past research has shown that regulatory focus shapes people’s health and well-being, with those who are focused on prevention (vs. promotion) being more motivated by safety and being less inclined to take risks. Purpose: In the current study, we tested if having a prevention (vs. promotion) focus before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak predicted perceptions and health outcomes and threat over the course of the pandemic. Methods: Participants (N = 161, 51.6% women; Mage = 34.04, SD = 7.77) took part in a longitudinal study. Measures were assessed before the pandemic was declared (in November 2019, T1) and after a global pandemic was declared (on June 2020, T2). Results: Results suggest that people who were more focused on prevention prior to the onset of the pandemic (at T1) perceived greater risk of contracting COVID-19, were more worried about being infected, and engaged in more preventative behaviors during the pandemic (at T2). Additionally, they also reported less anxiety and felt healthier (at T2). Conclusions: People focused on prevention (i.e., motivated by security) are more aware of health threats and more likely to engage in health-protective behaviors.

210,Willingness to Use an Approved COVID-19 Vaccine: Cross-National Evidence on Levels and Individual-Level Predictors,"The management of the COVID-19 pandemic critically hinges on the approval of safe and effective vaccines but, equally importantly, on high willingness among lay people to use vaccines when approved. To facilitate vaccination willingness via effective health communication, it is key to understand both levels of skepticism towards an approved COVID-19 vaccine and the demographic, psychological and political sources of this skepticism. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of willingness to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large, representative surveys from eight Western democracies that differ both politically and in terms of the severity of the pandemic: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, United Kingdom, and United States (total N = 9,889). The data reveal large variation in vaccination willingness, both across and within countries ranging from 79 % in Denmark to 38 % in Hungary. Thus, most national levels fall below current best estimates for the required threshold for reaching herd immunity. Across national and demographic groups, the analyses demonstrate that a lack of vaccination willingness is associated with low levels of trust in authorities, conspiracy-related beliefs and a lack of concern about COVID-19. These factors also account for cross-national levels in vaccine willingness.",Marie Fly Lindholt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-AAA-140,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-AAA-140,2020-11-27,2020-12-02T09:17:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
211,Joint Modeling of Individual Differences Across Predictions Mitigates the 'Paradox' of Converging Evidence: Comment on Davis-Stober and Regenwetter (2019),"Davis-Stober and Regenwetter (2019; D&R) showed that even if all predictions of a theory hold in separate studies, not even a single individual may be described by all predictions jointly. To illustrate this 'paradox' of converging evidence, D&R derived upper and lower bounds on the proportion of individuals for whom all predictions of a theory hold. These bounds reflect extreme positive and negative stochastic dependence of individual differences across predictions. However, psychological theories often make more specific and plausible assumptions, such as that true individual differences are independent or show a certain degree of consistency (e.g., due to a common underlying trait). Based on this psychometric perspective, I extend D&R's conceptual framework by developing a multivariate normal model of individual effects. Assuming perfect consistency (i.e., a correlation of one) of individual effects across predictions, the proportion of individuals described by all predictions of a theory is identical to D&R's upper bound. The proportion drops substantially when assuming independence of individual effects. However, irrespective of the assumed correlation, the multivariate normal model implies a lower bound that is strictly above D&R's lower bound if a theory makes at least three predictions. The multivariate model thus mitigates the 'paradox' of converging evidence even though it does not resolve it. Overall, scholars can improve the scope of their theories by assuming that individual effects are highly correlated across predictions.",Daniel W.

Everyday kindness enhances well-being and prosocial behavior in the time of COVID-19.,"Acts of everyday kindness are voluntary, low-cost actions intended to express a friendly attitude toward a specific person or persons. In two pre-registered studies we examined whether practicing everyday kindness can help people maintain well-being and prosocial orientation in times of pandemic. In correlational Study 1 (N = 497), performing everyday kindness was positively linked to well-being, social connectedness, and a willingness to engage in more costly prosocial behavior. In an experimental Study 2 (N = 482), practicing acts of everyday kindness increased well-being and actual prosocial behavior, although it did not affect feelings of social connectedness.

The present study set out to examine what variables were associated with resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in all sectors of frontline workers, and whether or not these differed between the UK and Republic of Ireland (RoI). Individuals were eligible if they were a frontline worker (in health and social care, community supply chain, or other emergency services) in the UK or RoI during the pandemic. Part of a larger, longitudinal study, the participants completed an online survey to assess various aspects of their daily and working lives, along with their attitudes towards their government’s handling of the crisis, and measurement of psychological variables associated with heroism (altruism, meaning in life, and resilient coping). A total of 1305 participants (N=869, 66.6% from the UK) provided sufficient data for analysis. UK-based workers reported lower wellbeing than the RoI-based participants. In multivariate models, both psychological and pandemic-related variables were associated with levels of resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in these workers, but which pandemic-related variables were associated with outcomes differed depending on the country. The judgment of lower timeliness in their government’s response to the pandemic appeared to be a key driver of each outcome for the UK-based frontline workers. These findings provide initial evidence that the different strategies adopted by each country may be associated with the overall wellbeing of frontline workers, with higher detriment observed in the UK. The judgment of the relatively slow response of the UK government to instigate their pandemic measures appears to be associated with lower resilience, higher burnout, and lower wellbeing in frontline workers in the UK.",Rachel Clair Sumner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46178-993-F57,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46178-993-F57,2020-09-25,2020-12-01T08:57:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
214,"The Mental Health Effects of Living with Close Others Before, During, and After the Onset of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic not only threatens physical health, but is also a multi-faceted stressor that threatens mental health. Given the public health focus on staying home to stem the tide of COVID-19, it is crucial to determine how the close others we live with (i.e., romantic partners or children) affect our mental health, for better or worse. We examined the month-to-month mental health (i.e., well-being and ill-being) of parents living with child(ren) and people living with romantic partners (versus people not living with these close others) from February through September 2020 in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N=656; N=544). This longitudinal approach distinguishes three unique effects: differences existing before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, differences due to the onset of the pandemic, and differences that persisted across the first six months of the pandemic. In both samples, living with child(ren) or living with a romantic partner were both protective for mental health, before and during the first six months of the pandemic. Some evidence suggests these groups experienced unique increases in ill-being during the onset of the pandemic, but their ill-being also recovered more quickly. These findings highlight the crucial protective function of close relationships for mental health both in general and amidst a pandemic, suggesting that people living without these close others may need additional support.",Natalie M.

215,Can Mindfulness Help People Implement a Growth Mindset? Two Field Experiments in Hungary,"Does holding a growth mindset prevent people from experiencing potentially negative or maladaptive thoughts and feelings following academic setbacks? Not necessarily: In our Hungarian sample, a culture high in negative affect, three-fourths of people who endorsed a growth mindset at a maximum level nonetheless reported at least sometimes being judgmental of themselves and ruminating about setbacks. Thus, in two field experiments performed in Hungary, we incorporated mindfulness elements into an existing growth-mindset intervention (Yeager et al., 2019). These elements focused on accepting but distancing the self from negative thoughts and feelings in response to setbacks. This enhanced growth-mindset treatment significantly raised semester grades among university (N=251, Study 1, d=0.29) and reported grades among high school students (N=3,095, Study 2, d=0.17). A growth-mindset intervention alone also raised GPA with an effect size similar to the effect sizes found in prior research (Study 2); however, this effect did not consistently reach significance across models with the present sample size. Although just a first step, the present studies suggest the value of incorporating mindfulness elements to help people manage a tendency toward negative and counterproductive reactions that may remain even following a mindset intervention.",Gabor Orosz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-AD8-DB5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-AD8-DB5,2020-11-25,2020-11-30T17:32:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interventions,False

The Role of Constructive Patriotism, Conventional Patriotism, and Glorification Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","We examined the link between constructive patriotism, glorification, and conventional patriotism and COVID-19-related attitudes and behaviours at different stages of the pandemic in Poland. In Study 1 (N = 663), constructive patriotism was positively associated with support for intrinsic measures (e.g., raising awareness about health practices). Glorification was negatively linked to support for such measures and positively connected to support for extrinsic measures (e.g., closing the borders). In Study 2 (N = 522), constructive patriots showed greater compliance with hygiene and social distance practices. In Study 3 (N = 633), the attribution of responsibility for fighting the crisis to the State and particularly to individuals underlined the link between constructive patriotism and compliance with health practices. Additionally, constructive patriotism was linked to support for international collaboration. Study 4 (N = 1,051), conducted on a representative sample, further corroborated these findings.

217,Paternal Depression & Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed family functioning and increased parenting demands, leading to increased risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. Emerging evidence underscores the significant impact the pandemic has had on maternal mental health concerns. In contrast, paternal mental health has yet to be described. The current study describes the prevalence of depression and anxiety in fathers of young children as well as associated risk and protective factors. Methods: As part of the Parenting during the Pandemic study, fathers (N = 70) of children age 0-8 years old self-reported on mental health symptoms and additional concerns, while mothers (N = 236) provided a partner-report of father perinatal depression. Results:. Clinically significant depression (37.1%) and anxiety (22.9%) were prevalent in fathers. Partner reported perinatal depression was prevalent in 61.9% of fathers. Higher financial strain and previous mental health history were associated with increased risk of both depression and anxiety. Maternal report of paternal depression was associated with higher financial strain, greater number of children in the home, and lower maternal-reported marital quality. Limitations: The current study used cross-sectional data from an online cohort. The sample size limits the generalizability of the findings; future research should continue evaluating this important topic with larger samples. Conclusions: Compared to pre-pandemic population comparisons, paternal depression and anxiety are elevated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

218,Strengthened beliefs under psychedelics (SEBUS)? A Commentary on “REBUS and the Anarchic Brain: Toward a Unified Model of the Brain Action of Psychedelics”,"In introducing a model of “relaxed beliefs under psychedelics” (REBUS), Carhart-Harris and Friston (2019) have presented a compelling account of the effects of psychedelics on brain and mind. This model is contextualized within the Free Energy Principle (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010), which may represent the first unified paradigm in the mind and life sciences. By this view, mental systems adaptively regulate their actions and interactions with the world via predictive models, whose dynamics are governed by a singular objective of minimizing prediction-error, or “free energy.” According to REBUS, psychedelics flatten the depth of free energy landscapes, or the differential attracting forces associated with various (Bayesian) beliefs, so promoting flexibility in inference and learning. Here, I would like to propose an alternative account of the effects of psychedelics that is in many ways compatible with REBUS, albeit with some important differences. Based on considerations of the distributions of 5-HT2a receptors within cortical laminae and canonical microcircuits for predictive coding, I propose that 5-HT2a agonism may also involve a strengthening of beliefs, particularly at intermediate levels of abstraction associated with conscious experience (Safron, 2020).",Adam Safron,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608D-58C-207,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608D-58C-207,2020-11-30,2020-11-30T07:50:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False

In Study 1, country-level collectivism negatively related to both cases (r = -.28) and deaths (r = -.40) in simple regressions; however, after controlling for covariates, the former became non-significant (rp = -.07), but the later remained significant (rp = -.20). In Study 2, state-level collectivism positively related to both cases (r = .56) and deaths (r = .41) in simple regressions, and these relationships persisted after controlling for all covariates except race, where a state’s non-White population dominated all other predictors of COVID-19 cases (rp = .35) and deaths (rp = .31).

220,Quality of life of Health care professionals in pandemic times,"The COVID-19 pandemics were an event where there was a rupture of the life pattern and people felt helpless and suffering, creating a need for basic things such as medical care and shelter against the environmental conditions. The healthcare professionals faced an unknown potential threat to life that made them work in an intense and fearful routine facing fatigue and the fear to carry the disease to their families. In order to evaluate their Quality of life, we undertook a survey in the first months of the pandemics with logistical support of the Health ministry in Brazil reaching more than 200,000 varied health professionals, with quality of life data available to 97,379 . We segregated the professionals by their reported area in Medical doctor, psychologists, social worker, nurses, pharmaceutic/biochemistry, nutritionists, physiotherapist, and speech therapists. Here we describe the findings of the reported quality of life and the features more related to the worsening of the quality of life. The different professions report a diverse quality of life, suggesting a more heterogeneous pattern of impairment.

221,Transparency Is Necessary but Not Sufficient to Reduce Skepticism About a COVID-19 Vaccine,"Health authorities emphasize the importance of ""radical transparency"" in communicating about future COVID-19 vaccines to counter conspiracy-based skepticism. While this resonates with research that highlights uncertainty as a major psychological predictor of conspiracy-related beliefs, no systematic evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of transparency as communication strategy. This study tests the effects of transparent communication about a COVID-19 vaccine using a pre-registered experiment fielded to large, representative samples of Americans and Danes (N > 6,800). The evidence confirms that positive but vague vaccine communication does not increase vaccine support but rather infuses attitudes with conspiracy-related beliefs. Against the hopes of authorities, however, there is little evidence that transparency alone can reduce vaccine skepticism, unless this transparency discloses a highly safe and effective vaccine. Additional analyses suggest that this reflects that vaccine skepticism is not grounded in psychological uncertainty but in deep distrust of authorities, which impedes the effectiveness of their communication.",Michael Bang Petersen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46193-973-263,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46193-973-263,2020-11-28,2020-11-29T02:34:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; conspiracy; covid-19; vaccine; transparency,False
222,Assessing Self-Other Distinctions Through Decision-making Under Risk in The Era of Covid-19,"The current Covid-19 pandemic has demanded a degree of sacrifice from individuals for the sake of the greater good. Individuals have taken costly actions, both volitional and imposed, to reduce harm to strangers. The pandemic oers a unique opportunity to examine a fundamental question: where does the distinction between self and other lie? This question can be framed as a moral dilemma between competing motives of self-serving and pro-social behavior. Given the multifaceted uncer- tainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, we propose to assess self-other distinction using models of decision-making under risk. We administered two surveys, where participants selected between sure and risky treatments for fictitious diseases, for themselves, a loved one and a stranger. Choice of treatment option showed risk-seeking tendencies that decreased with expected disease severity, across all targets, suggesting risk preferences for the other parallel those for the self. However, distinctions across targets emerged when decisions were conditioned on treatment cost, with sure treatments cho- sen more often for self and a close other; and sure treatment assigned a higher price for diseases with low expected severity, for self and other. These findings inform on what constitutes a measure of self-other distinction; and the limits of what can be asked of an individual in service to a stranger.",Leyla Loued-Khenissi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-DA1-4AD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-DA1-4AD,2020-11-27,2020-11-28T14:50:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Behavioral Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; risk; covid-19 pandemic; self-other distinction; decision-making,False
223,Are COVID-19 conspiracies a threat to public health? Psychological characteristics and health protective behaviours of believers,"The fast-changing COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to many conspiracy theories, and these have the potential to undermine public health measures and safeguarding behaviours. We conducted three studies before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 302, 404 and 399) to (i) identify the prevalence of COVID-19 conspiracy theories in the UK, (ii) map their socio-psychological predictors, and (iii) investigate their association with health safeguarding behaviours. We found COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were prevalent (25% of participants endorsed at least one) and predicted by beliefs in unrelated conspiracies, a conspiracy mind-set, distrust in governmental authorities, education, and cognitive reflection. Unexpectedly, COVID-19 conspiracy believers adhered to basic health guidelines both before and after the lockdown as strictly as non-believers (e.g., washing hands, social distancing) and adopted more advanced health protective behaviours not (yet) officially recommended in the UK (e.g., wearing a mask, washing groceries with soap). Conspiracy believers were also more reluctant to install the contact-tracing app, get tested for and vaccinated against COVID-19 because of the perceived risks associated with these procedures.

Online questionnaires were completed by 504 parents of young people with SENDs at four time points between 23rd March 2020 and 22nd October 2020 (over half completed the questionnaire at multiple time points). Young people with SENDs were more likely to be picked on or hurt by their siblings as lockdown progressed but there was no change in the rate at which they harmed or picked on their siblings.

Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being and using actively or passively various SNSs (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. Eight hundred and twenty-three persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures. Analyzes employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affects through social support. However, TikTok use was not associated with well-being and the only significant relation for Twitter was between active usage and lower satisfaction with life.

227,Pandemic leadership: Sex differences and their evolutionary–developmental origins,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global societal, economic, and social upheaval unseen in living memory. There have been substantial differences in the kinds of policies implemented by political decision-makers to prevent the spread of the virus, to test the population, and to manage infected patients. Among other factors, these policies vary with politicians’ sex: early findings indicate that, on average, female leaders seem more focused on minimizing direct human suffering caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while male leaders implement riskier short-term decisions, possibly aiming to minimize economic disruptions. These sex differences are consistent with broader findings in psychology, reflecting women’s stronger empathy, higher pathogen disgust, health concern, care-taking orientation, and dislike for the suffering of other people—as well as men’s higher risk-taking, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and focus on financial indicators of success and status. This review article contextualizes sex differences in pandemic leadership in an evolutionary framework. Evolution by natural selection is the only known process in nature that organizes populations of organisms into higher degrees of functional order, or counteracts the unavoidable disorder that would otherwise ensue, and is therefore essential for explaining the origins of human sex differences. Differential sexual selection and parental investment between males and females, together with the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, drive sex differences in cognition and behavioral dispositions, underlying men’s and women’s leadership styles and decision-making during a global pandemic. We propose the sexually dimorphic leadership specialization hypothesis to explain how general psychobehavioral sex differences have been exapted during human evolution to create sexually dimorphic leadership styles. They may be facultatively co-opted by societies when facing different kinds of ecological and/or sociopolitical threats, such as disease outbreaks or intergroup aggression. Early evidence indicates that against the invisible viral foe that can bring nations to their knees, the strategic circumspection of empathic feminine health “worriers” may bring more effective and humanitarian outcomes than the devil-may-care incaution of masculine risk-taking “warriors”.",Severi Luoto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-253-C9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-253-C9D,2020-11-26,2020-11-27T03:52:18+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; cognition; pandemic; population health; evolution; sexually dimorphic leadership specialization; leadership; sex differences; covid-19",False

229,Improving preventive health behaviors in the COVID-19 crisis: a messaging intervention in a large nationally representative sample,"Public health communication play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. We used five well-established psychological levers to improve on the efficacy of two posters used by the French authorities (one on protective behaviors and one on proper handwashing). The five levers were: simplification (streamlining the posters), sunk costs (emphasizing the costs already paid to fight the pandemic), morality (emphasizing the duty to help others), self-protection (emphasizing the personal risks), and disgust (pointing out and illustrating that not following the protective behaviors or proper handwashing had consequences that should trigger disgust). We tested on a large (N = 3000) nationally representative French sample whether versions of the posters using these levers, compared to a control condition, were clearer, better recalled, and increased people’s intention to follow the posters’ recommendations. On the whole, there were no effects of the manipulations on any of the measures. The only consistent pattern was that the control protective behavior poster was better recalled than the alternatives (except for the simplified version), possibly because it contained one fewer message. The lack of effect on behavioral intentions might be attributed to the potential saturation in terms of health communication at the time of the experiment.

The review shows that a combination of variables shaped compliance behaviour, including people’s fear of the virus, psychosocial factors (including impulsivity, negative emotions, self-efficacy, and social norms), institutional variables (including attitudes towards the mitigation measures, belief in conspiracy theories and knowledge of the virus), and situational variables (capacity to obey and opportunity to violate the rules). Notably, the reviewed studies did not find a significant association between law enforcement (perceived deterrence) and compliance here. The review assesses what these findings mean for behavioural theory and for policy makers seeking to mitigate pandemics like COVID-19. Also, it reflects on the limitations of the reviewed body of work and future directions for pandemic compliance research.",Emmeke Barbara Kooistra et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DB-72F-111,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DB-72F-111,2020-11-26,2020-11-26T16:24:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; social distancing; covid-19; systematic review; compliance; public health,False
231,Sexist Attitudes and Family Aggression during COVID-19 Lockdown,"The current research examined whether men’s hostile sexism was a risk factor for family-based aggression during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in which families were confined to the home for 5 weeks. Parents who had reported on their sexist attitudes and aggressive behavior toward intimate partners and children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic completed assessments of aggressive behavior toward their partners and children during the lockdown (N = 362 parents of which 310 were drawn from the same family). Accounting for pre-lockdown levels of aggression, men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism reported greater aggressive behavior toward their intimate partners and their children during the lockdown. The contextual factors that help explain these longitudinal associations differed across targets of family-based aggression. Men’s hostile sexism predicted greater aggression toward intimate partners when men experienced low power during couples’ interactions, whereas men’s hostile sexism predicted greater aggressive parenting when men reported lower partner-child relationship quality. Novel effects also emerged for benevolent sexism. Men’s higher benevolent sexism predicted lower aggressive parenting, and women’s higher benevolent sexism predicted greater aggressive behavior toward partners, irrespective of power and relationship quality. The current study provides the first longitudinal demonstration that men’s hostile sexism predicts residual changes in aggression toward both intimate partners and children. Such aggressive behavior will intensify the health, well-being, and developmental costs of the pandemic, highlighting the importance of targeting power-related gender role beliefs when screening for aggression risk and delivering therapeutic and education interventions as families face the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19.",Nickola Overall,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A6-553-C75,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A6-553-C75,2020-11-25,2020-11-26T16:15:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; power; covid-19 lockdown; hostile sexism; intimate partner aggression; aggressive parenting,False
232,The Italian Covid-19 Psychological Research Consortium ( IT C19PRC): General Overview and Replication of the UK study,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic represents a major stressor for the psychological health of people worldwide. In the UK, the Covid19-Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC) launched to evaluate the psychological impact of Covid-19 in the general population and its implications. The project was then extended to Italy and several other countries. Purpose: this article provides an overview of the Italian C19PRC study and its replication of two specific findings from the UK C19PRC. In the first part, the relationship between anxiety and somatic symptomatology is examined. In the second part, we analyse the association between several factors and psychological health outcomes: depression/anxiety, traumatic stress, Covid-19 anxiety. Methods: in line with the study conducted in the UK, an online survey was administered to the adult Italian general population. The sample included 1038 respondents (age, mean = 49.94, SD = 16.14; 51.15% females) taken from four regions: Lombardia, Veneto, Lazio e Campania. The relationship between predictors and outcomes was evaluated by means of logistic regression models. Results: somatic indices showed a positive association with anxiety, worse somatic symptoms were associated with having had losses due to Covid-19 and with precarious health conditions. Females showed a higher incidence of psychological issues. No differences in anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress were found across regions but the Campania region showed the most severe somatic symptomatology. In the second analysis, the factors associated with more severe psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety and/or depression, traumatic stress, and Covid-19 Related Anxiety) were younger age, the presence of minors in the household, traumatic stressors, and precarious health conditions. No differences across regions emerged. Discussions and conclusions: The Italian results correspond to the UK findings for anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress 1. Both in the UK and Italy, the factors associated with worse psychological health were gender (female), younger age, having children, pre-existing health issues (both for oneself or someone close), and the moderate/high perceived risk of contracting Covid-19 within one month. In Italy, unlike the UK, lower household income and having (had) Covid-19 were not associated with poorer mental health. The psychological impact of Covid-19 can last for months; future research should explore all aspects of the psychological burden of Covid-19 in order to implement psychological interventions and promote psychological health.",Giovanni Bruno et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-2B7-75F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-2B7-75F,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T18:48:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences,False
233,"Planning for a COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign: The Role of Social Norms, Trust, Knowledge, and Vaccine Attitudes","Building public trust and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is as important as developing a safe and effective vaccine to contain the pandemic. Based on the theory of normative social behavior, trust, and the theory of planned behavior, this study tests a comprehensive model for COVID-19 vaccine intentions using a national sample survey of the New Zealand public (N=1040). Among the factors assessed in the study, attitudes towards vaccine was most strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions, followed by trust in mass media, and social norms. While COVID-19 knowledge was associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention, it was not associated with willingness to pay or get on a COVID-19 vaccine list. In contrast, communication competence was not associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention but was significantly associated with willingness to pay or get on a COVID-19 vaccine list.

234,Adolescent Behavioral Health Problems are Associated with Parent Perceptions of Evidence-Based Therapy and Preferences when Seeking Therapeutic Support,"Informational materials from psychological associations often encourage parents to seek out “evidence-based therapies” (EBTs) to address their child’s behavioral health concerns. This study examined whether parents concerned about their adolescents’ substance use had distinct preferences for EBT principles and marketing language based on their adolescent’s specific behavioral health problems. Parents (N = 411; 86% female; 88% non-Hispanic White) of adolescents (age 12-19 years) completed an online direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing survey as part of a larger multi-phase study. Parents reported their adolescents had high rates of current externalizing (66%), internalizing (51%), substance-related (39%), and legal (25%) problems. Parents answered questions about their perceived definition of EBT, whether they valued underlying EBT principles (i.e., reliance on a proven approach vs. a varied approach), their preferred terms for describing EBT, and factors they considered when choosing a therapist. Most parents defined EBT correctly, regardless of their adolescent’s behavioral health problems. Parents of adolescents with internalizing or legal problems were less likely to value EBT principles, with legal problems emerging as the more important multivariate predictor. Additionally, parents of adolescents with substance-related or legal problems had distinct preferences for the terms used to describe EBTs. Finally, parents of adolescents with externalizing problems had distinct preferences for factors they considered when choosing a therapist. Psychologists and psychological associations seeking to disseminate information about EBTs to parents can utilize these DTC marketing-informed results to tailor outreach strategies based on adolescent behavioral health problems.",Margaret Ellen Crane et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46094-EB2-199,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46094-EB2-199,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T18:25:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; mental health; direct-to-consumer marketing; adolescent; substance use,False
235,Validation to Spanish version of the COVID-19 Stress Scale,"There is a global consensus about the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to affect people's mental health. In this context, and prior to the formulation of mitigation strategies, tools are required that allow an objective and effective assessment of mental health risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of COVID-19 Stress Scale, formulated by Taylor et al. (2020), based on the concept of COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. A national sample of 1214 participating adults was taken in Colombia, who answered a translated version of the scale. Evidence of a hexa-dimensional structure was obtained whose goodness of fit indicators were Chi2 = 1215,759, Sig. =. 000, CMIN / DF = 2.202, RMSEA = .044, NFI = .943, TLI = .964, CFI =. 968 and FMIN = 1,967. Regarding reliability, an α = .924 and Spearman-Brown = .824 were obtained for the entire scale; the reliability indicators of the 6 subscales were also high.

236,"Lived experience related to the COVID-19 pandemic among Arabic-, Russian- and Somali-speaking migrants in Finland","Increasing research shows that migrants are disproportionally exposed to COVID-19 disease. However, little is known about their lived experience and related meaning-making. This qualitative study maps COVID-19-related experiences among respondents from three migrant groups living in Finland: Somali-, Arabic- and Russian-speakers (N = 209). The data was collected by telephone interviews over four weeks in March and April 2020. Using inductive thematical analysis, we identified seven themes that illustrate respondents’ multifaceted lived experiences during the first phase of pandemic. The themes depict respondents’ difficulties and fears, but also their resilience and resources to cope, both individually and collectively. Experiences varied greatly between individuals and migrant groups. The main conclusion is that although the COVID-19 pandemic may be an especially stressful experience for migrant populations, it may also provide opportunities to deepen cooperation and trust within migrant communities, and between migrants and their country of settlement. Our analysis suggests that cooperation between local authorities and migrants, trust-building and effective information-sharing can foster positive and functional adaptations to disease-related threats and changing social environments.",Eerika Finell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46106-4A9-4DE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46106-4A9-4DE,2020-11-24,2020-11-25T17:23:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; pandemic; disease-related threats; migrants; covid-19; health; experiences,False
237,"""No way out except from external intervention"": First-hand accounts of autistic inertia","This study, called for by autistic people and led by an autistic researcher, is the first to explore ‘autistic inertia’, a widespread and often debilitating difficulty initiating action. Previous research has considered initiation only in the context of social interaction or experimental conditions. This study is unique in considering difficulty initiating tasks of any type in real life settings, and by gathering qualitative data directly from autistic people. Four face-to-face and 2 online (text) focus groups were conducted with 32 autistic adults (19 female, 8 male, 5 other), aged 23-64 who were able to express their internal experiences in words. They articulate in detail the actions they have difficulty with, what makes it easier or harder to act, and the impact on their lives. Thematic analysis of the transcripts found four overarching themes: descriptions of inertia, scaffolding to support action, the influence of wellbeing, and the impact on day-to-day activities. Participants described difficulty starting, stopping and changing activities that was not within their conscious control. While difficulty with planning was common, a subset of participants described a profound impairment in initiating even simple actions more suggestive of a movement disorder. Prompting and compatible activity in the environment promoted action, while mental health difficulties and stress exacerbated difficulties. Inertia had pervasive effects on participants’ day-to-day activities and wellbeing. This overdue research opens the door to many areas of further investigation to better understand autistic inertia and effective support strategies.",Karen Leneh Buckle et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-EFF-E43,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-EFF-E43,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T17:20:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Neuropsychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; asd; initiation; movement; catatonia; inertia; autism; autistic adults; qualitative,False
238,Anxious and Angry: Emotional and Political Motives for Approving of and Complying with Hygiene Measures related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic elicits a vast amount of collective anxiety, which may also have broader societal and political implications. In the current study, we investigate the individual and social impact of this anxiety. We conducted an online survey in four different countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK; N=2031), examining whether anxiety about the Coronavirus leads to more approval of and compliance with hygiene measures deployed in those countries, and what role political beliefs play at this. We found significant differences between the four countries, with Spain marking highest anxiety as well as approval of and compliance with hygiene measures. Furthermore, three linear regressions showed that one’s anxiety is not only predicted by proximity to sources of infection (age, country, oneself or friends being infected), but also by political views (populist attitudes, anger at the government). Importantly, people who are anxious are also angry, at transgressors of hygiene rules or at their government. Thus, anger does not reduce one’s fear, but fear leads to more anger, especially in countries with the highest infection rates. Anxiety also leads to more approval of and compliance with hygiene measures, but again anger and political beliefs play a role in this relation. Whereas behavioral compliance is more predicted by fear and anger at others who transgress the rules, approval of the measures is better predicted by anxiety about the impact of Coronavirus and anger at the government.",David Abadi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-5DD-928,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-5DD-928,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T17:19:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression; conspiracy mentality; anxiety; emotions; covid-19; populism; anger,False
239,Prosocial behaviours under collective quarantine conditions. A latent class analysis study during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Italy,"Aim. To identify patterns of prosocial behaviours under collective quarantine conditions. Method. Survey data was collected from a sample of Italian adults during the March ̶ May 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Participants reported on offline and online prosocial behaviours, Sense of Community Responsibility (SoC-R) and perceptions of community resilience. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used for data analysis. Results. A total of 4,045 participants completed the survey and 2,562 were eligible (72% female; mean age 38.7 years). LCA revealed four classes of prosocial behaviours: Money donors (7%), Online & offline helpers (59%), Online health information sharers (21%), and Neighbour helpers (13%). The classes were partially invariant across age groups (18 ̶ 35 and > 35 years). Being a man and higher SoC-R scores were associated with belonging to the Online & offline helper class. Members of this class also reported the greatest perceptions of community resilience. Conclusions.

240,The Impact of School Closure and Social Isolation on Children in Vulnerable Families during COVID-19: A Focus on Children’s Reactions,"The COVID-19 public health measures may have long-term consequences for children into adulthood. By exploring children’s reactions more broadly, including both positive and negative reactions, we are better placed to understanding the breadth of implications of home school and social isolation under COVID-19. The present study explored how COVID-19 related variables including home school experience, family stress and instability, screen time use, missing friends and worry about virus infection are associated with children’s emotional, somatic/cognitive and worry reactions, respectively. Data were drawn from the longitudinal [study name blinded for peer review]-study and a series of hierarchical linear regression models were applied controlling for children’s gender, age and psychological vulnerability. Results showed significant associations between all three outcomes and all COVID-19 related predictors, except for screen time use. Further, age moderated several of these associations and older children were more negatively impacted (i.e., higher level of reported reactions). The present study provides more conclusive evidence of the effects of home school and social isolation under COVID-19 on children’s. It also exemplifies the importance of focusing on the children’s reactions more broadly, as there was evidence that children had fewer emotional reactions compared to before the pandemic.",Linda Larsen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F9-00C-5ED,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F9-00C-5ED,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T07:58:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; home school; missing friends; covid-19; family stress; screen time use; covid-19 worries; social isolation; child reactions,False
241,"Regional Personality Differences Predict Variation in COVID-19 Infections, Deaths and Social Distancing Behavior","Social and compliance behaviors play a critical role in the transmission of COVID-19. Consequently, regional variation in personality traits that capture individual differences in these behaviors may offer new insight into the spread of COVID-19. We combine self-reported personality data (3.5M people), COVID-19 prevalence and death rates, and behavioral mobility observations (29M people) to show that regional personality differences in the US and Germany predict COVID-19-related outcomes and behaviors incremental to a conservative set of socio-demographic, economic, and pandemic-related control variables. Earlier onsets of COVID-19 and steeper initial growth rates were related to higher levels of Openness and lower levels of Neuroticism. We also show that (i) regional personality is associated with objective indicators of social distancing, (ii) the effects of regional personality can change over time (Openness), and that (iii) the effects of regional personality do not always converge with those observed at the individual level (Agreeableness and Conscientiousness).",Heinrich Peters et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-F45-EB8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-F45-EB8,2020-08-06,2020-11-24T01:11:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; social distancing; regional personality; covid-19; big five,False
242,Stay at Home! When Personality Profiles Influence Psychological Adjustment and Creativity during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to “stay at home”. Although research suggests that social isolation affects health and wellbeing, reactions may vary depending on individuals, and their preference for solitude. This study aimed to identify personality profiles, and examine whether these profiles were associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. French respondents (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in Spring 2020. The questionnaire comprised information on lockdown conditions, measures of psychological adjustment and performance on a series of creative tasks. Based on measures of individuals’ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, the cluster analysis revealed three profiles: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with “Affiliation” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a creative insight task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns. With this knowledge, health professionals could develop appropriate interventions to accompany high-risk individuals in situations of social isolation.",Estelle Michinov et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,2020-06-22,2020-11-23T13:29:36+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; personality profiles; social isolation; covid-19; creativity; preference for solitude,False

However, theories of pandemic distress mitigation remain untested. Here, we compare longitudinal responses from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), March 26th to April 12th, 2020 (lockdown), with participants’ pre-COVID-19 baselines from the previous year (N=940) to investigate pandemic distress mechanisms during New Zealand's first stringent national lockdown.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-E43-30B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-E43-30B,2020-11-23,2020-11-23T12:26:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; anxiety; lockdown; well being; longitudinal; employment; stan; bayesian; kessler-6; alert level-4,False
244,Families face pandemic – A review of psychological suggestions and empirical findings regarding the Covid-19 pandemic,"Aims. Even though child psychology researches related to a pandemic are extensive, the knowledge of practitioners about interventions and practices is still very limited. The complete novelty of such an epidemic situation in Europe, the diversity of terminology and methods are factors that make results hard to interpret. Therefore, the current study aims to give an overview of the psychological literature of the family aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods. A search was executed in four databases (Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar) using the following keywords: pandemic, Covid 19, family, children, adolescents, anxiety, depression. Our review focuses only on English language literature. Results. The majority of the articles focus on non-pathological phenomena and draws attention to the behavior of healthy populations (increase in internet use, the decline of concentration). Methods were dominated by online surveys. These surveys were mainly constructed ad-hoc and they preferred to address parents. Direct child investigations are underrepresented, but several suggestions were formulated for their optimal functioning. Conclusion:. Researches focusing on psychopathology emphasize the growth in the prevalence of disorders. However, other researches are needed to explore the psychodynamics of the pandemic on the family level.

This paper describes the execution of the third wave of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during July-August 2020. Methods: Adults (N=2025) who previously participated in the baseline and/or the first follow-up surveys were reinvited to participate in this survey, which assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders; as well as the role of (3) psychological factors and (4) social and political attitudes, in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure that the cross-sectional sample is nationally representative in terms of gender, age, household income, household composition, and urbanicity. Results: 1166 adults (57.6% of baseline participants) were successfully recontacted and provided full interviews at Wave 3. As expected, the raking procedure successfully re-balanced the cross-sectional sample to within 1% of population estimates across the selected socio-demographic characteristics.

246,Caring for Coronavirus Healthcare Workers: Lessons Learned from Long-Term Monitoring of Military Peacekeepers,"Background: The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is of unprecedented proportions in several regards. Recent reports suggest that many frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) suffer from mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Previous studies have identified several key factors associated with short-term PTSS in pandemic HCWs, yet limited data is available on factors associated with long-term PTSS. Understanding the psychological impact of the pandemic on healthcare workers, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. In the current study, we look to findings from a highly relevant subsection of the trauma field, the military domain. Objective: Pandemic HCWs and military peacekeepers may experience similar stressors in the line of duty. This study investigated whether factors linked to short-term PTSS in pandemic HCWs were also associated with long-term PTSS in military peacekeepers. Materials and Methods: Peacekeepers who reported pandemic-relevant stressors during deployment to a UN peacekeeping mission were included in the study (N = 1,627). PTSS was self-reported using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Military Version. Descriptive instruments were used to assess possible factors associated with PTSS. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between these factors and PTSS. Results: Our model accounted for 50% of the variance in PTSS, F(1503,11) = 139.00, p < .001. Age, relationship- and employment status, as well as preparedness, working environment, social support after deployment, barriers to disclose, recognition, and loneliness, were all significantly associated with PTSS on average 30 years after deployment. The most important risk factors of long-term PTSS were personal barriers to disclose one’s experiences and current unemployment. Conclusions: Several factors linked to short-term PTSS in pandemic HCWs were associated with long-term PTSS in peacekeepers. We discuss how these findings may be used to prevent long-term PTSS in HCWs involved in the current COVID-19 outbreak.",Christer Lunde Gjerstad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-54B-D37,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-54B-D37,2020-06-10,2020-11-23T10:03:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; resilience (psychologhical); ptsd - posttraumatic stress disorder; military; health care workers (hcw); covid-19; mental health,False
247,Examining temporal interactions between loneliness and depressive symptoms and the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties among UK residents during the COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal results from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study,"Background Longitudinal studies examining the temporal association between mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak are needed. It is important to determine how relationships between mental health outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. Method Data was gathered over 4 months (March – June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson’s product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. Results The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. Limitations Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both. Potential approaches include increasing physical activity or low-intensity cognitive therapies delivered remotely.",Jenny Groarke et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460ED-01F-78B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460ED-01F-78B,2020-11-20,2020-11-22T01:10:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; mental health; united kingdom; depression; longitudinal studies; emotional regulation; loneliness; covid-19,False
248,"Age Advantages of Emotional Experience during the COVID-19 Pandemic are Robust, but Diminished Compared to Pre-pandemic Conditions","Getting old is generally seen as unappealing, yet aging confers considerable advantages in several psychological domains (North & Fiske, 2015). In particular, older adults are better off emotionally than younger adults, with aging associated with the so-called “age advantages,” that is, more positive and less negative emotional experiences (Carstensen et al., 2011). Although the age advantages are well established, it is less clear whether they occur under conditions of prolonged stress. In a recent study, Carstensen et al (2020) demonstrated that the age advantages persist during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that older adults are able to utilise cognitive and behavioural strategies to ameliorate even sustained stress. Here, we build on Carstensen and colleagues’ work with two studies. In Study 1, we provide a large-scale test of the robustness of Carstensen and colleagues’ finding that older individuals experience more positive and less negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured positive and negative emotions along with age information in 23,629 participants in 63 countries in April-May 2020. In Study 2, we provide a comparison of the age advantages using representative samples collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate that older people experience less negative emotion than younger people during the prolonged stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the advantage of older adults was diminished during the pandemic, pointing to a likely role of older adults use of situation selection strategies (Charles, 2010).",Rui Sun et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46017-FB3-577,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46017-FB3-577,2020-11-19,2020-11-20T16:48:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion,False
249,Infection control in the home: A qualitative study exploring perceptions and experiences of adhering to protective behaviours in the household during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Recommended behaviours to protect from COVID-19 in the home include cleaning, handwashing, social distancing, spending time in your own room and wearing a face-covering in close proximity to people. Evidence is accumulating that following these behaviours can help protect against COVID-19, but adherence is mixed. This study sought to understand people’s perceptions of following these protective behaviours in the home to inform the adaptation of an online infection control intervention: Germ Defence. Methods: Thirteen participants were interviewed by telephone about their perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and their experiences of protecting themselves at home. Members of the public were purposively sampled via the Germ Defence website from a database of 971 volunteers, and from social media to complete thinkaloud interviews about their perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and their experiences of protecting themselves at home. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Open-ended qualitative survey data from 124 participants sampled from the Germ Defence database were categorised inductively and mapped onto the themes in order to supplement the interview data. Results: Thematic analysis generated 7 major themes; perceived risk, belief in the efficacy of protective behaviours, acceptability of the behaviours, having capacity to perform the behaviours, the perceived effort involved, having the confidence to perform the behaviours, and social norms affect motivation to engage in the behaviours. The survey data mapped well onto these themes, strengthening the concepts generated through the interviews. Cleaning and handwashing were widely perceived to be effective and acceptable, although some participants described how other members of their household were less adherent to these behaviours which could cause anxiety. Behaviours such as spending time in separate rooms at home and social distancing were often seen as less acceptable, especially when no-one in the household has any symptoms. However, people were also aware that only putting these behaviours into practice once symptoms had developed would likely mean the virus had already spread within the home, which made them feel powerless or confused. Discussion: People felt more empowered when they understood that even small changes, such as spending some time apart, were worthwhile in order to reduce exposure and lessen viral load.",Katherine Morton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-42A-3EB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-42A-3EB,2020-09-02,2020-11-20T15:48:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; self-isolation; covid-19; infection control; perceptions; social distancing; qualitative,False
