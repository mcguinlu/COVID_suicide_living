0,Working Paper: Application of automatic sentiment analysis: The role of emotions in an experimental learning intervention,"This secondary-analysis register report aims at testing the role of emotion in the intervention effect of an experimental intervention study in academic settings. Previous analyses of the National Study of the Learning Mindset (Yeager et al., 2019) showed that in a randomized controlled trial, high school students who were given the growth mindset intervention had, on average higher GPA than did students in the control condition. Previous analyses also showed that school achievement levels moderated the intervention effect. This study further explores whether the emotion students experienced during the growth mindset intervention plays a role in the intervention effect. Specifically, using a sentence-level automated text analysis for emotional valence (i.e. sentiment analysis), students’ written reflections during the intervention are analyzed. Linear mixed models are conducted to test if valence reflected in the written texts predicted higher intervention effect (i.e. higher post-intervention GPA given pre-intervention GPA). The moderating role of school achievement levels was also examined. A 10% random sample of the data was analyzed as a pilot study for this registered report to test for feasibility and proof-of-concept. Results of the pilot data showed small, yet significant relations between emotional valence and intervention effects. The results of this study have implications on the role of emotion in the results of intervention or experimental studies, especially those that are conducted in academic settings. This study also introduces a user-friendly text-based analytic method for experimental psychologists to detect and analyze sentence-level emotional valence in an intervention or experimental study.",Manyu Li,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-5F2-5C7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-5F2-5C7,2020-08-01,2020-08-01T21:00:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation,False
1,The Role of Trust and Information in Adherence to Protective Behaviors & Conspiracy Thinking during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Infodemic_preprint,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, and in order to halt it, the spread of the virus needs to be curbed. The World Health Organization and governments have put forward protective guidelines to stop the spread, but adherence to these guidelines is still variable. Through a large survey in twelve countries worldwide (N = 7,755), we show that the information about COVID-19 which is accurate and trustworthy is paramount for the adherence to protective guidelines. Specifically, adherence to safety precautions is predicted by concern, gender, perceived risk, perceived knowledge, and trust in scientists. Adherence to the guidelines was also predicted by distrust in the government and the conspiracy belief that the virus is artificially made; conspiracy thinking predicted self-centered protective behaviors more strongly than safety precautions, however. Conspiracy thinking was predicted by trust in social media, whereas perceived knowledge was associated with trust in reliable COVID-19 websites.",Valerie Van Mulukom,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-C7E-7A4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-C7E-7A4,2020-08-01,2020-08-01T19:31:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; prevention guidelines; covid-19; covid-19 guidelines; health behaviors; information; adherence; safety precautions; compliance; coronavirus; conspiracy beliefs; trust in government; trust in science,False
2,Resilience contributes to low emotional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in Italy,"Background The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences. The Italian Government has implemented a massive lockdown to decrease the spread of the virus. Although a strong psychological impact is possible, few evidences are still available. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress promoting mental health. For these reasons, this study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterizing by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. Methods A total sample of 6314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 10 and May 4 2020 through an online survey, the majority of whom from Northern Italy. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) (a measure of mental health status) and the Resilience Scale (RS) (a measure of resilience) were administered. Also, demographic data and lockdown related information were collected. DASS-21 cut-off scores were used to verify the mental status among the participants. Subsequently, a correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between DASS-21 and RS. Lastly, three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the three DASS-21 scales as dependent variables and the RS scales as independent variables controlling for age, gender, and education. Results The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 36.1% for depression, 28.7% for anxiety, and 35.6% for stress. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that all the resilience factors were statistically significant in predicting anxiety, while meaningfulness, perseverance, existential aloneness, and equanimity predicted depression and stress. Conclusions During the lockdown following the COVID-19 outbreak, about a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychological interventions to enhance resilience might provide useful approaches to overcome COVID-related emotional impact.",Vittorio Lenzo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-344-7DB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-344-7DB,2020-08-01,2020-08-01T06:15:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; clinical psychology; depression; dass-21; resilience; anxiety; covid-19; stress; resilience scale,False
3,"Culture, COVID-19, and Collectivism: A Paradox of American Exceptionalism?","We examined archival data from 98 countries (Study 1) and the 48 contiguous United States (Study 2) on country/state-level collectivism, COVID-19 case/death rates, relevant covariates (per-capita GDP, population density, spatial dependence), and in the U.S., percent of non-Whites. In Study 1, country-level collectivism negatively related to both cases (r = -.28) and deaths (r = -.40) in simple regressions; however, after controlling for covariates, the former became non-significant (rp = -.07), but the later remained significant (rp = -.20). In Study 2, state-level collectivism positively related to both cases (r = .56) and deaths (r = .41) in simple regressions, and these relationships persisted after controlling for all covariates except race, where a state’s non-White population dominated all other predictors of COVID-19 cases (rp = .35) and deaths (rp = .31).

4,County-level recruitment in online samples: Applications to COVID-19 and beyond,"Thousands of readily downloadable county-level data sets offer untapped potential for linking geo-social influences to individual-level human behavior. In this study we describe a methodology for county-level sampling of online participants, allowing us to link the self-reported behavior of N = 1084 online respondents to contemporaneous county-level data on COVID-19 infection rate density. Using this approach, we show that infection rate density predicts person-level self-reported face mask wearing beyond multiple other demographic and attitudinal covariates.

5,COnVida-20(1),"An increasing number of studies have addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in the general population. Nevertheless, far less is known about the impact in specific populations such as university students, whose psychological vulnerability has been shown in previous research. This study sought to examine different indicators of mental health in university students during the Spanish lockdown; we also analyzed the main sources of stress perceived by students in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, and the coping strategies adopted when faced with the situation. Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact; and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially channeled the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that students’ psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress. This study reinforces the need to monitor and promote mental health in university students to boost resilience in times of crisis. Our results on effective coping strategies may inform preventive programs aimed at helping students to deal with challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.",Isabel Padrón et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-A5C-11A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-A5C-11A,2020-07-31,2020-07-31T17:24:51+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; psychological impact; coping; stressors; university students; convida-20.,False
6,"Measuring COVID-19 Fear in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity. Differences in the performance of the Fear of Infection and Existential Threat scales are considered in terms of the respective objective and subjective nature of the constructs.",Francesca Eileen Collins,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C,2020-07-06,2020-07-31T11:47:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; international students; australia; nepal; india; australian; university students; mental health; covid-19; contagion-related fear; scale validation; covid-19-related fear; nepali; fear; indian,False
7,What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger: Sense of coherence moderates growth from stress amidst the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak,"Purpose This study explored the role of perceived severity of the pandemic, post-traumatic stress and sense of coherence in the development of post-traumatic growth from exposure to COVID-19 among Hong Kong citizens. Methods A longitudinal online survey was launched during the first local outbreak in Spring 2020. Time 1 was collected at the peak of the outbreak (Mid-March to early-April) with measurements of post-traumatic stress, perceived severity, and sense of coherence; while Time 2 was conducted at the palliation of the outbreak (late-April to early May) with post-traumatic growth measured. Moderated mediation models were tested with SPSS PROCESS version 3.30. Results Among the 327 participants who completed both T1 and T2 questionnaires, 28.4% exhibited probable post-traumatic stress disorder, while 18.0% experienced significant post-traumatic growth in at least one domain. Post-traumatic growth was more likely among people with higher socio-economic backgrounds and with family or close friends having experienced medical quarantine or being tested positive for SAR-CoV-2. The interaction between sense of coherence and post-traumatic stress significantly mediated the link relationship of perceived severity on post-traumatic growth, such that growth was more likely among participants with higher post-traumatic stress and sense of coherence. Conclusion Echoing with the transformational model, our findings highlight the importance of traumatic stress and adaptive coping resources in developing post-traumatic growth. Severe judgments of the novel and challenging pandemic could be conducive to growth, especially when the individuals possess high sense of coherence.",Bobo Hi Po Lau et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46222-AEA-DDA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46222-AEA-DDA,2020-07-31,2020-07-31T09:12:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; covid-19; post-traumatic growth; post-traumatic stress; perceived severity; mental health; sense of coherence; hong kong,False
8,Depression symptoms mediate mismatch between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and diminished compliance with prevention measures,"Without any known vaccine or cure, sustaining individuals’ cooperation in following prevention measures is crucial to prevent spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Here, we monitored national representative samples with changes in beliefs about the pandemic, depressive symptoms, and motivation to comply with prevention measures between the end of the first wave (Time1) and beginning of the second wave (Time2) of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Participants’ beliefs about the pandemic closely reflected the change of the COVID-19 situations. Strikingly, inconsistent with the accurate belief update, individuals regarded social distancing less important and externalized their motives to comply with preventive measures more at Time2 than Time1. This mismatch was mediated by depressive symptoms, such that increased depressive symptoms followed by negative belief change were associated with decreased perceived importance of social distancing and voluntary motivation. Our data highlights the importance of considering psychological reactions in promoting individuals’ compliance with prevention measures.",Jiwon Park et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974,2020-07-29,2020-07-30T18:06:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; depression; covid-19; belief; social distancing,False
9,Factors Mediating the Psychological Well-Being of Healthcare Workers Responding to Global Pandemics: A Systematic Review,"The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the likelihood of future pandemics has raised the attention to the effects of pandemics on the psychological well-being of individuals. Given their indispensable role in such situations, healthcare workers are at greater risk of mental health issues. This paper aimed to review the mediators of psychological well-being among healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. After registration on PROSPERO, a systematic review was performed in four databases. Following study selection (PRISMA guidelines), inclusion criteria and analysis methods were assessed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the EPHPP criteria. Out of 1467 references, 39 studies were included in this review. In most studies, worse well-being outcomes, such as stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout were related to demographic characteristics, direct contact with infected patients, and poor perceived support. In turn, self-efficacy, coping ability, altruism, and support from employers and organisations were found to be protective factors. Despite some limitations in the quality of the available evidence, this review highlights the prevalence of poor mental health outcomes in healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. Future interventions should target the identified mediators to promote psychological well-being among this population, particularly social and organisational support, which may improve workers’ mental health and reduce burnout and turnover.",Jekaterina Schneider et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-DBE-BD0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-DBE-BD0,2020-07-30,2020-07-30T17:35:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; healthcare professionals; mediation; pandemic; covid-19; mental health,False
10,Identification of socio-cognitive determinants of parental sun protection behaviors to optimize intervention development,"Background: Adequate sun safety during childhood is crucial for decreasing skin cancer risk in later life. Although parents are an essential target group in applying sun protection measures for their children, interventions are often not directed at parents. This study identifies the most relevant determinants in predicting parental sun protection intentions and behaviors to provide guidance for future intervention development. Methods: A longitudinal survey study with two measurements was conducted among Dutch parents (N=670) of children (4-12 years old). Twenty-seven socio-cognitive determinants were examined in terms of relevance regarding four parental sun protection behaviors in different sun exposure situations. The CIBER approach was used to visualize room for improvement (sample means) on all determinants and their association strengths (correlations) with sun protection intentions and behaviors. Results: Behavior-specific rather than generic determinants were most relevant in explaining all sun protection behaviors. Of these determinants, attitude, self-efficacy and action planning, and especially parental feelings of difficulty in performing sun protection behaviors, were most relevant. Altogether, the explained variance of all socio-cognitive determinants was highest for shade-seeking behavior (R2= .41 and .43) and lowest for supportive behavior (R2=.19 and .29) in both planned and incidental sun exposure situations respectively. Discussion: This study provides detailed insight into relevant socio-cognitive determinants of parental sun protection behaviors in various sun exposure situations. This insight provides guidance for composing parental skin cancer prevention interventions. Future composition of sun safety interventions should emphasize on enhancing parental feelings of self-efficacy, especially for shade-seeking and clothing behaviors.",Karlijn Thoonen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-161-6B8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-161-6B8,2020-07-30,2020-07-30T16:47:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; parent-to-child behavior; skin cancer prevention; sun protection behavior; understanding health behavior; health psychology; children's health,False
11,How communication technology helps mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individual and social wellbeing: Preliminary support for a compensatory social interaction model,"The present study preliminary tested the compensatory social interaction model for individuals experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. This original model comprises two distinct processes: expression of online emotions leads to post-traumatic growth, which can favor positive mental health and prosocial behaviors; and receiving online social support leads to increases in positive mental health, which can also favor prosocial behaviors. Adults living in Italy (n=1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed that being more involved in expression of online emotions was associated with higher post-traumatic growth that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, participants who perceived higher online social support were more likely to report higher positive mental health that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two social interaction processes suggest that communication technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the Covid-19 pandemic.",Natale Canale et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E,2020-07-30,2020-07-30T15:31:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
12,"Relationships between Nutrition and Physical Activity, and the Symptoms of Insomnia, Depression and Anxiety among Adolescents in South China During COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has caused mental health issues among adolescents. This study aimed to explore the related factors of nutrition, physical activity (PA), and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety, and to investigate associations between the two lifestyle behaviors (insolated or combined) with symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Cross-sectional data of 1,756 middle school students from a survey conducted in May 2020 was used. The t-tests or c2 tests were used to determine the related factors of nutrition, PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety across the subgroups when appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between nutrition and PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Girls, rural students, left-behind, sibling, students with low family income or excessive fear had worse lifestyle or mental status. Both poor nutrition and inactive PA were related to higher odds of reporting symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Students with both poor nutrition and inactive PA tended to report insomnia symptoms (OR = 2.16) and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.57) than those with only one behavior or neither of them after controlling for confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of helping adolescents to pursue a healthier lifestyle.",Xinli Chi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-373-450,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-373-450,2020-07-30,2020-07-30T14:40:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology,False
13,Perceived threat and acute anxiety predict increased everyday altruism during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Threatening situations have been shown to influence prosocial and altruistic behaviour in laboratory studies. However, it is unknown whether those effects would transfer to a real-life crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examined the impact of changing COVID-19 threat on everyday altruism. Specifically, we investigated the association between defensive emotions associated with varying levels of perceived threat imminence, and reported frequency of altruistic behaviours. A sample of 600 United States residents was recruited online via Prolific at 4 different timepoints in March and April (n=150 each week). We collected self-report measures of everyday altruism, Perceived COVID-19 threat, and defensive emotions associated with varying threat imminence (anticipatory versus acute anxiety). Linear mixed effects models were used to predict variation in everyday altruism as a function of perceived COVID-19 threat and defensive emotions. Our results revealed a clear and consistent association between acute anxiety in response to the pandemic, and frequency of altruistic behaviours. No significant association was found between altruism and less acute defensive responses. These results suggest acute defensive emotions associated with higher threat imminence may promote altruistic action during a real-life crisis.",Joana Vieira et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46226-5B0-718,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46226-5B0-718,2020-07-24,2020-07-30T13:46:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; threat; emotion; prosocial; altruism; defensive; covid-19,False
14,"Factors related to positive experiences in parent-child relationship during the COVID-19 lockdown. The role of empathy, emotion regulation, parenting self-efficacy and social support","Objective: Several researchers and clinicians have focused on the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for children and parents. However, we may suppose that some families may also experience positive aspects of the COVID-19 lockdown such as increased emotional closeness and more time for free play and creativity in parent-child relationships. The aim of the current study was to investigate predictors of the positive experiences in parent-child relationship in Polish mothers and fathers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: 228 mothers and 231 fathers completed the Brief version of the Empathic Sensitivity Questionnaire, The Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale Short Form, Social Support Scale, Parenting Self-Agency Measure, as well as The Scale of Positive Experiences in Parent-Child Relationship during the COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Our results show that parenting self-efficacy and social support are the best predictors of the positive experiences in parent-child relationships in both mothers and fathers during the lockdown. Additionally, perspective taking is a positive predictor of the positive experiences in mothers, whereas increased affective components of empathy (empathic concern and personal distress) are predictors of the positive experiences in the parent-child relationship in fathers. Conclusions: Our study emphasizes a need to focus not only on negative, but also on positive consequences of COVID-19 lockdown for children and parents, and shows which factors could be important targets for preventive and therapeutic interventions for mothers and fathers during the epidemic.",Małgorzata Gambin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A4-A7D-117,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A4-A7D-117,2020-07-30,2020-07-30T12:19:27+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being",False
15,Helplessness Among University Students: An Empirical Study Based on a Modified Framework of Implicit Personality Theories,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and within a very short period of time, teaching in the 2020 summer term changed from predominantly on-site to online instruction. Students suddenly faced having to adapt their learning process to new demands for which they may have had both insufficient digital skills and a lack of learning resources. Such a situation carries the risk that a substantial number of students become helpless. The aim of our empirical study was to test a hybrid framework of helplessness that includes both objective causes of helplessness and students' subjective interpretations of them. Before lectures or courses began, students of a full-scale university were invited to participate in an online survey. The final sample consists of 1,690 students.

16,Are Happier People More Compliant? Global Evidence From Three Large-Scale Surveys During Covid-19 Lockdowns,"Around the world, governments have been asking their citizens to substantially change their behaviour for a prolonged period of time, by practising physical distancing and staying at home, to contain the spread of Covid-19. Are happier people more willing to comply with these measures? Using three independent surveys covering about 119,000 adult respondents across 35 countries, including longitudinal data from the UK, we found that past and present happiness predicts compliance during lockdown. The relationship is stronger for those with higher levels of happiness. A negative mood, or loss in happiness, predicts lower compliance. We explored risk-avoidance and pro-social motivations for this relationship, and found that motivations for compliance are not uniformly distributed but dependent on personal characteristics and context: people who are older or have certain medical preconditions seem to be predominantly motivated by risk-avoidance, whereas motivations of people who are less at risk of Covid-19 seem more mixed.

17,Polygenic Risk Score for Smoking is associated with Externalizing Psychopathology and Disinhibited Personality Traits but not Internalizing Psychopathology in Adolescence,"Importance: Large consortia of genome wide association studies have yielded more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate the small effects of many genetic variants to characterize the genetic architecture of disorders and provide a personalized measure of genetic risk. Objective: We examined whether a PRS for smoking measured genetic risk for general behavioral disinhibition by estimating its associations with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and related personality traits. We examined these associations at multiple time points in adolescence using more refined phenotypes defined by stable characteristics across time and at young ages, which reduced potential confounds associated with cumulative exposure to substances and reverse causality. Methods: Random intercept panel models were fit to symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems and personality traits at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old in the Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 3225). Results: The smoking PRS had strong associations with the random intercept factors for all the externalizing measures (mean standardized ꞵ = .27), agreeableness (ꞵ=-.22, 95% CI: -.28, -.16), and conscientiousness (ꞵ=-.19, 95% CI: -.24, -.13), but was not significantly associated with the internalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .06) or extraversion (ꞵ=.01, 95% CI: -.05, .07). After controlling for smoking at age 17, the associations with the externalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .13) and personality traits related to behavioral control (mean ꞵ = -.10) remained statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The smoking PRS measures genetic influences that contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition including externalizing psychopathology and normal-range personality traits related to behavioral control, but not internalizing psychopathology. Continuing to identify the correlates and delineate the mechanisms of the genetic influences associated with disinhibition could have substantial impact in mitigating a variety of public health problems (e.g., mental health, academic achievement, criminality).",Brian M.

18,False-positive Effect in the Radin Double-slit Experiment: HARKing is used by Radin et al. to Misrepresent the Advanced Meta-experimental Protocol used in Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019),"Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019) reported (i) the absence of any true-positive effects and (ii) the presence of one false-positive effect in a commissioned replication study of the Radin double-slit (DS) experiment on observer consciousness. In their recent misrepresentation, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) regrettably used the malpractice of HARKing, i.e., undisclosed hypothesizing after the results are known. HARKing can increase greatly the risk of false-negative or false-positive conclusions. Specifically, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) deviated in two major ways from the pre-specified protocol for this commissioned study, which (i) was agreed to by Radin before data collection was started (Radin, 2011) and (ii) included data encryption to prevent the use of p-hacking and HARKing. First, Radin et al. (2019) violate the original research design by reporting a so-called “true-positive outcome of a secondary planned hypothesis”. Contrary to the claim by Radin et al. (2019, 2020), that hypothesis was not, however, part of the planned test strategy, but, instead, the associated statistical analysis – a chi-square test – was chosen by Radin sometime after the planned statistical analysis had been completed and the data unblinded. Second, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) violate the funder-approved research design in an additional way by falsely claiming that the newly developed protocol, i.e., the advanced meta-experimental protocol (AMP), implements a non-predictive test strategy when – in fact – the AMP-based test strategy is strictly predictive. Put simply, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) are mistaken that the funder-approved hypotheses posited the random occurrence of effects for the test categories in this replication experiment; instead, a different specific prediction was tested in each of the eight planned test categories, and true-positive effects were predicted to occur for only two (12.5%) of the 16 possible measurement outcomes of the eight planned single-test categories. Therefore, in the predictive single-testing regime, a statistical correction for non-predictive, i.e., random, multiple testing would not be appropriate and would thus violate the AMP-based strategy, which was implemented in the commissioned study based upon the planned outcome predictions as pre-specified in Radin (2011). Neither of these post-hoc changes by Radin et al. (on the basis of HARKing) were disclosed in Radin et al. (2019, 2020) and both these changes violate the funder-approved, original methodology agreed upon in Radin (2011) and pre-specified in the research contract. In summary, the present work reconfirms that – exactly as reported in Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019) – “the false-positive effect, which would be indistinguishable from the predicted true-positive effect, was significant at p = 0.021 (σ = −2.02; N = 1,250 test trials)” and “no statistically significant effects could be identified” in those two groups for which true-positives were predicted to occur. These observations are consistent also with an independent statistical reanalysis of the Radin DS-experiment by Tremblay (2019) and a replication attempt by Guerrer (2019). Tremblay reported significant false-positives in control groups and Guerrer found significant effects with post-hoc analyses only, but null results only when using the planned confirmatory analysis. As a general recommendation, the authors call for the implementation of advanced control-test strategies, including novel approaches from the metascience reform movement, for empirically detecting and preventing uncontrolled false-positive effects in parapsychological research.",Jan Walleczek et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-9EB-7DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-9EB-7DD,2020-07-29,2020-07-29T16:21:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; advanced meta-experimental protocol; confirmatory analysis; counterfactual meta-experimentation; radin double-slit experiment; harking; metascience reform movement,False
19,Belief in COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories Reduces Social Distancing over Time,"Background Conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19 are wide-spread and have even been propagated by highly ranked state officials and politicians in the U.S. Health authorities have cautioned that such theories, although not questioning the existence of the pandemic, may increase the spread of the virus by reducing people’s efforts to socially distance. Methods We test this proposition empirically using longitudinal survey data collected at five time points during the early outbreak of the virus in the U.S. (N = 403). Results Multivariate growth curve analyses showed that, although conspiracy beliefs decreased and social distancing increased over time, people holding more conspiracy beliefs at the beginning of the pandemic showed the lowest increase in social distancing. Moreover, cross-lagged analyses demonstrated that people who reported more conspiracy beliefs at any wave tended to report less social distancing at the following wave. Conclusions Our findings show that COVID-19 conspiracy theories pose a significant threat to public health as they may reduce adherence to social distancing measures.

20,Psychological distress and adaptation to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States,"Objective There is growing concern that the COVID-19 crisis may have long-standing mental health effects across society particularly amongst those with pre-existing mental health conditions. In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. Methods We analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from eight waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and July 20th, 2020 (N = 7319 Observations = 46145). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Results On average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p<.001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US. Distress levels subsequently declined to mid-March levels by June, 2020 (d =-.31, 95% CI [-0.34,-0.27], p<.001). Across the sociodemographic groups examined and those with pre-existing mental health conditions we observed a sharp rise in distress followed by a recovery to baseline distress levels. Conclusions This study identified substantial increases in distress in the US during the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis that largely diminished in the weeks that followed and suggests that population level resilience in mental health may be occurring in response to the pandemic.",Michael Daly et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717,2020-07-21,2020-07-29T13:44:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; resilience; mental health; adaptation; covid-19; longitudinal research; psychological distress,False

22,How intergroup contact and exposure predict anti-Asian prejudice in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Anecdotal reports suggest an uptick in anti-Asian prejudice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Across White, United States citizens (N = 609), this study examined whether: (1) objective (reported cases or deaths) or perceived (participant’s estimates of the same) threat from COVID-19 predicted anti-Asian prejudice, and (2) whether intergroup contact or exposure affect prejudice even during periods of intense threat. Threat from the pandemic was associated with greater prejudice toward Asian (but not Black or White) people, a pattern most pronounced when perceived threat from the pandemic was assessed. Intergroup contact was associated with less behavioral prejudice, and intergroup exposure was associated with more affective prejudice, toward Asian people regardless of the actual or perceived threat from COVID-19. These results suggest that increased anti-Asian prejudice in the United States occurs in response to perceptions of threat and demonstrates that intergroup factors have similar effects during periods of heightened threat.",Tara M Mandalaywala et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-190-32D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-190-32D,2020-07-28,2020-07-28T19:03:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intergroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; intergroup contact; intergroup exposure; covid-19; prejudice,False
23,"The Nature, Cause and Consequence of COVID-19 Panic among Social Media Users in India","Aims The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has not only shaken the healthcare but also economic structure around the world. In addition to these direct effects, it has also brought in some indirect difficulties owing to the information epidemic on social media. As India experienced a later outbreak of COVID-19 and a prolonged uninterrupted lockdown, we aimed to understand the nature of panic social media users in India are experiencing due to the flow of (mis)information. We further extend this investigation to other countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study by conducting survey on multiple social media platforms. We received 1075 responses (sex ratio 2:1) through opportunity sampling from social media users of 30 different countries (between April 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020). We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses on the 935 respondents from India. Several hypotheses are statistically tested on them and are further examined on rest of the 140 social media users from 29 other countries. We also performed a separate Twitter hashtag analysis and sentiment analysis on the responses. We applied a citizen science approach to involve the respondents in the analysis pipeline after the survey. Results This cross-sectional study on 1075 social media users from India and 29 other countries revealed a significant increase of social media usage and rise of panic over time in India. Middle-aged people and female exhibit a higher panic in India. The amount of panic was independent of the nature of association with COVID-19. The change of mental health was associated with panic level and productivity. Further qualitative analysis highlights the occurrences of information panic, economic panic, moral panic and spiritual panic, among other causes. Conclusions Several panic behaviors are unique to social media users in India possibly because COVID-19 broke out relatively later in comparison with the other countries and the uninterrupted lockdown prolonged for a long time. The amount of social media usage might not be causal but has a significant role in generating panic among the people in India. A significantly higher level of panic among the middle-aged people can be attributed to their higher amount of responsibility. The popularity of different hashtags, including the names of drugs under trial for COVID-19, in limited countries highlight that the causes of panic are not the same everywhere.

24,Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19: an observational study,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective: We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a “guns” semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress”, “isolation”, and “home” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ρ = -0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.",Daniel Mark Low et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1,2020-07-13,2020-07-27T23:23:17+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Bipolar and Related Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; machine learning; eating disorders; psychiatry; nlp; suicidality; health anxiety; natural language processing; adhd; mental health; reddit; covid-19",False
25,"Validation of the French Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its Associations with Depression, Anxiety and Differential Emotions","Abstract The COVID-19 crisis represents a global health concern, including mental health. Regarding the necessity to assess anxiety related to COVID-19, a scale was developed (Ahorsu et al., 2020). The goal of the present study was to validate of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in French (official language in 29 countries), and investigate its relationship with indicators of affective disturbances. The study was performed on 316 participants. The FCV-19S underwent a double back translation procedure. Its psychometric properties were evaluated. The French FCV-19S demonstrated a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties (strong internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, and good test- retest validity). With its robust psychometric properties in assessing the unidimensional construct of the fear of COVID-19, this scale will help to provide a better understanding of the relationship between emotions and psychological or psychiatric disorders during the pandemics in French-speaking countries.",Arnaud Carre et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-444-F07,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-444-F07,2020-07-21,2020-07-27T14:31:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; fear; french validation; fear of covid-19 scale; scale development; covid-19,False
26,Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review,"Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level.

27,Gender Differences in Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus,"Social distancing and hygiene practices are key to preventing the spread of Coronavirus. However, people vary in the degree to which they follow these practices. Consistent with previous findings that women adhere more to preventative health practices, in Study 1, women reported engaging in preventative practices regarding COVID-19 (e.g., social distancing, hygiene) more so than men. In Study 2, across three different Northeast U.S. locations, we observed a greater percentage of women wearing masks in public than men. In Study 3, U.S. counties with a greater percentage of women exhibited a higher reduction in movement as tracked by ~17 million GPS smart-phone coordinates.

28,Poor quality of sleep and its consequences on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected all Italy. The extreme virulence, the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. Methods Through an internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole COVID-19 lockdown (from 10thMarch – 1st phase - to 4th May – 2nd phase). We investigated the socio-demographic and COVID-19 related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study - sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales – 21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. Results 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers reveal several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died due to COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythm characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, extremely severe levels of stress, of anxiety, and of depression. Conclusions This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole lockdown in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population have had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures.

29,"Psychological, social, and situational factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions: A study of UK key workers and non-key workers","Although behavioural strategies (e.g. social distancing) have been effective in limiting the transmission of the infectious respiratory disease COVID-19, a longer- term solution, such as the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, is a global priority. Worryingly, vaccine hesitancy (i.e. the delay in acceptance or refusal of a vaccination despite its availability) is a growing concern and threat to public health. Perceptions of risk and symptom severity are important predictors of vaccine acceptance. As individuals working in key worker roles are considered to be at a higher risk of infection, this study sought to examine intentions to vaccinate and predictors of vaccine hesitancy in a UK sample of key workers and non-key workers. The study utilised a sample of UK adults who completed the 1-month follow up of The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study and indicated having not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (N = 1605). Overall, 74.2% of the sample (76.2% key workers, 73.1% non-key workers) indicated that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available to them in future. Key workers (and in particular health and social care workers) had a higher perceived risk of becoming infected in the coming months; however, key workers and non-key workers did not differ on the perceived severity of symptoms. For key workers, being female and perceiving oneself as having relatively low risk of being infected in the next 6 months was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. For non-key workers, however, being aged 25-54, having a low or average income and not knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with hesitancy. The proportion of individuals willing to accept a vaccine is encouraging but there is much room for improvement. Educating the public on the extent of asymptomatic infection and transmission may be useful since most individuals believed that if infected that would exhibit some degree of symptomology. Given the unique predictors of vaccine hesitancy in key workers and non-key workers, public health campaigns may benefit from targeted messaging. This research provides useful early estimates on intentions to vaccinate and predictors of vaccine hesitancy; however, continued monitoring is necessary as the COVID-19 situation develops and a potential vaccine is produced.",Sarah Butter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619C-861-A62,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619C-861-A62,2020-07-24,2020-07-24T21:05:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; symptom severity; vaccine; health behaviours; covid-19; perceived risk; key workers,False
30,Understanding the lived experiences of Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interpretative phenomenological analysis,"Background: Little research has examined mental health and well-being in the context of healthcare professionals (HCP) working during the COVID-19 pandemic within the UK. To our knowledge, no research has employed qualitative methodologies in order to examine this. We therefore aim to address this gap in research by qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to qualitatively examine the lived experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one broadly captured present and future challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic. Theme two captured the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs and theme three captured HCPs’ perceptions of the attitudes of the general public towards HCPs. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort.",Emily Mcglinchey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032,2020-07-24,2020-07-24T20:23:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; psychological wellbeing; covid-19; mental health; key workers; healthcare professionals; qualitative research,False
31,Individual differences in susceptibility to false memories for COVID-19 fake news,"Exposure to ‘fake news’ can result in false memories, with possible consequences for downstream behaviour. Given the sharp rise in online misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that influence the development of false memories. In a large, preregistered study (N = 3,746) we measured susceptibility to false memories following exposure to fabricated news stories about the pandemic, and investigated the effect of individual differences in (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) engagement with media or discussion about the coronavirus, (3) anxiety about COVID-19 and (4) analytical reasoning. We report that objectively-assessed knowledge about COVID-19 was associated with fewer false memories and with better discrimination between true and false stories. In contrast, participants who believed themselves to be very knowledgeable were more likely to report a memory for any story, true or false. Individuals who reported high levels of media engagement or anxiety about COVID-19 were also biased towards ‘remembering’ any given story, while also showed heightened sensitivity to the difference between true and false stories. Finally, higher levels of analytical reasoning were associated with fewer false memories and with a stricter threshold for reporting a memory for any story. These data suggest that false memories can form in response to fake COVID-19 news, and that susceptibility to this misinformation is affected by the individual’s knowledge about and interaction with COVID-19 information, as well as their tendency to think critically.",Ciara Greene et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-B2C-BED,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-B2C-BED,2020-07-24,2020-07-24T14:18:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; misinformation; false memories; covid-19; fake news; coronavirus,False
32,Sleep health in U.S. adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Understanding how health has changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to reducing and recovering from the pandemic. This study focused on how sleep health in the United States may have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep duration and number of days in the past week with difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and not feeling rested in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (2018 National Health Interview Survey, n = 19,433) was compared to the same measures in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected during the COVID-19 outbreak (2020 Luc.id, n = 2,059). Sleep duration was slightly shorter in 2020 than 2018 (d = -.05). Moreover, the prevalence of insufficient sleep duration (RR = 1.20) and the number of days with difficulty falling asleep (d = .54), difficulty staying asleep (d =.36), and not feeling rested (d = .14) was greater in 2020 than 2018. Twice as many people in 2020 reported experiencing at least one night of difficulty falling asleep (RR = 1.95) or staying asleep (RR = 1.75). Adults younger than 60 and those who belonged to an Asian racial group had larger differences than other age and racial groups between 2018 and 2020. Thus, sleep health in U.S. adults was worse in 2020 than in 2018, particularly in younger and Asian adults. Findings highlight sleep as target in future research and interventions seeking to understand and reduce the effects of the spread of COVID-19.",Garrett Hisler et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46004-C84-AC7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46004-C84-AC7,2020-07-22,2020-07-24T13:04:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; coronavirus; national health interview survey; covid-19; sleep,False
33,Can fake news really change behaviour? Evidence from a study of COVID-19 misinformation.,"Previous research has argued that fake news may have grave consequences for health behaviour, but surprisingly, no empirical data have been provided to support this assumption. This issue takes on new urgency in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. In this large preregistered study (N = 3746) we investigated the effect of exposure to fabricated news stories about COVID-19 on related behavioural intentions. We observed small but measurable effects on some related behavioural intentions but not others – for example, participants who read a story about problems with a forthcoming contact-tracing app reported reduced willingness to download the app. We found no effects of providing a general warning about the dangers of online misinformation on response to the fake stories, regardless of the framing of the warning in positive or negative terms. We conclude with a call for more empirical research on the real-world consequences of fake news.",Ciara Greene et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-134-824,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-134-824,2020-07-24,2020-07-24T12:55:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; coronavirus; warning; behaviour change; fake news; misinformation; covid-19,False
34,Identifying frail populations for disease risk prediction and intervention planning in the Covid-19 era: a focus on social isolation and psychosocial vulnerability,"Background: The early identification of fragile populations in the Covid-19 era would help governments to allocate resources and plan strategies to contain consequences of the pandemic. Beyond frailty, social vulnerability to environmental stressors, such as the social distancing enforced to reduce the SARS-CoV2 contagion, can modify long-term disease risk and induce health status changes in the general population. Methods: We assessed frailty and social vulnerability indices in 1258 Italian residents during the lockdown phase (March 14-31, 2020) via an on-line survey. We compared indices taking into account age categories (young, middle, older adults and elders) and gender. Results: While frailty showed a linear increase with age and was greater in females than in males, social vulnerability was higher in young adults and elders compared to middle aged and older adults, and in males than females. Both frailty and social vulnerability contributed in explaining the individual perception of the impact of Covid-19 emergency on health, which was further modulated by proactive attitudes/behaviors and social isolation. Conclusions: Social isolation and loneliness following the Covid-19 outbreak may exert dramatic psychosocial effects in the general population. The early detection of vulnerable categories, at risk to become ill and develop long-lasting health status changes, would help in the next future to prevent consequences on general well-being by allocating resources to targeted interventions managing psychosocial distress and increasing young adults and elderly resilience towards the post-Covid-19 crisis.",Chiara Cerami et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-1E1-A4E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-1E1-A4E,2020-07-24,2020-07-24T11:44:04+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology",False
35,"The link between coronavirus, anxiety, and religious beliefs in the United States and United Kingdom","Research has shown that stress impacts on people’s religious beliefs. However, several aspects of this effect remain poorly understood, for example regarding the role of prior religiosity and stress-induced anxiety. This paper explores these aspects in the context of the recent coronavirus emergency. The latter has impacted dramatically on many people’s well-being; hence it can be considered a highly stressful event. Through online questionnaires administered to UK and USA citizens professing either Christian faith or no religion, this paper examines the impact of the coronavirus crisis upon common people’s religious beliefs. We found that, following the coronavirus emergency, strong believers reported higher confidence in their religious beliefs while non-believers reported increased scepticism towards religion. Moreover, for strong believers, higher anxiety elicited by the coronavirus threat was associated with increased strengthening of religious beliefs. Conversely, for non-believers, higher anxiety elicited by the coronavirus thereat was associated with increased scepticism towards religious beliefs. These observations are consistent with the notion that stress-induced anxiety enhances support for the ideology already embraced before a stressful event occurs. This study sheds light on the psychological and cultural implications of the coronavirus crisis, which represents one of the most serious health emergencies in recent times.",Francesco Rigoli,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46022-D39-978,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46022-D39-978,2020-07-24,2020-07-24T08:02:24+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Religion and Spirituality; religiosity; coronavirus; covid-19; anxiety; stress; religion,False
36,Infographic on SARS-CoV-2 Airborne Transmission Improves Opponents’ View of the Benefits of Masks: Evidence from Serial Cross-Sectional and Experimental Data,"Prather and colleagues (Science, 2020) published a seminal infographic showing that “Infectious aerosol particles can be released during breathing and speaking by asymptomatic infected individuals. No masking maximizes exposure, whereas universal masking results in the least exposure.” The goal of this contribution was to assess whether explaining how masks are effective against COVID-19 can change the relevant correlates of mask-wearing behavior even in those opposing the measures. An experiment with 1,020 participants shows that viewing vs. not viewing the infographic increased the relevant knowledge about effectiveness and protection of others as well as protection of oneself. This was especially so for those opposing the measures.

37,Digital readiness and its effects on higher education student socio-emotional experiences in the context of COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on higher education in 2020. Worldwide, universities developed and implemented online courses for distance learning within a relatively short amount of time. The current study investigated how ready students were for this exceptional situation and how their readiness for digital learning influenced their socio-emotional experiences. N = 1,826 students from across all institutional faculties of a German comprehensive university took part in the online survey immediately before the semester began. Results indicate that, on average, higher education students seem to be ready for digital learning. A k-means cluster analysis revealed two groups of students that significantly differed with respect to their readiness for digital learning (in terms of technological equipment, prior experiences with e-learning, and skills for digital learning). Finally, students’ socio-emotional experiences, that is, their perceived stress, their work-life-balance as well as social and emotional loneliness significantly differed due to their cluster membership. Hence, the study points to the need to support higher education students in successfully coping with the challenges of emergency remote studying.",Marion Händel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EA-BBA-DE2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EA-BBA-DE2,2020-07-22,2020-07-23T07:59:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Situation; covid-19 pandemic; cluster analysis; readiness for digital learning; socio-emotional experiences,False
38,Values and well-being change amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland,"COVID-19 caused a global change in the circumstances and lifestyles of most people. We examined whether COVID-19 pandemic influenced what people consider important in life (values), as well as several aspects of their well-being. This extraordinary event has provided an unprecedented opportunity to observe the extent to which values and well-being are influenced by adverse external factors. Participants (N = 150) reported their values and subjective and eduaimonic well-being nine months before lockdown in Poland, two weeks and four weeks into lockdown. We observed a significant decrease in well-being and significant changes in values: there was an increase in the importance of self-direction, achievement, security and conformity, humility, benevolence and universalism, and a decrease in hedonism. These data are consistent with reports on well-being decrease during the COVID-19 coming from around the world and with data on the changes in values reported during earlier national and global crises.",Agnieszka Bojanowska et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-B23-4B7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-B23-4B7,2020-07-23,2020-07-23T07:41:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
39,Self-compassion buffers the adverse mental health impacts of COVID-19-related threats: Results from a cross-sectional survey at the first peak of Hong Kong’s outbreak,"COVID-19 has brought tremendous and abrupt threats to various aspects of our daily lives, from school and work to interpersonal relationships. Self-compassion is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people’s resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.",Bobo Hi Po Lau et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829,2020-07-23,2020-07-23T04:44:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; anxiety; covid-19; mental health; self-compassion; self-coldness; depression; hong kong,False
40,Personality Psychology in Times of Crisis: Profile-specific Recommendations on how to deal with COVID-19,"The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic posed a twofold global health threat: Besides the evident danger to human life, the corona crisis is also a psychological crisis. Psychologists worldwide have contributed to cushion the distress that is laid on many societies and enforce adaptive coping strategies. However, psychological support in the past has often been broadly applied, has not been particularly parsimonious and has often been focused on severe psychological stressors. In this brief report we describe the development and application of a low-threshold tool that generates personality-specific recommendations on how to functionally cope with the psychological challenges of the corona crisis. The tool gained widespread attention in Germany and many other countries and was well received by users.

Results from a large multi-country online survey (N=8,229) showed average elevated levels of anxiety and depression (especially in the USA, UK, and Brazil), associated with feelings of low control and social isolation. Although social isolation increased with the duration of quarantine, it was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Other mitigating factors include adaptive but not maladaptive coping, and the perception and trust that one’s government is dealing with the outbreak.

43,Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among adults at high-risk of COVID-19: a UK-wide survey,"PURPOSE Willingness of adults at high-risk of COVID-19 to receive a COVID-19 vaccine is unknown. There are key disparities in the risk and outcomes from COVID-19 by socio-demographic factors, including age, sex, level of deprivation, and ethnicity. A COVID-19 vaccination programme could inadvertently exacerbate these inequalities if it is not readily received by different population groups. In this UK-wide cross-sectional survey, we examined willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the general population and evaluated socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with willingness. METHODS Between April and June 2020, individuals in the general population were invited to complete an online survey; 2568 provided informed consent. Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was reported by 2152 (83.8%). RESULTS In total, 76.9% (1654/2152) reported being willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. One in five individuals at increased risk of COVID-19, as defined by UK government guidelines, were unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (119/589; 20.2%). Individuals from white ethnic group were more likely to be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine compared with those from BAME groups (79.9% vs. 55.9%, respectively), OR 2.84, 96% CI = 1.93 – 4.18, p ≤ 0.001. Willingness did not vary among adults at increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those not at increased risk. CONCLUSION A significant proportion of individuals in the general population are unwilling to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, including those at increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. There are socio-demographic differences in willingness, especially by ethnic group. Success of a vaccination programme for COVID-19 depends not only on the efficacy of the vaccine but also on its uptake.

44,Mental health risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic in the Polish population,"Background: The level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed. Risk factors for mental health in the Polish population have been identified. Methods: The 926 respondents completed a set of questionnaires consisting of questions concerning COVID-19, PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R) and their mental health status (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21). Results: Most respondents reported severe PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (44.06%), normal intensity of depressive symptoms (52.38%), anxiety symptoms (56.05%) and stress (56.48%). Female gender, parental status, having a relationship, at least a two-person household are associated with higher PTSS and DASS-21 subscale. A few physical symptoms, a medical visit, quarantine, negative health evaluation, and chronic diseases, knowledge of the increase in the number of infected people and the number of deaths are associated with higher levels of PTSS. Some of the precautions and the need for additional information on COVID-10, the certainty of a high probability of contracting COVID-19, a low survival rate and concerns about loved ones are associated with higher PTSS.

45,Religion and Reactance to COVID-19 Mitigation Guidelines,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, religious gatherings have become intense hot spots for the spread of the virus. In this research, we focus on the religiosity of communities to examine whether religiosity helps or hinders adherence to mitigation policies such as shelter-in-place directives. Prior research makes opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies while another predicts lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasi-experiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people’s movements.

46,Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS),"Abstract Parenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on children’s socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage children’s social and emotional needs, structure children’s activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.",Rebecca Waller et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3,2020-07-14,2020-07-19T19:23:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; parent-child relationships; parenting practices; adolescence; covid-19; children; home environment; moms; parents; childhood; dads; family,False
47,High Work-related Stress and Anxiety Response to COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in South Korea: SAVE study,"Background: We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. Methods: Participants for this study comprised 1,783 healthcare workers drawn from two hospitals inKorea. We adopted a cross-sectional online survey design and used an anonymous questionnaire from 20-30 April 2020, with information on demographics, psychiatric history, Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared to other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression, general anxiety, and virus-related anxiety symptoms (p < 0.01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) than married workers (20.3% vs 14.1%; p < 0.01), and junior (< 40 years old) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis adjusted with age, sex, and work duration identified three factors as significantly associated with healthcare worker's depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10): being a nursing professional (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 – 1.98), single (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.83), and higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15 – 1.22).

48,"Examining perceptions of stress, wellbeing and fear among Hungarian adolescents and their parents under lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic","Intensified anxiety responses and even symptoms of post-traumatic stress are commonly observed under quarantine conditions. In this study, the effects on fear, anxiety and wellbeing of the recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 were investigated in a sample of otherwise healthy Hungarians. Taking the family as a microsystem, differences in gender, age, family relationships and time spent in isolation were the main focus of this investigation. 346 parent-child dyads were examined; the children were 11-17 years of age. Standard psychological questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, WHO Wellbeing Index), and an open question test (the Metamorphosis test) were used, and the results analysed with the aid of basic statistical methods. Stress levels and wellbeing displayed a significant negative correlation with each other in both parents and children. Parental stress and levels of wellbeing had a weak but significant impact on the wellbeing of their children. Among the demographic variables examined, none of them was found to explain the wellbeing or stress level of parents. Natural catastrophes, such as pandemics, create a stressful social environment for parents, and therefore directly impact the psychological wellbeing of all family members.",Csikos Gabor et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-BC7-DA8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-BC7-DA8,2020-07-16,2020-07-18T07:38:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; stress; anxiety; adolescent; pandemic; children; covid-19; family; fear; resilience,False
49,"Psychological factors in Hungarian families under the coronavirus pandemic. The effects of resilience and stress on the wellbeing of adolescents, their interconnections within the family","Introduction: The period of coronavirus pandemic caused psychological stress for the families. An important factor in coping with such stress is resilience that can be described as a successful adaption to circumstances. Aims: The current study aims to investigate stress, resilience, and their interactions within Hungarian families. Methods: 346 parent-child dyad participated in the research by filling out online surveys that included demographic sheet and validated scales (CD-Risk, WHO, PSS). Results: The explanatory model for the children’s well-being is constructed to explain the connections among these psychological factors. Higher stress level predicts lower wellbeing both among parents and their children. The higher resilience of the child predicts higher wellbeing. However, parental resilience shows a weak negative correlation with the wellbeing of the child. Discussion: In accord with other studies the level of perceived stress was high. A surprising result of our research is that the parent’s resilience directly reduces their child’s well-being. However, a higher level of parental wellbeing (that is affected by their resilience) altogether leads to a higher level of well-being among the children too. These results can be useful for the professionals as the expected second wave of the pandemic will be surely burdened by psychological challenges.",Csikos Gabor et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-B08-9C4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-B08-9C4,2020-07-18,2020-07-18T07:32:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence,False
50,Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing,"COVID-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages given known age differences in social preferences, and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early popular media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. Across two samples, we found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporally discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Additionally, although older adults reported being more likely to contract COVID-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall COVID-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.",Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,2020-07-17,2020-07-17T17:52:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging,False
51,Development and validation of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS),"During respiratory viral epidemics and pandemics such as the COVD-19 pandemic, everyday behaviors such as leaving the house and touching frequently-used surfaces become the subject of fear and avoidance due to their potential for contagion. Despite the potential mental health related impact of this psychological phenomenon, there are currently no measures available that are designed to evaluate the extent to which individuals become fearful of these everyday situations during a respiratory viral pandemic. Here, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS) questionnaire across two samples recruited online (ns = 243, 341) recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the ARVIS is best described by a single factor and shows a high reliability (Chronbach’s alpha > .88). It showed convergent associations with state anxiety and low discriminant associations with general trait anxiety and depression. Moreover, the ARVIS was highly associated with the extent to which subjects reported engaging in handwashing and social distancing, demonstrating criterion validity. This new scale provides a validated measure for assessing virus-related fear that can facilitate research into the psychological effects of respiratory virus pandemics.",Toby Wise et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0,2020-07-17,2020-07-17T17:26:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; pandemic; fear; infection; avoidance; anxiety; covid,False
52,Validation to Spanish version of the COVID-19 Stress Scale,"There is a global consensus about the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to affect people's mental health. In this context, and prior to the formulation of mitigation strategies, tools are required that allow an objective and effective assessment of mental health risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of COVID-19 Stress Scale, formulated by Taylor et al. (2020), based on the concept of COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. A national sample of 1214 participating adults was taken in Colombia, who answered a translated version of the scale. Evidence of a hexa-dimensional structure was obtained whose goodness of fit indicators were Chi2 = 1215,759, Sig. =. 000, CMIN / DF = 2.202, RMSEA = .044, NFI = .943, TLI = .964, CFI =. 968 and FMIN = 1,967. Regarding reliability, an α = .924 and Spearman-Brown = .824 were obtained for the entire scale; the reliability indicators of the 6 subscales were also high.

53,"Sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in Italian school-age children and their mothers during COVID-19 lockdown","Background. By March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown to limit viral transmission of COVID-19 infection, which establishes home confinement, movement restriction, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools of every order and degree. The current study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in school-age children and their mothers during the lockdown. Methods. Using an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits (timing, quality, quantity), time experience, and psychological difficulties (emotional and behavioral) and of those of their children (6-10 yrs old) during the home confinement and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. Results. During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing, i.e., later bedtime and wake time, and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect the daily routines and to keep track of the passage of time. We also observe increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers’ psychological difficulties. Also, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, which degree varied depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their home during the lockdown reported a more regular sleep pattern, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their time perception. Conclusions. Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures are needed to be in place to mitigate their long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those in the smart working condition.",Nicola Cellini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-046-916,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-046-916,2020-07-17,2020-07-17T09:21:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior,False
54,"Three pillars of physical distancing: Anxiety, prosociality, and rule compliance during the COVID-19-pandemic","The outbreak of a global pandemic such as COVID-19 poses a challenge for societies across the world. Lacking both vaccination and medical treatment, the only way to combat the spread of a virus in its early stages are behavioral measures, particularly physical distancing behavior. The present work proposes three pillars of individuals’ engagement in physical distancing: anxiety, prosociality, and rule compliance. In a large (N = 1,504), pre-registered study among German adults, we studied both situation-specific tendencies and stable personality traits that are theoretically associated with these pillars in relation to self-reported physical distancing behavior and underlying motives. Results supported the importance of each of the proposed pillars for physical distancing behavior. That is, for each pillar, we found (some) relations of the corresponding tendencies and personality traits with physical distancing (motives) as expected.

In this study, a large-scale online survey was conducted in Japan to explore the determinants of infection preventive behaviors. In addition, this survey collected data on various attitudes and behaviors in this pandemic situation, including optimistic/pessimistic views and information dissemination behavior on social networking sites (SNS). The results showed that the infection risk perception of self and others were both associated with the preventive behaviors, but the social pressure was not. The results were unclear in regard to optimistic/pessimistic views for infection risk perception and prospect for the end of coronavirus outbreak. Surprisingly, information spreading via SNS was negatively associated with knowledge of COVID-19, which calls attention to the credibility of information on SNS. In addition, subjective evaluation of achievement in regard to preventive behaviors was higher for self than for other people. This suggests that a self-enhancement tendency may contribute to the evaluation of preventive behaviors. Despite limitations such as employing a cross-sectional survey design and using data collected only in Japan, our study provides useful insights into the determinants of infection preventive behaviors, information dissemination, and the self-enhancement tendency in the evaluation of preventive behaviors.

However, given researchers’ focus on group-level differences within disorder-specific treatments, it is unclear which transdiagnostic mechanisms influence these effects. Participants (n=19, Mage=31.8, 68% female, 95% Caucasian) with elevated emotion dysregulation completed daily reports of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a DBT skills training group (1,344 observations). We tested whether within-person skill use was associated with same-day negative affect, predicted next-day changes in negative affect, and was moderated by perceived emotion regulation effectiveness. Participants used more within-person skills on days of greater stress and anxiety, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety. On days of high, but not low, perceived effectiveness, people used more skills in response to more intense negative affect. The use, and perceived effectiveness, of more skills may be mechanisms by which DBT skills groups promote improved emotional functioning.",Matthew W.

57,Externalizing Behavior and Academic Achievement : Does evidence for causal relations exist?,"Children’s low academic skills are associated with a variety of behavior problems and maladaptive outcomes throughout childhood and adulthood. Given the prevalence of behavioral disorders is approximately 19% of all US children, understanding of the mechanisms through which academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems interact can inform effective intervention to prevent persistent academic failure, chronic behavioral difficulties, and related negative long-term outcomes. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to systematically review research on the association between low academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems, as well as evaluate the research indicating causal linkages, if any, between the two domains. Five databases were searched, including OVID Medline, PsycInfo, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, and Education Resource. Search terms included statistical designs that could support a hypothetical causal association (e.g., structural equation modeling). We screened a total of 1,808 studies, of which 18 met the final inclusion criteria. In total, seven studies reported small negative effects between the two domains, and only 4 reported effect sizes considered small to moderate.

58,A Person-Centered Approach to Profiling COVID-Related Experiences in the United States: Preliminary Findings from the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII),"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities around the world. Intensive health precautions have created constraints on mobility, work, education, family life, and interpersonal relationships. Preliminary survey studies have reported an increase in the prevalence and severity of psychosocial impairments in the pandemic’s immediate wake. However, the impact of specific pandemic-related experiences and patterns of experiences has not been systematically assessed and studied. The goal of the present study was to develop and conduct a preliminary empirical test of a novel, comprehensive assessment of pandemic-related experiences, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), using person-centered latent class analysis (LCA). Aims were to (1) test the hypothesis that LCA would identify unique subgroups based on patterns of negative and positive pandemic-related experiences across personal and social domains, and (2) examine whether identified subgroups would significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health and functioning. Results supported hypotheses, with several unique subgroups identified across domains that were differentiated on sociodemographic characteristics and measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and perceived social support. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This study, combined with future research with the EPII, may serve to inform public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the current pandemic and under similar mass public health crisis circumstances in the future.",Damion Grasso et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707,2020-07-01,2020-07-15T13:50:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; pandemic; covid-19; mental health; epidemic,False

At the same time, we are faced with the rapid spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive power of COVID-19 conspiracy theories in explaining the level of compliance with official COVID-19 guidelines, by including mediating roles of pseudoscientific information beliefs and trust in government officials. A total of 1882 participants provided sociodemographic information and completed all measures in the study. Multiple mediation analysis revealed a direct negative effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on the compliance with the preventive measures.

63,The quality of research on mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This systematic review aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open science practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases on the 13th of May. Empirical studies, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, between February and May 2020, were included. The dependent variable(s) required to be quantitative and related to mental health. Exclusion criteria included clinical pharmacological trials, and studies using psychophysiological or biological recordings. The study protocol was previously pre-registered in https://osf.io/bk3gw/. Findings: Twenty-eight studies were identified. More than 75% met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, 89.3% used convenience samples and 92.86% lacked of a priori power analysis. There was low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies (0%) and availability of databases (3.57%), which raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Interpretation: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor.

We therefore conducted a survey study (n=1022) with subsamples from the United Kingdom (n=502) and Netherlands (n=520). The results highlight the importance of people’s support for, and perceived efficacy of, the measures and preventive behaviors, and of the perceived norm of their family and friends adopting these behaviors.

65,Appealing to economic (vs. health) risk may be more effective to fight COVID-19: A multilevel analysis in 24 countries,"This paper examines whether compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures is motivated by wanting to save lives or save the economy (or both), and which implications this carries to fight the pandemic. National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N=25,435). The main predictors were (i) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (ii) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (iii) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support - and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified – both positive.

66,"Conspiratorial thinking during COVID-19: The roles of paranoia, delusion-proneness, and intolerance to uncertainty","The COVID-19 global pandemic has left many feeling a sense of profound uncertainty about their world, safety, and livelihood. Explanatory frameworks to make sense of this uncertainty are offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individual differences that predispose towards conspiratorial thinking (CT) have been investigated by past work, but never in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global pandemic. In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia mediated the relationship between intolerance to uncertainty and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in intolerance to uncertainty, delusion-proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of crisis and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide evidence that specific individual differences can create susceptibility to misinformation and may have implications for message framing strategies when designing informational interventions.",Emmett M.

67,The Impact of the Certainty of Information on COVID-19 Attitudes in Spanish University Teachers and Students,"The COVID-19 pandemic affects the whole world. Spain is one of the most affected nations. Prevention via information that fosters knowledge, reasonable concern, control and personal care is the most effective means to slow down the pandemic. In this intervention study we assessed extant knowledge, concern, control and care about the COVID-19 in 111 Spanish university teachers and students. Subsequently, we randomly assigned them to two groups. One group (n = 53) received uncertain information about the current measures of prevention whereas the other group (n = 58) received certain information. A group by time interaction revealed that the ‘certain information’ group reported immediately increased personal care about the pandemic. These findings suggest that measures known to be effective in COVID-19 prevention should be communicated with certainty (i.e. must be convincing) to influence people’s attitudes through the schematic organization of new information.",Ricardo De La Vega et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601A-5F8-A35,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601A-5F8-A35,2020-07-13,2020-07-13T20:12:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
68,How handling extreme C-reactive protein (CRP) values influences CRP and depression symptom networks: A replication and extension of Fried et al. (2019),"Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all other variables modeled. However, these analyses require a lot of power and replication is key to determine their utility in this context. Additionally, further investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. The current study attempts to replicate Fried et al. (2019), which found CRP to be uniquely associated with sleep problems, fatigue, and changes in appetite. In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite, no support for an association between CRP and sleep, and some support for additional CRP—symptom associations. Methodologically, results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP > 10 mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations.

69,Depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions in Germany.,"Since the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Germany, various lockdown measures were imposed across the country that likely had a large impact on psychological well-being. In the current study, we investigate depressive symptoms as depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease and potentially life-threatening. This study reports on a dataset that was collected between April 8 and June 1 2020 through an online survey in several German states. More than 2000 individuals took part in the survey measuring depressive symptoms (as defined in ICD-10). Similar to recent observations from Italy and China, severe depressive symptoms reported were relatively high. Especially younger adults and females reported more severe symptoms compared to other groups.

70,Trust in government and its associations with health behaviour and prosocial behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Previous studies suggested that public trust in government is vital for implementations of social policies that rely on public's behavioural responses. This study examined associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours. Data from an international survey with representative samples (N=23,733) of 23 countries were analysed. Specification curve analysis showed that higher trust in government was significantly associated with higher adoption of health and prosocial behaviours in all reasonable specifications of multilevel linear models (median standardised β=0.173 and 0.244, P<0.001). We further used structural equation modelling to explore potential determinants of trust in government regarding pandemic control. Governments perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised β=0.358, 0.230, 0.055, and 0.250, P<0.01).

71,Examining Mindset and Grit in Concurrent and Future Reading Comprehension: A Twin Study,"Non-cognitive factors have gained attention in recent years as potential intervention targets for academic achievement improvement in students. Two notable facets, intelligence mindset and grit, have been of particular interest. Both have been shown to consistently improve educational outcomes, although little work has focused on reading ability. We used a correlational and twin method design to preliminary test if mindset and grit could be potential intervention targets to increase reading ability. As such, we examined the relation between both grit and mindset on current, future, and change in reading comprehension ability in a twin sample. We used data from 422 twin pairs (171 monozygotic pairs, 251 dizygotic pairs) drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, Behavior and Environment (Taylor et al., 2019). Twins were on average 13 years old when the questionnaire and first reading ability measure were collected, and on average 15 years old when the second reading ability measure was collected. Weak and moderate positive correlations were found between both mindset and grit with each reading ability score and neither were significantly related to change in reading ability. Twin modeling suggested little to no common genetic or environmental influences between mindset and grit to reading ability. In total, our results do not lend support to the notion of mindset or grit being a mechanism of change for reading ability.",Kimberly M.

72,Bargaining under social distancing requirements: Effects of face masks on socio-economic decision-making in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Face masks play a pivotal role in the control and prevention of respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Despite their widespread use, it is not known how face masks affect human social interaction. In this behavioral economics study (N = 475), we examined how mask-wearing modulates individuals’ likelihood of acceptance of unfair monetary offers in an iterated social exchange. Overall, participants accepted more offers, including more unfair offers, from mask-wearing opponents than from opponents without a mask. This effect was enhanced when participants ascribed more altruistic motives to their interaction partner. Importantly, this pattern of results was only present for surgical face masks, but not when a non-medical cloth face covering was used. This is the first study to uncover a new phenomenon, the face-mask effect, in which face masks can alter human social behavior.",Ramzi Fatfouta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F4-076-388,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F4-076-388,2020-07-10,2020-07-11T13:19:47+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; social cognition; ultimatum game; construal level theory; fairness; decision making; covid-19",False
73,Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Evidence for Differential Susceptibility,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents’ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.",Jonas G.

74,Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden,"New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,2020-06-23,2020-07-11T00:08:14+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health; employment,False
75,Cyclical Across-Day Dynamics of Corona-Related Media Exposure and Worries in People’s Daily Lives During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: This study investigated how Corona-related media exposure during the COVID-19 crisis was related to same-day and next-day Corona-related worries. Methods: A sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12) completed online questionnaires across 21 days between late March and April 2020 in Germany. Every evening, they indicated their exposure to Corona-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their Corona-related worries on that day. Results: Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more Corona-related worries on days with higher exposure to Corona-related media. Examining the across-day relations among Corona-related media exposure and worries using dynamical structural equation models, there was evidence for a reciprocal cycle: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of Corona-related media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of Corona-related worries. Conclusions: These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle of crisis-related media exposure and worries. As such, the daily amount people spend consuming crisis-related information might augment crisis-related worries, amplifying adverse health effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike.",Andrea Schmidt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-FF9-E4A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-FF9-E4A,2020-06-17,2020-07-10T07:17:23+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; covid-19; worry; within-person dynamics; media exposure; ambulatory assessment; daily diary; well-being",False
76,The pathogen paradox: Evidence that perceived COVID-19 threat is associated with both pro- and anti-immigrant attitudes,"COVID-19 pandemic, as a global threat to humanity, is likely to instigate a variety of collective responses in the society. We examined, for the first time, whether COVID-19 threat perception is related to attitudes towards Syrian immigrants in Turkey, theorizing a dual pathway whereby threat caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would relate to both pro- and anti-immigrant feelings. While drawing upon behavioral immune system theory, we expected that pathogen threat would lead to more exclusionary attitudes; relying on the common ingroup identity model, we predicted that pathogen threat would promote inclusionary attitudes through creating a common ingroup in the face of a global threat. Results from two studies using online search volume data at the province-level (N = 81) and self-report measures at the individual level (N = 294) demonstrated that perceived COVID-19 threat was directly associated with more positive attitudes towards immigrants (Study 1 and 2). Study 2 further revealed indirect positive (through a sense of common identity) and negative (through perceptions of immigrant threat) links between COVID-19 threat perception and attitudes towards immigrants. These results highlight the importance of integrating evolutionary and social identity perspectives when assessing pathogen-related threats.

77,Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the U.S.,"Background: Stressful events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have significant effects on psychiatric symptoms, and well-validated methods for assessing psychosocial experiences related to the pandemic are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess the stability of the PSQ and prospective associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity and stability of the PSQ and indicated that experiences of stress are highly prevalent, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with depression and anxiety at each assessment, but did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: The PSQ is a promising measure for assessing COVID-19 pandemic-related events in research and clinical practice. Results provide empirical support for the range of life disruptions as a result of the pandemic and highlight individual differences and experiences associated with the greatest risk for depression and anxiety.",Autumn Kujawa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,2020-06-29,2020-07-08T22:48:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety,False
78,PERSONALITY TRAITS AND NARCISSISM AS PREDICTORS OF PATHOLOGICAL SELFIE AMONG UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATES IN NIGERIA,"This study examined personality traits and narcissistic as predictors of pathological selfie among undergraduates of university of Ilorin. An ex post-facto design using survey method was adopted while three hundred respondents (110 males and 190 females), participated in the study. Their age ranged from 16 years to 35years. A questionnaire pack which included-the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-16 (NPI-16); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and Selfie Behaviour Scale (SBS) was utilized. The results of t-test revealed that gender do not significantly influence pathological selfies (t=.763; df= 298; p>.05). However, there was a significant difference in the participants type of phones on selfie pathology (t (120)=-3.01, p<.05); respondents with smart phones (M=56.89, SD=10.25) significantly reported higher scores on pathological selfies compare to respondents with non-smart phones (M=53.23, SD=9.75). Multiple regression result showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism and narcissism jointly predicted pathological selfies (R=.49; R2=.29; F(6, 293)=15.09; p<.01). However, extraversion (β =.20; t =2.91; p<.05); agreeableness (β= -.29; t =-4.03; p<.01) conscientiousness (β=.24; t=3.90; p<.01); neuroticism (β = .19; t=3.91; p<.05) and narcissism (β=.22; t =3.91; p<.05) had independent significant prediction of pathological selfies.

79,“Quick and dirty”: Intuitive cognitive style predicts trust in Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, French public opinion has been divided about Pr. Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19. In this paper, our aim is to contribute to the understanding of this polarization of public opinion by investigating the relationship between (analytic vs. intuitive) cognitive style and trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Through three studies (total N after exclusion = 950), we found that a more intuitive cognitive style predicted higher trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Possible mediators included valorization of scientific method over personal experience, belief that truth is political, belief in conspiracy theories and belief in pseudo-medicines. Additionally, we found that higher trust in Didier Raoult and hydroxychloroquine was linked to higher pseudo-medical and conspiratorial beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, but not to self-reported behavior, such as lower compliance with official regulations.",Fuhrer Joffrey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-B2A-5D7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-B2A-5D7,2020-07-08,2020-07-08T20:04:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; didier raoult; covid-19; hydroxychloroquine; cognitive style; intuition; pseudo-medicines; reflection; conspiracy theories,False
80,"“I’m not Working from Home, I’m Living at Work”: Perceived Stress and Work-Related Burnout before and during COVID-19","The purpose of the study was to better understand the relationships among stress, work-related burnout, and remote working brought on by social distancing efforts and stay at home orders put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors developed a questionnaire incorporating valid and reliable self-report stress and burnout measures (Perceived Stress Scale & Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), demographic, and work-related questions. The questions were used primarily to determine workers’ levels of stress before and during the pandemic, to assess potential burnout, and to establish the extent of their previous experience with remote work/telecommuting. The questionnaire was open from March 23rd to May 19th 2020 and distributed through a survey link on social media and by Qualtrics research services. Results from the analyses suggest that perceived stress did increase during the COVID-19 restrictions, especially for people that had limited experience working from home and were female. Individuals who worked from home before COVID-19 had higher levels of work-related burnout but did not differ based on gender or part-time work status. The results suggest that working from home may create more stress and result in more burnout, which challenges the current moves by some employers to make working from home a permanent arrangement. The authors believe that having research based on valid and reliable instruments will help employers and schools make better decisions about how to support those who can remain at home to avoid the potential for secondary outbreaks.",Sherrill Hayes et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-109-58A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-109-58A,2020-07-08,2020-07-08T15:39:12+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Balance; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Quality; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; burnout; perceived stress; work-related burnout; stress",False
81,Risk perception and personal responsibility during COVID-19: An experimental study of the role of imperative vs reasoning-based communication for self-isolation attitudes,"Individual decision-making about social distancing, self-quarantine and self-isolation is crucial in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. In the rapidly evolving pandemic, little is known about how different government communication strategies may systematically affect people’s attitudes to staying home or going out, nor the extent to which people perceive and process the risk of different scenarios. In this study, we report results from a sample of 581 participants (residing in the United Kingdom), and we examine the degree to which participants’ attitudes regarding the permissibility of leaving one’s home are (1) sensitive to different levels of risk of viral transmission in specific scenarios, (2) sensitive to communication framings that are either imperative or that invite reasoning about scenarios, or (3) creating “loopholes” for themselves when scenarios are framed with reference to the participants themselves rather than in general terms. We find that participants’ attitudes to social distancing are sensitive to the level of risk of transmission, and that when scenarios are framed in imperative terms, rather than when their reasoning is encouraged, participants have more impermissive attitudes to going out in Minimal Risk scenarios, with a trend of decreased permissiveness more generally; for self-loopholes, more research is needed to determine if participants make exceptions for themselves. Thus, subject to the limitations of this study, during phases where it is important to promote self-isolation for all scenarios, including those perceived to be low risk, imperative communication may be best.",Simon Thomas Van Baal et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FF-088-542,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FF-088-542,2020-07-08,2020-07-08T14:35:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; social distancing; personal responsibility; public health communication; imperatives; reasoning; loopholes; risk perception; covid-19,False

However, the consequences of lockdown on psychotic symptoms have not yet been investigated. Methods: An online survey was run from April 13 to May 11, 2020; a total of 728 French subjects from the general population participated. We assessed the perceived impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, length of self-isolation, diagnosis/symptoms/hospitalisation related to the COVID-19 (oneself and family). Paranoid ideations and anomalous perceptual perceptions were assessed via the Paranoia Scale and the Cardiff Anomalous Perceptions Scale. Measures of negative affect, loneliness, sleep difficulties, jumping to conclusion bias, emotion regulation, and perseverative thinking were also included. Results: Final regression model for paranoia indicated that socio-demographic variables, loneliness, cognitive bias, anxiety, repetitive thoughts and hallucinations were associated with paranoia (R2 = 0.43). For hallucinations, clinical variables as well as the quality of sleep, behavioural activation, repetitive thoughts, and paranoia were associated with hallucinations in our sample (R2 = 0.27). Neither length of self-isolation nor the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with psychotic experiences in the final models. Conclusions: No evidence was found between a significant impact of self-isolation on psychotic symptoms in the general population in France one month after the lockdown. It nevertheless confirms the preeminent role of several factors previously described in the maintenance and development of psychotic symptoms in the context of a pandemic and lockdown measures.",Catherine Bortolon et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-F93-7AA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-F93-7AA,2020-06-26,2020-07-07T18:02:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology,False
83,Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.",Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-D39-1F2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-D39-1F2,2020-06-15,2020-07-07T17:59:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; psychological morbidities; public health; mental health; coping strategies; primary prevention,False
84,‘Distancers’ and ‘non-distancers’? The potential social-psychological impact of moralising COVID-19 mitigating practices on sustained behaviour change,"COVID-19 mitigating practices such as “hand-washing”, “social distancing” or “social isolating” are constructed as ‘moral imperatives’, required to avert harm to oneself and others. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention has facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social-interactional processes. We argue that the moralisation of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: i.e., derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID-19 mitigating practices and group polarisation between ‘distancers’ and ‘non-distancers’. In this paper we explore how and why these processes might come to pass, their impact on an overall societal response to COVID-19, and the need to factor such processes into decisions regarding how to lift restrictions.",Annayah Miranda Beatrice Prosser et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-27F-DAF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-27F-DAF,2020-06-15,2020-07-07T17:59:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intergroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; shaming; social distancing; behaviour change; practices; social identities; social policy; moralisation; covid-19; covidiots; mask wearing,False
85,Resilience During Uncertainty. Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue,"Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.",Jonas P.

86,"Knowledge, attitudes, and perception susceptibility towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American region","BACKGROUND: Latin American countries have been strongly affected by COVID-19. Due to the alarming prevalence of cases, we set out to explore which psychosocial elements may be exerting an influence on the poor compliance with mandatory control measures among the population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and susceptibility perception of Latin American population during the coronavirus outbreak. METHOD: We collected data from 600 self-selected participants through a web-based cross-sectional survey evaluating demographic information. The respondents were between 16 to 77 years old. The majority of the participants were female (n= 382), graduated professionals (56.8 %), citizens living in any country in South America (72.2%). RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that knowledge is highly related with age (p=0.010*), attitude is related with marital status (p=0.017*), perception susceptibility is related with education (p=0.049*), marital status (p=0.001**) and occupation (p=0.001**). Our study identified that, although people reported adequate knowledge by identifying expected symptoms and coronavirus transmission process. There is a significant perceived susceptibility to contracting the mentioning virus (57.7%), displaying stigmatized behavior (59.1%), fear of contracting the virus from others (70.2%), and concern regarding serious consequences after the COVID-19 disease (72.3%). Additionally, we found that people distrust National Health administration's response (61.57%), preparedness for the disease (73.8%), and suggesting insufficient measures to deal with COVID-19 disease (61.3%). CONCLUSION: Within the framework of government regulations, it is suggested that guidelines be considered to expand strategies and provide reliable knowledge to facilitate positive attitudes towards protection measures against COVID-19. Communication strategies would serve both to contain psychological reactions and the perception of risk of contagion, as well as educational actions to ensure compliance with public control measures among the population.",Jonathan Zegarra-Valdivia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F3C-660,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F3C-660,2020-06-10,2020-07-07T17:58:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; public health; health communication; knowledge; attitudes; perception; primary prevention; covid-19,False
87,"Warriors, worriers, and COVID-19: an exploratory study of the catechol O-methyltransferase Val158Met polymorphism across populations","Background: Prevalence and mortality rates during COVID-19 pandemic have varied widely across nations. This phenomenon may be partly due to regional variations in health-related behaviours, some of which may be influenced by health anxiety. A functional polymorphism of the catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, designated rs4680 or Val158Met, has been associated with anxiety-related behaviours and the so-called “worrier” phenotype. Methods: In this exploratory study, an analysis of the correlation between the frequencies of the Met allele of the COMT gene across 28 countries, obtained from the public domain Allele Frequency Database (ALFRED), and the COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rates in these countries, obtained from the Johns Hopkins Medical University web-based dashboard, was carried out while controlling for population size and median age in each country. Results: Allele frequencies varied widely across populations. Met allele frequency was positively correlated with COVID-19 prevalence (ρ = 0.527, p = 0.004) and mortality rate (ρ = 0.542) across nations. However, this association was no longer significant after controlling for confounders. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that there may be a relationship between the COMT rs4680 functional polymorphism and the impact of COVID-19 across nations, which could plausibly be mediated by maladaptive anxiety-related behaviours.",Ravi Philip Rajkumar,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46107-33C-31F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46107-33C-31F,2020-07-07,2020-07-07T13:36:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; covid-19; health anxiety; genetics; comt gene,False
88,"Social isolation, mental health and use of digital interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative survey","Background: Public health measures to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates may have negative psychosocial consequences in youth. Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We aimed to investigate the associations between social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress and use of digital mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the “Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey” —a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Data were collected on social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as the current use of and attitude towards digital interventions. Outcomes: Social isolation, lack of company, worrying, and objective social risk indicators were associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dose-response relationships were found. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of reported social isolation increased (with reporting ‘never’ as reference group: ‘very rarely’: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·4,CI 1·0 – 5·7, p=0·041; ‘rarely’: aOR 3·6, CI 1·7 – 7·7, p=0·001; ‘occasionally’: aOR 8·4, CI 4·0 – 17·5, p<0·001; ‘often’: aOR 20·6, CI 9·3 – 45·7, p<0·001;’very often’: aOR 43·4, CI 14·7 – 128·2, p<0·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, and high levels of social isolation, lack of company, and worrying were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas only severe levels of psychological distress and worries were associated with actual use (aOR 2·0, CI 1·3 - 3·0, p=0·001; aOR 1·6, CI 1·1 – 2·2, p=0·005, respectively). Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with social isolation and poor mental health outcomes in youth. Digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact without risk for viral infection given there is an objective need and subjective demand.",Christian Rauschenberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395,2020-06-29,2020-07-06T09:38:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; social isolation; public mental health; youth mental health; mhealth; social risk; worrying; covid-19,False
89,How does stress affect our life satisfaction during COVID-19 pandemic? Moderated mediation analysis of sense of coherence and fear of coronavirus,"COVID-19 is a significant threat to human life and health, which makes people experience fear, stress, anxiety and mood disorders, which have a negative impact on their psychological well-being. One of the resources that makes people manage stress better is a sense of coherence, which also has a positive impact on quality of life. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between fear of COVID-19, stress, a sense of coherence, and life satisfaction during the coronavirus pandemic. 907 Polish people (522 women and 385 men) participated in this study. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FOC-6), Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC-29) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used in the study. It was verified that the relationship between stress and life satisfaction was mediated by sense of coherence. The relationship between stress and sense of coherence was moderated by fear of COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 acted as a buffer in the relationship between stress and a sense of coherence - it weakened the impact of stress on the sense of coherence. This study is the first to verify the proposed model of moderated mediation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analyses were performed on a very large sample. This manuscript draws attention to the important role of fear of COVID-19 and the sense of coherence in our functioning. The sense of coherence can, by effectively managing stress and reducing the level of anxiety, affect subjective well-being.",Joanna Dymecka et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-1BD-8D4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-1BD-8D4,2020-06-25,2020-07-06T07:41:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; stress; life satisfaction; fear of coronavirus; covid-19; sense of coherence,False
90,Social Distancing Around the Globe: Cultural Correlates of Reduced Mobility,"Background: While the United States has struggled to keep the spread of COVID-19 at bay, many other countries have significantly stunted the number of new cases. Recent evidence suggests that cultural factors may play a key role in the spread of infection. To examine the cultural values underlying adherence to social distancing, this study used global cultural data as well as mobility scores from Google LLC’s global measurement on mobility. Methods: A composite variable for country-level engagement in social distancing was created from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020 (N = 14,022) across 118 countries. Segmented piece-wise multilevel modeling was used to examine the influence of cultural values of uncertainty avoidance, individualism-collectivism, tightness-looseness, and societal level of trust in three distinct time frames: 1) from February 15, 2020 to the country’s 100th COVID-19 case, 2) the first 30 days after each country’s 100th COVID-19 case, and 3) from the 31st day after the 100th case to June 7, 2020. Results: Results showed that collectivism promoted quick mobilization of social distancing behaviors while uncertainty avoidance stunted this mobilization. After the 100th case of COVID-19, high societal level of trust was related to the decline of social distancing behaviors. Interaction effects showed that countries high on uncertainty avoidance, collectivism, and tightness were all quicker to engage in social distancing at the earliest stages of the pandemic but not at the later stages. Conclusion: With the imminent second wave of COVID-19, policy makers and health scholars may explore the efficacy of culture-specific policies, strategies, and social interventions in mobilizing social distancing measures.",Hohjin Im et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-C97-EFB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CE-C97-EFB,2020-06-27,2020-07-04T22:40:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; covid-19; uncertainty avoidance; tightness-looseness; individualism-collectivism; social distancing; trust,False

Thus, in this study, we investigated the associations among the socioeconomic changes driven by the pandemic, mental health, life satisfaction (past, present, and future), and fear of COVID-19 in Japan. In total, 560 Japanese individuals took an online survey that included questions on their self-restraint and changing incomes and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale; and present, past, and future life satisfaction scale.

93,The Bittersweet Dynamics of Psychological Distress and Relief During New Zealand’s COVID-19 Lockdown Clarify Avoidable Mental Health Burdens,"Research indicates COVID-19 lockdowns elevated psychological distress. Here, we leverage national panel data before and during New Zealand’s COVID-19 lockdown to clarify distress buffers (2018/2020, N = 940). To distinguish lockdown-related distress from natural disasters, we investigate distress dynamics following the Christchurch earthquakes (2011, N = 6,806). During lockdown, there were small increases in hopelessness, restlessness, and nervousness, and substantial increases in worthlessness. A sense of neighbourhood community became decoupled from this distress, which high levels of social belonging and health satisfaction did not prevent. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort fostered by social belonging. By contrast, the Christchurch earthquakes increased all distress indicators and distress buffers performed consistently. We infer that losses of employment and social routines during New Zealand’s lockdown, in a setting of government income and health protections, precipitated bittersweet mental health dynamics.

94,When Social Interaction Backfires: Frequent Social Interaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period Is Associated with Decreased Well-Being and Higher Panic Buying,"The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying.

95,How confidence in health care systems affects mobility and compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Trust in the health care system requires being confident that sufficient and appropriate treatments will be provided if needed. The COVID-19 public health crisis is a significant, global, and (mostly) simultaneous test of the behavioral implications arising from this trust. We explore whether populations reporting low levels of confidence in the health care system exhibit a stronger behavioral reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. We track the dynamic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic across 38 countries and 621 regions by exploiting a large dataset on human mobility generated between February 15 and June 5, 2020 and a broad range of contextual factors (e.g. deaths or policy implementations). Using a time-dynamic framework we find that societies with low levels of health care confidence initially exhibit a faster response with respect to staying home. However, this reaction plateaus sooner, and after the plateau it declines with greater magnitude than does the response from societies with high health care confidence. On the other hand, regions with higher confidence in the health care system are more likely to reduce mobility once the government mandates that its citizens are not to leave home except for essential trips, compared to those with lower health care system confidence. Regions with high trust in the government but low confidence in the health care system dramatically reduce their mobility, suggesting a correlation for trust in the state with respect to behavioral responses during a crisis.",Ho Fai Chan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-53E-7A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-53E-7A9,2020-07-03,2020-07-03T08:45:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; trust; covid-19; health behavior; health care,False
96,Reduced social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample,"Antisocial behaviors cause harm, directly or indirectly, to others’ welfare. The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a preregistered study using an online U.S. sample we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p=.016, n=117) and standing closer to others while outside (p<.001, n=114). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Katherine O'Connell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-8B3-BC8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-8B3-BC8,2020-06-15,2020-07-02T19:43:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; antisocial; social distancing; adult personality,False
97,Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling). Supporting this idea, two studies using data from the U.K. (cross-sectional) and the U.S. (longitudinal) show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors in the past as well as in the future.",Max Hui Bai,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,2020-07-02,2020-07-02T01:28:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
98,Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress,"Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables.

99,Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences,"Intro: When confronted with major threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people often experience (temporary) decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying stability and change of well-being in times of threat like the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined change in mental health symptoms and its relationships with appraisals of the pandemic and daily life experiences during the pandemic, including affective states, stress, and mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. In this report, we worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as a total of 7189 observations from the diary phase. Results: Results showed that less fortunate change in mental health symptoms across three weeks was predicted by more negative affect and less mindfulness, specifically less attention to the present moment, in daily life. Furthermore, less fortunate change in mental health symptoms was correlated with change towards less fortunate appraisals of the appraisals. Finally, we showed that more general views of the pandemic (i.e., appraisals) were interrelated to experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and they show how experiences in daily life matter for change in well-being",Annette Brose et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B,2020-06-30,2020-07-01T12:36:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; stress; well-being; mindfulness; affect; ambulatory assessment; mental health; covid-19,False
100,"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.",Ruth Neill et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF,2020-07-01,2020-07-01T09:57:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; anxiety; depression; media consumption; mental health; covid-19,False
101,Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment,"Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.",Mokhlesur Rahman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1,2020-06-30,2020-06-30T20:05:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
102,Boredom and rule breaking during COVID-19,"State boredom presents a conundrum: When bored, we want to engage with something, but we don’t want whatever is currently available. This is exacerbated when external factors impose restrictions on what we can engage in, which is precisely the scenario we are currently facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed 924 participants to examine the relation between boredom proneness and responses to social isolation. We provide novel evidence that highly boredom prone people have been more likely to break the rules of social isolation (e.g., fewer hours spent in social isolation, poor adherence to social distancing as evidenced by the increased likelihood of holding a social gathering and coming into proximity with more people than recommended). We further demonstrated that boredom proneness substantially mediates the association between self-control and rule-breaking. These results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical factor to consider when encouraging adherence to social isolation.",James Danckert et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-909-D2E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-909-D2E,2020-06-30,2020-06-30T15:15:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation,False
103,Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.",Samantha M.

104,Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity,"Background. Previous studies carried out in different countries indicated that young adults experience higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which epidemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose. The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, as well as perceived difficulties related to pandemic across four age groups in the Polish population; (ii) which factors and difficulties related to pandemic are predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method. A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The group was a representative sample of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed online: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, Social Support Sale, Scale of Epidemic-Related Difficulties. Results. Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Difficulties in relationships and at home were amongst the strongest predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus were one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18-29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms only in the youngest group. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members were the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, it is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Małgorzata Gambin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9,2020-06-29,2020-06-30T14:48:15+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Old Age; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19 outbreak; lockdown; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; epidemic-related difficulties,False

106,Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings,"COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

107,"Children Coping, Contextual Risk and their Interplay during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Spanish Case","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the lives of millions of people around the globe and some of the unprecedent emerged disruptions, are likely to have been particularly challenging for young children (e.g., school closures, social distancing measures, movement restrictions). Studying the impact of such extraordinary circumstances on their well-being is crucial to identify processes leading to risk and resilience. To better understand how Spanish children have adapted (or fail to) to the stressful disruptions resulting from the pandemic outbreak, we examined the effects of child coping and its interactions with contextual stressors (pandemic and family-related) on child adjustment, incorporating in our analysis a developmental perspective. Data was collected in April 2020, through parent-reports, during the acute phase of the pandemic and, temporarily coinciding with the mandatory national quarantine period imposed by the Spanish Government. A sample of 1,123 Spanish children (50% girls) aged three to 12 (Mage = 7.26; SD = 2.39) participated in the study. Results showed differences in the use of specific strategies by children in different age groups (i.e., 3-6, 7-9 and 10-12-year-olds). Despite the uncontrollable nature of the pandemic-related stressors, child disengagement coping was distinctively associated to negative outcomes (i.e., higher levels of behavioral and emotional difficulties), whereas engagement coping predicted psychosocial adjustment across all age groups. Moreover, interactively with child coping, parent fear of the future and parent dispositional resilience appear as relevant contextual factors to predict both negative and positive outcomes, but their effects seem to be age dependent, suggesting a higher contextual vulnerability for younger children. These findings might have implications for identifying individual and contextual risk and informing potential preventive interventions aimed to reduce the impact of future pandemic outbreaks on children of different ages.",Beatriz Domínguez-Álvarez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46239-F0B-78D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46239-F0B-78D,2020-06-29,2020-06-29T19:44:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; children coping; child adjustment; covid-19; pandemic; parent resilience,False
108,Support and Goal Outcomes during COVID-19,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been stuck indoors with their partners for months. Having a supportive partner is likely to be especially important during this time where access to outside sources of support is limited. Individuals have to continue to work on goals and tasks while dealing with demands caused by the pandemic. The present mixed-methods study aimed to investigate how partner support is associated with goal outcomes during COVID-19. The quantitative participants (n = 200) completed a daily diary for a week and weekly longitudinal reports for a month and 48 participants attended a semi-structured interview.

Previously, the focus has been on how to formulate the message, rather than on who should send it, and particularly little is known about the latter during times of crisis. We report on the effectiveness of different public figures at promoting social distancing in 6 countries severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Across countries and demographic strata, immunology expert Dr. Anthony Fauci achieved the highest level of respondents’ willingness to reshare a call to social distancing, followed by a government spokesperson. Celebrity spokespersons were least effective. The likelihood of message resharing increased with age and when respondents expressed positive sentiments towards the spokesperson.

110,Coping behaviors and psychological disturbances in youth affected by the COVID-19 health crisis,"The COVID-19 epidemic and the quarantine that children in many countries have had to undergo is a stressful situation about which little is known so far. The coping behaviors carried out by children and adolescents to face home confinement can be associated with their emotional welfare. The objectives of this study were: 1) to examine the coping strategies carried out by children and adolescents during the COVID-19 health crisis, 2) to analyze the differences in these behaviors in three countries, and 3) to examine the relationship between different modalities of coping and better adaptation. Participants were 1,480 parents of children aged 3-18 years from three European countries (n Spain = 431, n Italy = 712, and n Portugal = 355). The children’s mean age was 9.15 years (SD = 4.27). Parents completed an online survey providing information on symptoms and coping behaviors observed in their children. The most frequent coping strategies were accepting what is going on (58.9%), collaborating with quarantine social activities (e.g., drawings on the windows, supportive applauses) (35.9%), acting as if nothing is happening (35.5%), highlighting pros of being at home (35.1%), and not seeming worried about what is happening (30.1%). Compared to Italian and Spanish children, Portuguese children used a sense of humor more frequently when parents talked about the situation. Acting as if nothing happened, collaborating with social activities, and seeking comfort from others was more likely in Spanish children than in children from the other countries. Compared to Portuguese and Spanish children, those from Italy seem not worried about what was happening. Overall, an emotional-oriented coping style was directly correlated with a greater presence of anxious symptoms, as well as mood, sleep, behavioral, and cognitive alterations. Task-oriented and avoidance-oriented styles were related to better psychological adaptation, measured as the low presence of psychological symptoms. Results also show that unaffected children or children with a lower level of impact were more likely to use strategies based on a positive focus on the situation.

111,Public Attitudes Toward Allocating Scarce Resources During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The general public is subject to triage policies that allocate scarce lifesaving resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the worst public health emergencies in the past 100 years. However, public attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies used during this pandemic are not well understood. Three experiments (preregistered; online samples; N = 1,868; U.S. residents) assessed attitudes toward ethical principles underlying triage policies. The experiments evaluated assessments of utilitarian, egalitarian, prioritarian, and social usefulness principles in conditions arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, involving resource scarcity, resource reallocation, and bias in resource allocation toward at-risk groups, such as the elderly or people of color. We found that participants agreed with utilitarian and prioritarian principles for allocating scarce resources during initial allocation and disagreed with egalitarian and social usefulness principles. However, support for these principles did not extend to resource reallocation between existing patients. Lastly, participants did not agree with utilitarian principles when they disadvantaged at-risk groups, such as people of color and people with disabilities. Abandoning utilitarian principles that disadvantaged people of color in favor of equitable allocation resulted in significantly more agreement with triage policy. Understanding these attitudes can contribute to developing triage policies, increase trust in health systems, and assist them in achieving their goals of patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Wesley Buckwalter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E4-665-B91,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E4-665-B91,2020-06-28,2020-06-28T12:32:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination,False
112,Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong,"Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing have been effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health has not been investigated. We conducted an online survey of residents in Hong Kong. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. The result of this online survey indicates a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis-risk. Loneliness, but not social network size, explained 12.0% to 29.2% of variance in these psychiatric symptoms. To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness. Although the sociopolitical situation of Hong Kong prior to the pandemic was likely another exacerbating factor, given that sociopolitical unrest and violence are common, global problems that co-exist with the pandemic, the case of Hong Kong may prove to be prescient.",Ivy Tso et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5,2020-06-27,2020-06-27T02:54:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; stress; covid-19; loneliness; anxiety; mental health; social isolation; psychosis; depression; psychosis risk; psychiatry,False
113,"Awareness, risk perception, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in communities of Tamil Nadu, India","As the health and economic impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) expands globally, growing attention is being paid to low-or lower-middle-income countries due to high population densities, limited access to health-case-service, and existing financial burdens. Yet, literature on the psychological reaction to COVID-19 pandemic in low- or lower-middle-income countries is still limited. In this study, we examined people’s awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, perceived risk of contracting coronavirus, fear in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in behaviors and stress during the lockdown in peri-urban areas in Tamil Nadu India. Field workers conducted rapid phone call surveys (N=2044) in 26 communities from May 20th – 25th 2020. We found that the majority of the residents in our sampled community perceived no (60%) or low (23%) level of risk of personally contracting coronavirus. Common fears were related to both the health and economic impact of the pandemic, including loss of income (62%), inability to travel freely (46%), self might get sick (46%), and food shortage (39%). Residents were well-aware of the common symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (66%) and dry cough (57%), but only a small proportion (24%) mentioned the asymptomatic features of COVID-19. A considerable proportion reported that they did not increase their practice of preventive behaviors since the lockdown, which included not reducing social gatherings (26%), not increasing social distancing practices (19%), and not inform others of COVID-19 related facts (30%). The majority experienced increased stress about finance (79%) and about the lockdown (51%). Our findings emphasize the need to develop context-adequate education and communication programs aimed to raise vigilance about coronavirus, specifically focused on factors such as its asymptomatic features, and to sustain preventive behaviors.

114,"Changes in Social Connection During COVID-19 Social Distancing: It’s Not (Household) Size That Matters, It’s Who You’re With","In an effort to slow down the transmission of COVID-19, countries around the world implemented social distancing and stay-at-home policies—potentially compelling people to rely more on household members for their sense of closeness and belonging. To understand the conditions under which people felt the most connected, we examined whether changes in overall feelings of social connection varied as a function of household size and household composition. In two pre-registered studies, undergraduates in Canada (NStudy 1 = 548) and adults primarily from the U.S. and U.K. (NStudy 2 = 336) reported on their perceived social connection once before and once during the pandemic. In both studies, living with a romantic partner robustly and uniquely buffered shifts in social connection during the first phases of the pandemic (βStudy 1 = .22, βStudy 2 = .16). In contrast, neither household size nor other aspects of household composition predicted changes in connection.

115,"Boredom makes it difficult, but it helps to have a plan: Investigating adherence to social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), social distancing has become important for containing the pandemic and preventing a renewed spread of the virus. We investigated psychological factors that predict adherence to social distancing guidelines. In a two-part longitudinal study (N = 574), we assessed adherence and its difficulty twice, one week apart. At T1, participants either planned to deal with the difficulties of adherence (planning intervention) or not (control condition). We further measured individual differences in planning, self-control, and boredom. T2 adherence was higher in the planning intervention, when participants intended to use plans. Trait planning was associated with higher T1 and T2 adherence and mitigated negative effects of T1 difficulty. Analogous effects emerged for trait self-control at T1. Trait boredom was associated with higher difficulty at T1 and T2 without directly affecting adherence.

116,Judgments of Businesspeople Who Shake Hands in the Era of COVID-19,"Traditionally, handshaking has conferred benefits for businesspeople—signaling politeness, establishing an intention to cooperate, and promoting deal-making. How might the psychological meaning of handshaking have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led handshaking to become touted as an imminent threat to public health? Through a highly powered, preregistered study (N = 595), we compared U.S. adults’ perceptions of a businessperson who shakes hands vs. refrains from shaking hands during the era of COVID-19. Participants judged handshakers more negatively than non-handshakers, in terms of both global attitude toward them (d = 2.21) and approval of their job performance (d = 2.66). Mediation analyses suggest that businesspeople were judged negatively for shaking hands principally because doing so made them seem less competent and less moral. Judgments of handshaking were more negative among liberals than conservatives and among women than men. To maximize others’ perceptions of them, it would behoove businesspeople to refrain from shaking hands for the foreseeable future. The months and years ahead may be an unprecedented time to rediscover the psychology of handshaking and its role in the workplace.",Daniel L.

118,Loneliness in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional results from The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study,"Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 – 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms. Improving emotion regulation and sleep quality may be optimal initial targets to reduce the impact of COVID-19 regulations on mental health outcomes.",Jenny Groarke et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E,2020-06-24,2020-06-25T12:23:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; public health; mental health; covid-19; prevalence; risk factors; cross-sectional studies; protective factors; loneliness; emotion regulation,False
119,"A daily diary study on adolescents’ mood, concern for others, and giving behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic","Adolescence is a formative phase for social development. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures social contact with peers has been severely limited. In the current three-week daily diary study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and associated social distancing measures on Dutch adolescents’ mood, concern for others, and social behavior. Longitudinal analyses including measures before the pandemic showed that adolescents reported decreased levels of empathic concern, opportunities for prosocial actions, and tension, and increased levels of perspective taking and vigor during the first weeks of lockdown. We also investigated giving towards targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing novel Dictator Games, and how this was influenced by individual differences in empathy, contributions to society, and opportunities for prosocial actions. Adolescents showed higher levels of giving (i.e., 51 – 78% of the total share) to targets associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., doctor in hospital, individuals with COVID-19 or a poor immune system) and close others (a friend) compared to unfamiliar peers. Individuals who showed higher levels of empathic concern, gave more to others, regardless of target. Finally, adolescents who showed higher levels of general contributions to society gave more to an unfamiliar peer and friend, and those who showed higher levels of opportunities for prosocial actions gave more to individuals with a poor immune system and COVID-19. Overall, these results shed new light on adolescence as a crucial period in life for social interactions, and as a phase that is not only characterized by risk factors, but also by resilience and a willingness to meaningfully contribute to others and society.",Suzanne Van De Groep et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-357-28F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-357-28F,2020-06-25,2020-06-25T12:21:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Moral Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; longitudinal; giving; empathy; prosocial behavior; social behavior; mood; covid-19; adolescence; pandemic; daily diary,False
120,"Testing the effects of COVID-19 confinement in Spanish children: The role of parents’ distress, emotional problems and specific parenting","The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a great impact in our society. Because of its rapid spread, many countries, including Spain, were forced to impose drastic measures (i.e., restrictive lockdowns) to guarantee social distancing and isolation. In some countries, like Spain, these measures were particularly restrictive for children, who were forced to stay at home for more than 40 days, suffering a drastic change in their daily routines. The present study aimed to examine the effects of the Spanish confinement derived from the COVID-19 crisis on children and their families, accounting for child’s age. A range of child negative (e.g., conduct problems) and positive outcomes (e.g., routine maintenance) were examined, along with a set of parent-related variables, including resilience, perceived distress, emotional problems, parenting distress and specific parenting practices (e.g., structured or avoidant parenting), which were modeled through Path Analysis to better understand child adjustment. Data was collected in April 2020, through parent-reports, on a sample of 1,123 Spanish children (50% girls) aged three to 12 (Mage = 7.26; SD = 2.39). Results suggested that, according to parents’ information, most children did not show important changes in behavior, although some increase rates were observed for both negative and positive outcomes. Child adjustment was influenced by a chain of effects, derived from parents’ perceived distress and emotional response to the COVID-19 crisis, via parenting distress and specific parenting practices. While parenting distress particularly triggered child negative outcomes, specific parenting practices were more closely related to child positive outcomes. These findings may help to better inform, for potential future outbreaks, effective guidelines and prevention programs aimed at promoting child’s well-being in the family.",Estrella Romero et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46054-5C8-5A7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46054-5C8-5A7,2020-06-24,2020-06-24T20:02:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; psychological impact; covid-19; children; parenting; family,False
121,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health: A Longitudinal Examination of Risk and Protective Factors,"The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to unprecedented changes in daily living. College students may face unique challenges associated with these changes. In the present study, college students (N = 205) completed a battery of questionnaires in April of 2020, after having completed similar measures 8, 5, and 2 months prior as part of a larger study. A repeated measures ANOVA suggested significantly greater depression and anxiety symptom severity during the pandemic than at any other time during the 2019-2020 academic year. Static and modifiable factors associated with psychological distress and controlling for pre-existing psychological distress were examined. Cognitive and behavioral avoidance was the most consistent predictor of psychological distress during the pandemic. Online social engagement and problematic Internet use also conferred greater risk.

122,Substitution behaviors among casino gamblers during COVID-19 precipitated casino closures,"Objective. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the closure of licensed casinos throughout North America in Spring 2020. This study sought to examine how gamblers responded to the COVID-19 lockdown, including migration to online gambling, and changes in substance use and use of other technologies. Method. We conducted an online cross-sectional study of US residents. 424 individuals with past three months gambling involvement were surveyed on 9 April 2020. Self-reported changes in online gambling and other addictive behaviors since the onset of COVID-19, problem gambling severity, and readiness to change were measured. Results. Overall, online gambling decreased following the onset of COVID-19 casino closures, t(220)=-2.87, p=0.003, 95%CI [-0.546, -0.101], d=0.193, while alcohol, p<0.001, tobacco, p=0.001, and cannabis use, p=0.01, increased among gamblers. Among gamblers who reported no online gambling involvement prior to COVID-19, 15% reported migrating to online gambling under lockdown. These migrators had higher levels of problem gambling, F=37.7, p<0.001, 𝜂2=0.152, and lower income, F=5.50, p=0.004, 𝜂2=0.025, than gamblers who had never gambled online. Conclusions. The response to COVID-19 is heterogeneous: in the short-term, the majority of gamblers reported reducing their online gambling, but increasing their substance use. A minority of gamblers appear to have substituted casino gambling with online gambling. As these individuals are characterized by problem gambling symptoms and lower income, they may be considered a vulnerable group.",Silas Xuereb et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-658-D16,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-658-D16,2020-06-24,2020-06-24T16:44:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; addiction; substance use; gambling; covid-19; substitution,False
123,The Balcony Party – Mitigation of social isolation during the coronavirus outbreak,"With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing need for assessing the psychological costs of social isolation (SI). We examine whether the balcony party can help people cope better with SI during the COVID-19 outbreak. We examined the psychological effects of SI on persons in Israel and Italy between March 23th, 2020 and April 2th, 2020. A total of 303 quarantined persons responded to a Web-based survey. We found that the effect of balcony parties on the psychological costs of SI is dependent on the level of social isolation. Those who experienced high levels of SI perceived the balcony parties as more beneficial in inducing positive affect and reducing negative affect in comparison to those who experienced low levels of SI. The opposite pattern was observed when individuals were asked about their participation in these parties: individuals with high levels of SI experienced balcony parties as less beneficial than similar pre-outbreak gathering events, while individuals with low levels of social isolation showed an opposite pattern. Finally, for those with high SI, balcony parties did not meet the expectation of creating feelings of communal solidarity. However, a discrepancy between high SI expectations and experience was not found for those with low SI. Our findings demonstrate that the balcony parties are beneficial in reducing the emotional cost of social isolation – but only for those who feel low levels of SI. The fact that individuals with high levels of SI expected more out of these parties suggests the need to develop interventions aimed at optimizing their expectations. As society enters a new period in which the costs of social distancing may be higher, our findings are valuable for understanding the psychological battle that individuals face while in social isolation.",Hila Zahava Gvirts,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616A-895-1E1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616A-895-1E1,2020-06-24,2020-06-24T15:50:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
124,How Does Social Distancing During COVID-19 Affect Negative Moods and Memory?,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment, the current best defence against COVID-19 is social distancing—staying at home as much as possible, keeping distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings. Although social distancing maximizes physical health, we know little about its psychological consequences. In this research (N = 374), we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased steadily as social distancing duration increased, at which point (~ 30 days) they began to steadily increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular. Thus, short-term social distancing might benefit psychological well-being and memory performance, but extended social distancing has the expected negative impact on mood and memory.",Weiwei Zhang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-2B8-CC1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-2B8-CC1,2020-06-23,2020-06-23T21:23:43+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; negative mood; social distancing; social isolation; false memory; covid-19",False
125,"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Environmental reward and self-medication theories suggest that increased distress and greater social/environmental constraints during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to clarify the presence and direction of changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 1127) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in an online survey. The survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes (alcohol use; drinking motives; alcohol demand, and solitary drinking). Outcomes were assessed for two timeframes: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (‘pre-social-distancing’), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (‘post-social-distancing’). Depression severity, coping motives, and frequency of solitary drinking were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Time spent drinking and frequency of binge drinking were greater post-social-distancing compared to pre-social-distancing, whereas typical alcohol quantity/frequency were not significantly different between timeframes. Indices of alcohol demand were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effects of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Results provide early evidence regarding the relation of psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, results largely converged with predictions from self-medication and environmental reinforcement theories.

Basic personality space was defined by the HEXACO model complemented by Disintegration, which represents psychotic-like experiences and behaviors reconceptualized as a personality trait. Mediation analyses conducted on a convenient sample from the general population recruited via social media or by snowballing (N=417) showed that engagement in pseudoscientific behaviors was predicted by high Disintegration.

127,Development of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9) scale for assessing work-related stress and anxiety in healthcare workers in response to COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had psychological impacts on healthcare workers. However, very few scales are available to specifically assess healthcare workers’ work-related stress and anxiety in response to viral epidemics. This study developed a new rating scale, the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9), and validated it among healthcare workers directly affected by COVID-19 in Korea. A total of 1,019 healthcare workers responded through anonymous questionnaires during April 20-30, 2020. Internal consistency of the SAVE-9 was measured through Cronbach’s alpha, and principal component analysis with varimax rotation was used to determine its component structure. It was also compared with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scales. Its most appropriate cut-off point was determined by conducting receiver operating characteristic analysis. The nine-item scale had satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s α=0.795). It adopted a two-factor structure: (1) anxiety about viral epidemics and (2) work-related stress associated with viral epidemics (Bartlett’s test of sphericity, p < 0.001; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.85). Correlations between SAVE-9 and the other scales were statistically significant. The cut-off points of the SAVE-9 and its anxiety subcategory were 22 and 15, respectively, compared with a GAD-7 score of 5. The results suggest that the SAVE-9 is a useful, reliable, and valid tool to evaluate stress and anxiety responses in healthcare workers during viral epidemics.",Seockhoon Chung Md et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-6FD-752,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-6FD-752,2020-06-11,2020-06-22T22:13:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; amc save-9 project; save-9,False
128,Stay at Home! When Personality Profiles Influence Psychological Adjustment and Creativity during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to “stay at home”. Although research suggests that social isolation affects mental health, reactions may vary depending on individuals. This study aimed to identify personality profiles, and examine whether these profiles were associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. Participants filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in France (N = 430). Based on measures of individuals’ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, a latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with an “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a convergent creative thinking task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns.",Estelle Michinov et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,2020-06-22,2020-06-22T13:37:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social isolation; covid-19; creativity; personality profiles; preference for solitude,False
129,Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment (NEAT): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Neurocognitive deficits (NCDs) and associated meta-cognition difficulties associated with chronic substance use often delay the learning and change process necessary for addiction recovery and relapse prevention. However, very few cognitive remediation programs have been developed to target NCDs and meta-cognition for substance users. The study described herein aims to investigate the efficacy of a multi-component neurocognitive rehabilitation and awareness program termed ‘Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment’(NEAT). NEAT is a fully manualized, cartoon-based intervention involving psychoeducation, cognitive practice, and compensatory strategies relevant across 10 major cognitive domains, including aspects of attention, memory, executive functions, and decision-making. Method/design: In a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), 80 female opioid and/or methamphetamine users will be recruited from an addiction recovery program providing an alternative to incarceration for women with substance use related offenses. Eight groups of 9-12 participants will be randomized into NEAT or treatment-as-usual (TAU). NEAT involves 14 90-min sessions, delivered twice weekly. The primary outcome is change in self-reported drug craving from before to after intervention using obsessive compulsive drug use scale. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include additional psychological, neurocognitive and structural and functional neuroimaging measures. Clinical measures will be performed at five time points (pre- and post- intervention, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up); neuroimaging measures will be completed at pre- and post-intervention. Discussion: The present RCT is the first study to examine the efficacy of an adjunctive neurocognitive rehabilitation and awareness program for addiction. Results from this study will provide initial information concerning potential clinical efficacy of the treatment, as well as delineate neural mechanisms potentially targeted by this novel intervention.

130,Formalizing interdisciplinary collaboration in the CogSci community,"Is cognitive science interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary? We contribute to this debate by examining the authorship structure and topic similarity of contributions to the Cognitive Science Society from 2000 to 2019. We compare findings from CogSci to abstracts from the Vision Science Society over the same time frame. Our analysis focuses on graph theoretic features of the co-authorship network—edge density, transitivity, and maximum subgraph size—as well as clustering within the topic space of CogSci contributions. We also combine structural and semantic information with an analysis of homophily. We validate this approach by predicting new collaborations in this year’s CogSci proceedings. Our results suggest that cognitive science has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the last 19 years. More broadly, we argue that a formal quantitative approach which combines structural co-authorship information and semantic topic analysis provides inroads to questions about the level of interdisciplinary collaboration in the cognitive science community.",Lauren A.

This study examined the mediating effect of COVID-19 coping strategies on the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health. Design: Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods: Participants (70% females) included 4,624 adults (Mage=30.29±10.97 years) collected through online survey. Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a one-factor structure for the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, COVID-19 Coping Scale, and General Health Scale which exhibited good internal consistency reliability. Findings showed that COVID-19 anxiety was negatively related with COVID-19 coping and general health. COVID-19 coping had a positive relationship with general health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that COVID-19 coping partially mediated the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health. Conclusions: These findings shed more light on the mechanism underlying between COVID-19 anxiety and health. The findings are important for tailoring and implementing coping-based intervention strategies to reduce the impact of COVID-19 anxiety on general health.",Murat Yıldırım et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46068-FF0-714,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46068-FF0-714,2020-06-17,2020-06-18T05:01:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; coronavirus; covid-19 coping; general health; turkey; covid-19 anxiety,False
132,Source of Information in Times of Health Crisis: Evidence from Turkey During COVID-19,"Aim: Media as a source of information can shape public opinion toward COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the source of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors - age, gender, educational attainment, and perceived economic level – on source of information. Subject and Methods: An online survey (n = 4,624) was conducted on the Turkish public during early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable source of information. Higher age, educational attainment, and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism, and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family, and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and that postgraduates attended informative meeting and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status respectively watched more TV and read more newspapers while people with low socioeconomic status attended less in informative meetings. Conclusion: In sum, this study provides evidence that a source of information might be influenced by demographic factors. Researchers and policymakers can use a source of information to develop crisis-response strategies by considering variations in the demographic factors.",Ekmel Geçer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AA-46A-B59,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AA-46A-B59,2020-06-17,2020-06-18T05:00:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; source of information; coronavirus; covid-19; turkey; demographic factors,False
133,Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study,"Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched case–control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. Conclusion: These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.",Abu Sayeed et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-9CC-022,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-9CC-022,2020-06-17,2020-06-18T05:00:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; covid-19; comorbidity; bangladesh; mental health,False
134,Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review,"The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.",Jenna Sung et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801,2020-06-18,2020-06-18T01:25:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy,False
135,The psychological wellbeing of frontline workers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: First and second wave findings from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study,"Background: Extant research relating to the psychological impact of infectious respiratory disease epidemics/pandemics suggests that frontline workers are particularly vulnerable. Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of ‘lockdown’ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 – 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%). Conclusions: These findings offer timely and valuable information on the psychological health status of UK’s frontline workforce during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and may aid in preparations for their future psychological and mental health support.",Jamie Murphy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-C85-1DA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-C85-1DA,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T23:08:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health,False
136,Daily associations between sleep and physical activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The day-to-day variations of sleep and physical activity are associated with various health outcomes in adults, and previous studies suggested a bidirectional association between these behaviors. The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep – physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g. inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. Future studies should examine sleep and physical activity during a longer period and perform additional sophisticated statistical analyses.",Sarah Atoui et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-2BA-AA2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-2BA-AA2,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T20:48:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; intraindividual; insomnia; sleep; ambulatory assessment; daily; physical actvity,False
137,"Increased mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption during the spring of 2020. Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. A sample of 148 students (86.5% female, 49.3% White) completed measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the spring 2020 semester at a university in the southeastern U.S. Their results were compared to those of 240 students (87.9% female, 64.2% White) who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants. Worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being in multiple domains. Additionally, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19 but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic. Universities and practitioners who work with college students can help young adults manage their symptoms and avoid behaviors like risky alcohol use when confronted with stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Nora Elizabeth Charles,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-CA0-ACA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-CA0-ACA,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T17:30:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; stress; covid-19; depression; coronavirus; young adults; mental health; alcohol,False
138,Neurotic coronavirus generation? The report from the second wave of research on the students from Kraków,"The report presents the results of the second wave of research conducted among the students of the Pedagogical University of Kraków. The research method was an on-line survey (CAWI) on the sample of 1927 respondents. The comparison of responses from both surveys indicates that the change in attitudes and mental condition of the respondents occurred. After almost three months of quarantine the youth is less interested in the pandemic, has lower fear of the coronavirus, evaluates the actions taken by government to combat the pandemic worse. A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education. Mental tiredness, decreased efficiency of actions and a decrease in motivation for learning are observed as well.",Piotr Długosz,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-E0E-2A3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-E0E-2A3,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T10:06:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; fear; youth; covid-19; poland; stress,False
139,Further to the left. Stress-induced increase of spatial pseudoneglect during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Background The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the lockdown in Italy, do impact psychological health; yet, less is known about their effect on cognitive functioning. The transactional theory of stress predicts reciprocal influences between perceived stress and cognitive performance. However, the effects of a period of stress due to social isolation on spatial cognition and exploration have been little examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effects and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on spatial cognition tasks, particularly those concerning spatial exploration, and the physiological leftward bias known as pseudoneglect. A right-hemisphere asymmetry for spatial attention processes crucially contributes to pseudoneglect. Other evidence indicates a predominantly right-hemisphere activity in stressful situations. We also analyzed the effects of lockdown on coping strategies, which typically show an opposite pattern of hemispheric asymmetry, favoring the left hemisphere. If so, then pseudoneglect should increase during the lockdown and be negatively correlated with the efficacy of coping strategies. Methods One week before the start of the lockdown due to Covid-19 in Italy (T1), we had collected data from a battery of behavioral tests including tasks of peri-personal spatial cognition. During the quarantine period, from late April to early May 2020 (T2), we repeated the testing sessions with a subgroup of the same participants (47 right-handed students, mean age = 20, SD = 1.33). At both testing sessions, participants performed digitized neuropsychological tests, including a cancellation task, radial arm maze task and Raven’s advanced progressive matrices. Participants also completed a newly developed COVID-19 Student Stress Scale, based on transactional models of stress, and the COPE-NIV to assess coping orientation. Results The tendency to start cancellation from a left-sided item, to explore first a left-sided arm of the maze, and to choose erroneous response items on the left side of the page on Raven’s matrices, increased from T1 to T2. The degree of pseudoneglect increment positively correlated with perceived stress, and negatively correlated with Positive Attitude and Problem-Solving COPE-NIV subscales. Conclusions Lockdown-related stress may have contributed to increase leftward bias during quarantine through a greater activation of the right hemisphere. On the other hand, pseudoneglect was decreased for better coping participants, perhaps as a consequence of a more balanced hemispheric activity in these individuals.",Federica Somma et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-36C-20E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-36C-20E,2020-06-17,2020-06-17T05:37:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Attention,False
140,Cohort Profile: Chinese Color Nest Project,"The ongoing CCNP was established to plot normative growth curves for brain structure and function across the human lifespan, and link age-related changes in brain imaging measures with psycho-behavioral functions at the behavioral, cognitive and emotional levels using an accelerated longitudinal design. It comprises three phases: developmental CCNP (devCCNP: 6-20 years), standardizing CCNP (stdCCNP: 20-60 years) and aging CCNP (ageCCNP: 60-90 years). The devCCNP started in 2013 and has successfully acquired CCNP-SWU data with three repeated measurements ( the trial stage of devCCNP), and accumulated CCNP-CAS baseline data (the second stage of devCCNP). CCNP-SWU consists of 201 age-sex stratified schoolchildren at enrollment (100 children followed up for 2.5 years at 1.25-year intervals) while CCNP-CAS has been recruiting participants since July 2018, and has collected data from 133 eligible children so far. A T1-weighted MRI and two resting functional MRI scans were acquired across three waves in CCNP-SWU with the same imaging protocols on a Siemens Trio 3T scanner at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. CCNP-SWU obtained longitudinal biophysical, social, behavioral and cognitive data via parent-reported questionnaires, self-reported questionnaires, behavioral assessment, as well as E-Prime computer tasks. Data were collected on the impact of COVID-19 on children’s learning and daily life from 46 children between March and May 2020.

141,Priming reasoning increases intentions to wear a face covering to slow down COVID-19 transmission,"Finding mechanisms to promote the use of face masks is fundamental during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic response, when shelter-in-place rules are relaxed and some segments of the population are allowed to circulate more freely. Here we report three pre-registered studies (total N = 1,920), using an heterogenous sample of people living in the USA, showing that priming people to “rely on their reasoning” rather than to “rely on their emotions” significantly increases their intentions to wear a face covering. Compared to the baseline, priming reasoning promotes intentions to wear a face covering, whereas priming emotion has no significant effect. These findings have theoretical and practical implications. Practically, they offer a simple and scalable intervention to promote intentions to wear a face mask.

142,Compliance in the 1.5 Meter Society: Longitudinal Analysis of Citizens’ Adherence to COVID-19 Mitigation Measures in a Representative Sample in the Netherlands,"In the month of May, the Netherlands moved out of the “intelligent lockdown”, and into the “1.5 meter society”, which aims to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic by means of safe-distance measures. This paper assesses how Dutch citizens have complied with these social distancing measures. It analyses data from two surveys conducted in May (between 8-14 and between 22-26) among nationally representative samples (N = 984 and N = 1021). We find that a combination of factors explain social distancing compliance. On the one hand we see that people are more likely to comply if they have an intrinsic motivation to do so, when they have the capacity to comply, when they have good impulse control, when they think compliance is normal, and when they see a general duty to obey rules generally. The paper also assesses how compliance has changed over time, assessing changes in May as well as how these are different from compliance with lockdown measures in April. During this period, there has been a gradual decline in compliance that coincides with a decline in intrinsic motivations and capacity for compliance, and there has been an increase in opportunities to violate the measures. The paper assesses what these changes may mean for current and future success of Covid-19 mitigation measures.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46160-FEE-A7E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46160-FEE-A7E,2020-06-15,2020-06-16T07:24:51+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; trust in science; deterrence; safe distance measures; 1.5 meter society; compliance; emotions; intelligent lockdown; obligation to obey the law; covid-19; netherlands; social norms; political orientation; public health; procedural justice; social distancing; impulsivity; trust in media",False
143,Well-Being and COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beings’ livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship between people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Method: 222 participants (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of well-being and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. Results: The results showed that people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants’ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: People’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and people’s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety.

We created a novel, five-minute online educational intervention, leveraging evidence-based cognitive science research, to encourage accurate COVID-19 and flu fatality rate calculations and comparisons. As predicted, adults (N = 1,297) randomly assigned to the intervention were more likely to correctly answer health decision-making problems and were less likely to report WNB errors in their problem-solving strategies relative to control participants. There were no immediate effects of condition on COVID-19 risk perceptions and worry; however, those in the intervention group did exhibit increased perceived risk and worry across 10 days of daily diaries.

145,"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.",Jeffrey Wardell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593,2020-06-15,2020-06-16T05:01:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; drinking motives; social distancing; coronavirus; parent; covid-19; drinking alone; stress; income; alcohol problems; alcohol; solitary drinking; coping; depression; social isolation,False
146,"Therapeutic alliance, social inclusion and infection control - Towards pandemic-adapted mental health care services in Switzerland","The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the Swiss mental health care system. Many services were downsized or closed and admission to treatment and care institutions was restricted. While these measures were necessary according to the general containment and mitigation strategies of federal and cantonal authorities, this situation has had negative consequences for care and treatment of service users.

147,Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.",Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46214-0AD-065,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46214-0AD-065,2020-06-14,2020-06-14T17:59:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; mental health; public; mental morbidities; primary prevention; keywords: mental health; psychological morbidities; coping strategies; health information; health promotion,False
148,Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales. On the other hand, daily physical activity was found to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Results indicate that people with social anxiety might be especially vulnerable to the development of other mental disorders after the relaxation of the confinement measures.",Álvaro Planchuelo-Gómez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-16D-42D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-16D-42D,2020-06-10,2020-06-14T08:11:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depression; covid-19; longitudinal; anxiety; posttraumatic stress disorder; stress,False
149,Perceived Risk and Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Resilience and Coronavirus Fear,"During coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were particularly at high-risk of developing symptoms of mental health problems due to being on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19. This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as critical mechanism that explain the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.",Murat Yıldırım et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B,2020-06-10,2020-06-12T18:32:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19 perceived risk; covid-19; resilience; mental health problems; healthcare professionals; covid-19 fear,False
150,Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention,"The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001). On average, differences in their perceived ability to handle lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic were positive, but small and at the level of a nonsignificant trend (dav=0.13, dz=0.14, p=0.066).

151,Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants were drawn from the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS or Understanding Society), a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. Participants were 12,074 men and women with a mean age of 51.6 (range 18-95) who took part in the representative wave 9 (2017–2019) sample of the UKHLS and were followed-up between the 24–30th of April 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Results The percentage of participants experiencing mental health problems (GHQ-12 score ≥3) increased from 23.4% in 2017–2019 to 37.1% in April, 2020. All population subgroups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems. The increase was 9.8% (95% CI [5.4%–14.3%]) greater among those aged 18-34 compared to those aged 50–64, 7.4% (95% CI [4.9%–9.9%]) greater in females compared to males, and 3.6% (95% CI [1.1%–6.1%]) greater amongst those with a degree compared to others. Additional analyses showed that the substantial rise in mental health problems in April, 2020 was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation.

152,"An overview of the context, design and conduct of the first two waves of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study","The C19PRC Study aims to assess the psychological, social, and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, Republic of Ireland, and Spain. This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample.

153,Mood Symptoms Predict COVID-19 Pandemic Distress but not Vice Versa: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale and was argued to have negatively impacted the population’s mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity.

154,Preparing for a COVID-19 vaccine: Identifying and psychologically profiling those who are vaccine hesitant or resistant in two general population samples,"Successful delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine may be undermined if populations are not receptive to inoculation as a primary public health strategy for combatting the virus. We gathered nationally representative data from the general adult populations of Ireland (N=1,041) and the United Kingdom (UK; N=2,025) to determine rates of hesitancy and resistance to a future COVID-19 vaccine and to identify and psychologically profile vaccine hesitant/resistant individuals in a way that might aid future public health messaging. Vaccine hesitancy was evident for 26% and 25% of Irish and UK samples, respectively, while vaccine resistance was evident for 9% and 6%, respectively. Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed in relation to a number of sociodemographic, political, and health-related variables, but were similar across a broad array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those who were resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources. The current findings may help public health officials to more effectively target vaccine hesitant and resistant individuals, develop effective communication strategies that take into account their specific psychological dispositions, and leverage dissemination channels that can successfully reach these individuals.",Jamie Murphy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B9C-60B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B9C-60B,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:02:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; public health messaging; psychology; covid-19; vaccine,False
155,Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology,"Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.",Asle Hoffart et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:02:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety,False
156,COVID Feel Good – An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus,"Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.",Giuseppe Riva et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE,2020-06-10,2020-06-11T05:01:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19,False
157,"Coronavirus Stress, Meaningful Living, Optimism, and Depressive Symptoms: A Study of Moderated Mediation Model","In the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to public mental health stress, anxiety, panic, and behavioral disorders. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether meaning in life mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms and whether the mediating effect of meaning in life on depressive symptoms was moderated by optimism. The sample of the study included 475 undergraduate students attending a public university in an urban city of Turkey. They were 69.2% female, ranged in age between 18 and 34 years (M = 20.63, SD = 1.99). Results showed that meaning in life and optimism–pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Optimism also mediated the relationship between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, optimism moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life in the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. These results indicated that the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms can be better understood by meaning in life and optimism.

158,"Meaningful Living, Resilience, Affective Balance, and Psychological Health Problems during COVID-19","The present study sought to investigate the mediating effect of the affective balance and resilience on the association between meaningful living and psychological health problems among Turkish young adults in the context of pandemic. Participants were 359 Turkish young adults, comprising of primarily female (68.2%), and their age ranged between 18 to 43 (age M = 20.67, SD = 3.62). Findings from this study indicated that meaningful living had a positive predictive effect on resilience and positive affect, as well as a negative predicative on psychological health challenges and negative affect. Resilience and affective balance also mediated the effect of meaningful living on psychological health of young adults. These results suggest that resilience and affective balance are important aspects of implementing meaning-based preventions and interventions.

159,Wearing face masks strongly confuses counterparts in reading emotions,"Wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Although acceptance of such masks increases in the Western hemisphere, many people feel that social interaction is affected by wearing a mask. In the present experiment, we tested the impact of face masks on the readability of emotions. The participants (N=41, calculated by an a priori power test; random sample; healthy persons of different ages, 18-87 years) assessed the emotional expressions displayed by twelve different faces. Each face was randomly presented with six different expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad) while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. Lower accuracy and lower confidence in one’s own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. We further detected specific confusion patterns, mostly pronounced in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry plus assessing many other emotions (e.g. happy, sad and angry) as neutral.

160,State-level Stay-at-home Orders and Objectively Measured Movement in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19. State-wide stay-at-home orders received a large degree of attention as a public health intervention to increase social distancing, but relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the extent to which stay-at-home orders affected people’s behavior. Method: This study used GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. Results: From the first week of March to the first week of April, people in counties within states that enacted stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states that did not enact state-level stay-at-home orders. From the first week of April to the first week of May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place. The magnitude of change in movement associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total change in movement across all counties over the same periods of time in both cases. Conclusions: Stay-at-home orders are likely insufficient to reduce people’s movement outside the home without additional public health actions. Existing research on behavior change would be useful to determine what additional interventions could support social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic if becomes necessary to reduce movement in the future.",Kyle J.

The study examined a range of social and behavioural responses by youth from different ethnic backgrounds and across 63 cities (N = 569). More specifically, the study focused on investigating the relationship between threat perceptions, public health behaviours, stress and social cohesion. As expected, results indicate that higher perceptions of threat were related to higher compliance to safety and health measures despite extremely extremely low levels of political trust. Surprisingly, participants reported relatively low levels of stress despite high social isolation and physical restrictions. These results could partially be explained by an increased level of family interactions. Furthermore, participants reported relatively high levels of social cohesion and common-ingroup identification in a usually segregated and conflict-ridden context.",Ana Jankovic et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46122-A88-E8C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46122-A88-E8C,2020-06-10,2020-06-10T06:49:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
162,Somatisation and COVID-19 related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder symptoms: The role of hyperarousal,"Objective: Somatisation is commonly associated with histories of trauma and PTSD symptoms. Although previous research has demonstrated that PTSD symptoms predict somatic symptoms, there has been no systematic examination of this at the level of symptom clusters for COVID-19 related PTSD and multi-dimensional assessment of somatic symptoms. It was aimed to test for an association between ICD-11 PTSD symptom clusters, with COVID-19 as the stressor, and somatic symptoms while controlling for potentially confounding variables. Methods: Participants were a nationally representative sample of 1,041 adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland. Physical health problems across the domains of pain, gastrointestinal, cardiopulmonary, and fatigue were assessed by the PHQ and PTSD symptoms were assessed with the ITQ. Descriptive analyses were undertaken and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted controlling for potentially confounding variables. Results: All ICD-11 PTSD symptom clusters predicted the presence of pain, fatigue, gastro-intestinal, and cardiovascular symptoms in the PHQ. Sense of Threat individually predicted all physical health variables, and Avoidance predicted pain. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the key role of sense of threat in the presence of COVID-19 trauma and somatisation. Findings suggest that interventions that tackle sense of threat might provide relief from somatisation.",Philip Hyland et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-F24-2CE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-F24-2CE,2020-06-08,2020-06-09T05:07:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology,False
163,A look at the first quarantined community in the United States: Response of religious communal organizations and implications for public health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The current study examined anxiety and distress among members of the first community to be quarantined in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to being historically significant, the current sample was unusual in that those quarantined were all members of a Modern Orthodox Jewish community and were connected via religious institutions at which exposure may have occurred. We sought to explore the community and religious factors unique to this sample, as they relate to the psychological and public health impact of quarantine. Community organizations were trusted more than any other source of COVID 19-related information, including federal, state, and other government agencies, including the CDC, WHO and media news sources. This was supported qualitatively with open-ended responses in which participants described the range of supports organized by community organizations. These included tangible needs (i.e. food delivery), social support, virtual religious services, and dissemination of COVID-19 related information. The overall levels of distress and anxiety were elevated and directly associated with what was reported to be largely inadequate and inconsistent health related information received from local departments of health. In addition, the majority of participants felt that perception of or concern about future stigma related to a COVID-19 diagnosis or association of COVID-19 with the Jewish community was high and also significantly predicted distress and anxiety. The current study demonstrates the ways in which religious institutions can play a vital role in promoting the well-being of their constituents. During this unprecedented pandemic, public health authorities have an opportunity to form partnerships with religious institutions in the common interests of promoting health, relaying accurate information and supporting the psychosocial needs of community members, as well as protecting communities against stigma and discrimination.",Sarah L.
