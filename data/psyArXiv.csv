0,Surfacing norms to increase vaccine acceptance,"Despite the availability of multiple safe vaccines, vaccine hesitancy may present a challenge to successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic. As with many human behaviors, people’s vaccine acceptance may be affected by their beliefs about whether others will accept a vaccine (i.e., descriptive norms). However, information about these descriptive norms may have different effects depending on people’s baseline beliefs and the relative importance of conformity, social learning, and free-riding. Here, using a large, pre-registered, randomized experiment (N=437,236) embedded in an international survey, we show that accurate information about descriptive norms can substantially increase intentions to accept a vaccine for COVID-19. These positive effects (e.g., reducing by 5.3% the fraction of people who are “unsure” or more negative about accepting a vaccine) are largely consistent across the 23 included countries, but are concentrated among people who were otherwise uncertain about accepting a vaccine. Providing this normative information in vaccine communications partially corrects individuals’ apparent underestimation of how many other people will accept a vaccine. These results suggest that public health communications should present information about the widespread and growing intentions to accept COVID-19 vaccines.",Alex Moehring et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F8-8A8-60D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F8-8A8-60D,2021-02-08,2021-03-19T14:57:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interventions; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; social norms; descriptive norms; public health; free-riding; international; vaccine hesitancy; covid-19; survey; social influence,False
1,"The Relationship between Interoceptive Sensitivity, Age, and COVID-19 Anxiety During the First National Lockdown in the United Kingdom","Interoception refers to the multidimensional representation of the internal states of the body, including their sensation, appraisal, integration, and regulation. COVID-19 targets internal respiratory, temperature and gastrointestinal systems, thus posing a primary threat to humans that causes anxiety. Here, we examined the relationship between the sensitivity to internal bodily states and COVID-19 anxiety during the first national lockdown in the UK, when uncertainties surrounding the virus were at their peak. Between April and July 2020, N=232 individuals across 6 age-categories completed questionnaires measuring interoceptive sensibility (BPQ-SF and MAIA-2) and COVID-19 anxiety (adapted STAI). Several significant relationships suggested that the heightened sensation and the noticing of bodily signals were associated with higher COVID-19 anxiety, while healthy appraisal, attention regulation, mind-body integration and trusting of bodily signals were related to lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Age was associated with changes across multiple interoceptive dimensions and was related to lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Regression results further revealed that, after controlling for trait anxiety, higher age significantly predicted lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety, and a lower score on the Not Worrying subscale significantly predicted higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Our results extend previous findings of an age-related decline in COVID-19 anxiety to suggest underlying biopsychological changes in interoception. Interoceptive sensitivity may significantly influence anxiety management and regulate adaptive behaviour in the presence of health threats. Age-related interoceptive changes therefore raise important questions about best-practice guidance for individuals across the lifespan in protecting their own and other’s physical and mental health during a pandemic.",Jennifer Elliott et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-D7B-59C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-D7B-59C,2021-03-19,2021-03-19T11:56:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; anxiety; pandemic; interoception; mental health; covid-19; aving,False
2,"Risk perception, Unhealthy Behavior, and Anxiety due to Viral Epidemic among Healthcare Workers: The Relationships with Depressive and Insomnia symptoms during COVID-19","We aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors among healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers’ perception regarding COVID-19 exposure in a work unit. Workers’ depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-9 (SAVE-9) scale. We found that work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was associated with female sex, perception of the workplace as being dangerous, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were associated with male sex, young age, depression, and insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to closely observe the patterns of work-related stress and anxiety reactions among healthcare workers to reduce their burnout.",Ju Kab Lee et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-70E-E8B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-70E-E8B,2020-10-07,2021-03-19T05:22:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; health personnel; occupational stress; save-9; covid-19,False
3,Expert Predictions of Societal Change: Insights from the World after COVID Project,"How will the world change after the COVID-19 pandemic? Is there a consensus on the most significant psychological and societal changes ahead? To answer these questions, we analyzed interviews from the World after COVID project – reflections of more than 50 of the world’s top behavioral and social science experts, including fellows of National Academies and presidents of major scientific societies. These experts independently shared their thoughts on what societal shifts would emerge after the COVID-19 pandemic and provided advice for how to respond to new challenges and opportunities these changes may bring. Using mixed-method and natural language processing analyses, we distilled and analyzed these predictions and suggestions. Most predictions were unique, not statistically reducible to broader categories, and most themes were mentioned by fewer than 10% of experts. Half of the experts approached their post-COVID predictions dialectically, highlighting both positive and negative features of the same domain of change. The project provides a time capsule of experts’ predictions for the effects of the pandemic on a wide range of outcomes. We discuss the implications of heterogeneity in these predictions, the value of uncertainty and dialecticism in forecasting, and the value of balancing explanations with predictions in expert psychological judgment.",Igor Grossmann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-324-C60,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-324-C60,2021-01-19,2021-03-19T02:57:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology|Multi-cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Theory and Philosophy of Science; dialecticism; uncertainty; expert judgment; wisdom; covid19; cultural change; forecasting,False
4,"Associations among anxiety, risk perception, preventive behaviors, and personality in Japanese older adults aged 78 to 99 years during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and Objectives: To deepen the understanding of processes underlying older adults’ behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated associations among affective (anxiety about the coronavirus), cognitive (perceived risk of infection and fatality), and behavioral (engagement in preventive behaviors) variables. We also examined how these variables were predicted by personality traits measured before the pandemic. Research Design and Methods: Older adults (N = 1,727; 78–99 years old) were recruited from an ongoing longitudinal cohort study started in 2010. They responded to a questionnaire sent in August 2020, which included four items measuring COVID-19 anxiety, infection risk perception, fatality risk perception, and engagement in preventive behaviors. Big Five personality traits were measured years ago when the participants had first participated in the study. Results: Most participants felt anxious, engaged in preventive behaviors, and overestimated infection and fatality risks. Older age was associated with low anxiety, a low perception of infection risk, a high perception of fatality risk, and a little engagement in preventive behaviors. Women were more susceptible to the pandemic than men were, demonstrated by higher scores on all four items. Partial correlation analysis controlling for age and sex demonstrated positive associations among all four items except for infection risk perception and preventive behaviors. Anxiety and perceived infection risk were positively predicted by neuroticism and conscientiousness, respectively. Engagement in preventive behaviors was positively predicted by extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness. Discussion and Implications: We highlighted the critical distinction between infection and fatality risk perceptions and demonstrated the need to consider each individual’s attributes.",Hiroyuki Muto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46243-E7F-ED8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46243-E7F-ED8,2021-03-15,2021-03-19T01:57:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Aging; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; infection risk perception; aging; preventive behaviors; fatality risk perception; big five; new normal; personality; covid-19; pandemic; sonic study; gender differences,False
5,Mental Health and Behavior of College Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study - Part II,"Background: Since late 2019, the lives of people across the globe have been disrupted by COVID-19. Millions of people have become infected; billions have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes, but few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals. Objectives: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the pandemic, measured by search term interest in ""coronavirus"" and ""covid fatigue"" across the United States. Methods: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs), including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. Results: Linear mixed models observed differences in phone usage, sleep, sedentary time and the number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in covid fatigue. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone usage, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (_P_<.001) were significantly associated with interest in covid fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020 [@Huckins2020]. Conclusions: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Though unsurprising, understanding these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic.",Dante Mack et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46041-E53-EDD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46041-E53-EDD,2021-03-17,2021-03-18T22:23:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; mobile sensing; depression; covid fatigue; sedentary; sleep; college; george floyd; google trends; covid-19; phone usage; anxiety; ema,False
6,Cultural influence on COVID-19 cognitions and growth speed: the role of cultural collectivism,"Many challenges faced by humans require large-scale cooperation for communal benefits. We examined what motivates such cooperation in the context of social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the transmission intensity of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We hypothesized that collectivism, a cultural variable characterizing the extent that individuals see themselves in relation to others, contributes to people’s willingness to engage in these behaviors. Consistent with preregistered predictions, across three studies (n=2864), including a U.S. nationally representative sample, people’s collectivist orientation is positively associated with intentions, positive beliefs, norm perceptions, and policy support for the preventive behaviors. In separate analyses at the country level (n=69 countries), more collectivist countries demonstrated lower growth rate in both COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Together, these studies demonstrate the positive role of collectivism at the individual- and country-level in reducing COVID-19 transmission, and highlight the need to consider culture in public health policies and communications.",Rui Pei et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-4BB-402,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-4BB-402,2020-12-15,2021-03-18T20:48:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences,False
7,Did the suspension of the AstraZeneca-vaccine decrease vaccine acceptance?,"The decision to temporarily suspend the AstraZeneca vaccine against COVID-19 raised debate about the suspension's potential effects on the levels of acceptance of the overall vaccination program against COVID-19. Here, we trace the impact of first the Danish decision and subsequent national decisions on general COVID-19 vaccine acceptance by comparing levels of acceptance on different specific dates in eight countries. Overall, the findings suggest that the Danish decision to suspend the vaccine may have had (at least, short-term) cross-national ripple effects on acceptance of a vaccine against COVID-19. Importantly, these adverse ripple effects were specific for individuals within countries that are most closely tied to the same informational eco-system as Denmark (i.e., other Western European countries). These countries (in particular, Italy) may furthermore have been negatively affected twice following both the Danish and the national suspension decisions. This raises the possibility that the decision to suspend vaccines following adverse events poses a collective action problem and highlights the importance of coordination between national health authorities.",Michael Bang Petersen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46231-FD1-8A8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46231-FD1-8A8,2021-03-18,2021-03-18T19:54:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; vaccine acceptance; astrazeneca; suspension; covid-19,False
8,Direct Human-AI Comparison in the Animal-AI Environment,"Artificial Intelligence is making rapid and remarkable progress in the development of more sophisticated and powerful systems. However, the acknowledgement of several problems with modern machine learning approaches has prompted a shift in AI benchmarking away from task-oriented testing (such as Chess and Go) towards ability-oriented testing, in which AI systems are tested on their capacity to solve certain kinds of novel problems. The Animal-AI Environment is one such benchmark which aims to apply the ability-oriented testing used in comparative psychology to AI systems. Here, we present the first direct human-AI comparison in the Animal-AI Environment, using children aged 6–10 (n=52). We found that children of all ages were significantly better than a sample of 30 AIs across most of the tests we examined, as well as performing significantly better than the two top-scoring AIs, ‘ironbar’ and ‘Trrrrr’, from the Animal-AI Olympics Competition 2019. While children and AIs performed similarly on basic navigational tasks, AIs performed significantly worse in more complex cognitive tests, including detour tasks, spatial elimination tasks, and object permanence tasks, indicating that AIs lack several cognitive abilities that children aged 6–10 possess. Both children and AIs performed poorly on tool-use tasks, suggesting that these tests are challenging for both biological and non-biological machines.",Konstantinos Voudouris et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A5-6AF-38D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A5-6AF-38D,2021-03-18,2021-03-18T19:53:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Learning and Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Problem Solving; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Reasoning; out-of-distribution testing; animal-ai olympics; cognitive ai; comparative cognition; artificial intelligence; ai benchmarking; human-ai comparison,False
9,Risk perception as a double-edged sword in policy compliance in COVID-19 pandemic? A two-phase evaluation from Hong Kong,"The emphasis of risk has been recognized as a crucial component to effective and successful policy compliance amidst crisis. Yet, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the dreadfulness of the risk may fluctuate with the severity of the prolonged pandemic, and the nature of public health policy is not confined purely to public health concerns, perceived risk may not always lead to policy compliance. Two surveys (during almost zero case period and during the biggest outbreak) were conducted to examine the dichotomous role of perceived risk and perceived susceptibility in influencing policy compliance in Hong Kong. Although policy compliance increases with the scale of the outbreak, results from path analysis showed that perceived susceptibility and perceived severity have an indirect role in policy complying behaviour when the objective risk is low. Risk variables, such as attitude, knowledge, benefit and trust, have directly shaped policy compliance. More importantly, perceived severity of COVID-19 boosts policy compliance but perceived susceptibility was associated with disobedience to public health policy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong citizens have a selective and conscious preference in regard to the stringency of public health policy: they welcome more law and order, with increasing magnitude of penalty, but reject lockdown measures such as curfew. Regression results implied that demography had a mild contribution to public health policy stringency, with only the female gender being statistically related to higher policy acceptance. This study calls for further reflection on the role of risk, especially perceived susceptibility, in mobilizing policy compliance to COVID-19 related measures.",RIcci Yue et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618C-9FD-00F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618C-9FD-00F,2021-03-18,2021-03-18T19:49:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; covid; perceived susceptibility; perceived severity; policy; attitudes; risk,False
10,"Multilevel Associations of Daily Skill Use and Effectiveness With Anxiety, Stress, and Depression in a Transdiagnostic Sample Undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is effective at treating disorders of emotion dysregulation. However, it is unclear which mechanisms contribute to these effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the within-person associations of two theoretically relevant mechanisms of change, skill use and skill effectiveness, with anxiety, stress, and depression. Participants (n = 19, Mage = 31.8, 68% female) with a primary anxiety or depressive disorder completed daily reports (N = 1344) of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a 16-session DBT skills training group. DBT skill use increased across treatment, p < .01, but effectiveness did not, p = .64. Within persons, participants used more skills on days with greater stress and anxiety, p < .01, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety, p = .03. On days when participants reported higher effectiveness, they used more skills than their personal average when experiencing more intense negative affect, p < .01. These results suggest using more skills, especially when used more effectively, is a mechanism by which DBT skills groups address emotional dysfunction for those with transdiagnostic emotional disorders.",Matthew W.

11,Anti-Asian Discrimination and Antiracist Bystander Behaviors amid the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Anti-Asian racism is a public health concern, and it has escalated during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Bystanders—individuals who witness acts of racism—can help by discouraging perpetrations of discrimination (and other forms of interpersonal violence), offering help and support to victims, and reinforcing (antiracist) prosocial norms. Yet, little is known about who engages in antiracist bystander intervention behaviors in response to discriminatory events, and who engages in proactive bystander behaviors in general. In the current study, 456 US community adults of diverse ethnic backgrounds (18-85 years, Mage = 48.8, 52.0% women, 212 Asian Americans) reported on their experiences with discrimination, attitudes about the acceptability of discrimination, and engagement in proactive and reactive bystander behaviors. About 40% of the Asian American participants experienced COVID-related discrimination during a one-week period. Among individuals who witnessed anti-Asian discrimination during the COVID-19 outbreak, 45% of them engaged in any antiracist reactive bystander interventions. More frequent everyday discrimination experiences predicted greater odds of reactive bystander behaviors, over and above ethnicity, gender, and attitudes about the acceptability of discrimination. Initial evidence supported the utility of a new measure assessing bystander behaviors in response to racial discrimination. Prior exposure to discrimination may contribute to individuals’ active engagement in antiracist bystander behaviors. Future research directions on antiracist bystander actions and allyship are discussed.",P.

12,Learning it the hard way – how enjoying life and positive appraisal buffer the negative effects of stressors on mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background. Higher levels of stress and negative emotions such as anxiety and depression have been reported since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it remains less clear how positive emotions, such as hedonic capacity, may be affected. Further, during lockdowns, the ability to learn new pleasurable activities (hedonic learning) may be particularly relevant. Here, we investigated if state hedonia and/or hedonic learning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and mental health. Moreover, we explored whether positive appraisal style (PAS), a major resilience factor, influenced these relationships. Methods. Using a cross-sectional design, 5000 German-speaking participants filled out online questionnaires targeting stressors, mental health, state hedonia, hedonic learning, and PAS between April 9 and May 15, 2020. After confirming the factor structure of our constructs, we applied latent structural equation modeling to test mediation as well as moderated mediation models. Results. Stress showed a positive association with mental health symptoms, which was buffered by both state hedonia and hedonic learning. While higher stress was related to lower state hedonia, participants reported more hedonic learning with greater stressor load. The latter effect was greater for individuals with high PAS. Limitations. The present results should be replicated in longitudinal designs with representative samples to confirm the directionality and generalizability of effects. Conclusions. Both state hedonia and hedonic learning buffered the effect of stress on mental health in an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning new rewarding activities in combination with a PAS may be especially relevant for maintaining mental health during lockdowns.",Anna Daniels et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-065-C75,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-065-C75,2021-03-17,2021-03-17T14:11:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; anhedonia; reward learning; mental health; covid-19; positive appraisal; stress,False
13,"Brexit, COVID-19 and Attitudes Towards Immigration in Britain","A key issue in Britain’s referendum on European Union membership was the free movement of labour into Britain, with Brexit ‘Leavers’ having more negative attitudes towards immigrants compared to ‘Remainers’. Such anti-immigrant attitudes are driven by feelings of threat. As Brexit negotiations continued, the coronavirus pandemic presented a new threat, potentially heightening anti-immigrant attitudes. However, the prominent sacrifices of migrant workers in the fight against coronavirus suggests a potential for softening public attitudes. We ask: how did the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of ongoing Brexit negotiations, affected anti-immigrant attitudes and how did these effects differ between Leavers and Remainers? Through a survey experiment, we test the effects of priming COVID-19 thoughts, showing that COVID-19 may exacerbate anti-immigrant attitudes among Leavers while having little effect on Remainers. In doing so, we explore the effect of a viral threat on immigration attitudes and heterogeneity in that effect, based on political identities.",Mark Pickup et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46026-5CE-2FA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46026-5CE-2FA,2021-03-17,2021-03-17T00:37:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
14,An ethnopsychological ABC framework of psychiatric morbidity to facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions in Nepal,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be overwhelming leading to strong emotions and distress. Most studies reported the impact on mental health due to uncertainty, fear, and anxiety about the pandemic and post pandemic states. The sufferers may present with a variety of symptoms of psychological distress. Failure to communicate this psychosocial distress between lay and health care providers may pose barriers to treatment and challenges for integration of mental health into primary health centers. There is a need for tools to screen and explain pandemic associated distress in a way that attending physician can communicate with laymen in a coherent way. The article introduces an ethnopsychologial ABC framework that individual in distress can better understand the nature of the illness. Rather than providing a diagnosis to inexperienced clients of psychiatric morbidity, this method promotes improved communication and bridge the observed gaps. Thus, it helps to raise awareness of the relationship between cultural, emotional, thought, behavior, and psychosocial distress. This article discussed the assessment of the ABC framework with ethnopsycholgical premises and psychotherapeutic intervention at different levels that can be applied.",Dhirendra Paudel,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46134-029-1A1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46134-029-1A1,2021-03-16,2021-03-16T21:42:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Process; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Situation; ethnopsychology; mental disorders; abc; psychotherapy; psychology,False
15,Sleeping for Two: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in pregnant women,"Insomnia and sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and have potentially significant consequences for both maternal and infant health. There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The primary aim of the trial is to evaluate the impact of in-person or telehealth cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) versus a treatment as usual (TAU) control group in reducing symptoms of insomnia experienced in pregnancy. We hypothesize that participants who receive CBT-I delivered in person or via telehealth will report fewer insomnia symptoms. The secondary aims are to investigate if CBT-I versus TAU increases gestational length and reduces symptoms of depression. We hypothesize that receiving CBT-I will be associated with longer gestational length (as confirmed by public health records) and lower depressive symptoms.",Anna L.

16,PREDICTORS OF MENTAL HEALTH AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN POLAND,"The aim of the article is to determine the predictors of mental health among Polish society. Research was conducted after the first wave of the pandemic. Due to such an approach, it was possible to determine whether secondary effects of the pandemic have impact on mental health, apart from socio-demographic and psychological factors. In order to gather the research material, the CAWI on-line survey method was applied and carried out within the framework of the Ariadna Research Panel on the sample of 1079 Poles aged 15 and over. The FCV-19S scale, which is used to measure the fear of COVID-19 was applied in the measurement. It is a verified diagnostic instrument used to measure mental health in a lot of countries. The results of a hierarchical regression analysis have shown that the factors which increase the level of fear of COVID-19 are demographic, social and psychological features as well as attitudes towards the pandemic.

17,Social consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs: Evidence from two studies in Slovakia,"One of the appeals of conspiracy theories in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, is that they provide a scapegoat – someone to blame for what has happened. By doing this, they increase distrust, negative feelings, and even hostility toward implicated actors, whether those are powerful social outgroups or one’s own government representatives. We report two studies to examine such social consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. In Study 1 (N = 501), we showed the distinct pattern of relationships between China-specific and generic COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs and prejudice and discrimination toward three social groups associated with the pandemic. In Study 2 (N = 1024), lowered trust in government regulations and increased hostility associated with the COVID-19 and generic conspiracy beliefs predicted justification of and willingness to engage in non-compliance with government regulations, violent attacks on 5G masts, and anti-government protests. Also, across both studies, increased exposure to information about COVID-19 was associated with endorsing fewer conspiracy theories, but it also brought about stronger feelings of anxiety and lack of control, which in turn contributed to higher conspiracy belief. We highlight the potential social problems associated with the wide-spread COVID-19 conspiracy theories as well as potential solutions to counteract them.",Jakub Šrol et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620A-978-882,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620A-978-882,2021-03-15,2021-03-16T13:35:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression; conspiracy theories; negative social consequences; covid-19; support for violence; prejudice,False
18,"A Systematic Review of the Evidence on Inflammation in Depressive Illness and Symptoms, in Chronic and End Stage Kidney Disease","Background Depressive illness and symptoms are known to be common in physical health problems and are present in at least a third of people with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal failure (CKD/ESKD). Depressive illness and symptoms in CKD/ESKD complicates care, is associated with a shorter life expectancy, and may arise in response to inflammation. Methods We undertook a systematic review of studies including measures of depression and inflammatory markers in CKD/ESKD. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO: CRD42019141305. Data base searches were completed in 2019 and repeated in May 2020. We assessed study quality, and undertook a narrative synthesis as well as meta-analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, examining associations between depressive states and inflammatory markers. Results There was significant heterogeneity in study quality, comorbidities, samples, depression measures, and study design, as well as in the specific measured inflammatory markers. Overall, there is some evidence for associations of IL6 and CRP with depressive illness and symptoms, with inconclusive or contradictory evidence for other inflammatory markers. There were few intervention studies. Studies of samples with physical comorbidity and higher rated quality were more likely to show positive associations. There were few longitudinal studies. Conclusions There is some evidence of inflammation being an important correlate of depressive illness and symptoms in the presence of physical health comorbidities. Better research designs are needed including a range of inflammatory markers.",Simone Jayakumar et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-F32-628,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-F32-628,2021-03-10,2021-03-16T08:39:51+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,False
19,Effects of COVID-19 Public Health Safety Measures on Births in Scotland between March and May 2020,"Objective: To combat the wide-spread transmission of COVID-19, many countries, including the United Kingdom, have imposed nationwide lockdowns. Little is known about how these public health safety measures affect pregnant mothers and their offspring. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 public health safety measures on births in Scotland. Study Design: Cohort Study Methods: Using routinely collected health data on pregnancy and birth in Scotland, this study compares all births (N = 11220) between March and May 2020 to births in the same period in 2018 (N = 12428) to investigate the potential negative effects of public health safety measures introduced in Scotland in spring 2020. Birth outcomes were compared using Mann-Whitney-U tests and chi-square tests. Results: Mothers giving birth during the pandemic tended to combine breastfeeding and formula-feeding rather than exclusively breastfeed or exclusively formula-feed, stayed in hospital for fewer days and more often had an epidural or a spinal anaesthetic compared to women giving birth in 2018. Conclusion: Overall, results suggest little impact of public health safety measures on birth outcomes. Further research is needed to explore the longer-term impacts of being born in the pandemic on both maternal mental health and child development.",Lydia Gabriela Speyer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-429-6BE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-429-6BE,2021-03-02,2021-03-16T08:33:09+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; maternal &amp; covid-19; child health; social-distancing,False
20,Modelling the complexity of pandemic-related lifestyle quality change and mental health: An analysis of a nationally representative UK general population sample,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way many individuals go about their daily lives. This study attempted to model the complexity of change in lifestyle quality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its context within the UK adult population. Methods: Data from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study (Wave 3, July 2020; N=1166) were utilised. A measure of COVID-19-related lifestyle change captured how individuals’ lifestyle quality had been altered as a consequence of the pandemic. Exploratory factor analysis and latent profile analysis were used to identify distinct lifestyle quality change subgroups, while multinomial logistic regression analysis was employed to describe class membership. Results: Five lifestyle dimensions, reflecting partner relationships, health, family and friend relations, personal and social activities, and work life were identified by the EFA, while seven classes characterised by distinct patterns of change across these dimensions emerged from the LPA: (1) Better overall (3.3%), (2) Worse except partner relations (6.0%), (3) Worse overall (2.5%), (4) Better relationships (9.5%), (5) Better except partner relations (4.3%), (6) No different (67.9%), and (7) Worse partner relations only (6.5%). Predictor variables differentiated membership of classes. Notably, classes 3 and 7 were associated with poorer mental health (COVID-19 related PTSD and suicidal ideation). Conclusions: Four months into the pandemic, most individuals’ lifestyle quality remained largely unaffected by the crisis. Concerningly however, a substantial minority (15%) experienced worsened lifestyles compared to before the pandemic. In particular, a pronounced deterioration in partner relations seemed to constitute the more severe pandemic-related lifestyle change.",Sarah Butter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-783-5A5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-783-5A5,2021-03-15,2021-03-15T22:45:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; uk; covid-19; latent variable modelling; lifestyle; mental health; relationships; pandemic,False
21,"Culture, COVID-19, and Collectivism: A Paradox of American Exceptionalism?","Do geographic differences in collectivism relate to COVID-19 case and death rates? And if so, would they also replicate across states within arguably the most individualistic country in the world—the United States? Further still, what role might the U.S.’s history of ethnic strife and race-based health disparities play in either reinforcing or undermining state-level relations between collectivism and COVID-19 rates? To answer these questions, we examined archival data from 98 countries (Study 1) and the 48 contiguous United States (Study 2) on country/state-level collectivism, COVID-19 case/death rates, relevant covariates (per-capita GDP, population density, spatial dependence), and in the U.S., percent of non-Whites. In Study 1, country-level collectivism negatively related to both cases (r = -.28) and deaths (r = -.40) in simple regressions; however, after controlling for covariates, the former became non-significant (rp = -.07), but the latter remained significant (rp = -.20). In Study 2, state-level collectivism positively related to both cases (r = .56) and deaths (r = .41) in simple regressions, and these relationships persisted after controlling for all covariates except race, where a state’s non-White population dominated all other predictors of COVID-19 cases (rp = .35) and deaths (rp = .31).

22,Family Still Matters: Human Social Motivation during a Global Pandemic,"How have people’s fundamental social motives changed during the COVID-19 pandemic? In data collected from 32 countries before the onset of the pandemic, we saw that a) people prioritized family-related motives (romantic relationship maintenance and kin care) over mate-acquisition motives (mate-seeking and breakup concern), and b) family-related motives were positively associated, whereas mate-acquisition motives were negatively associated, with subjective well-being (Ko et al., 2020). The pandemic involved massive changes in social arrangements – separation from friends and coworkers, and often enforced close contact with immediate family members. Did those changes in people’s social lives affect the relative priority of family-related motives and their relationship with well-being? Data collected from 28 countries during the pandemic shows that people’s disease avoidance motivation has increased as expected, but a) the relative prioritization of family-related motives over mate-acquisition motives remains unchanged, and b) family-related motives remain positively associated with well-being and mate-acquisition motives remain negatively associated. Given that human beings have, throughout history, relied on family bonds during recurring social upheavals, sometimes caused by infectious diseases, it may be unsurprising that the powerful motivations associated with family relationships have persisted even in the face of this historically unique disruption.",Cari Marie Pick et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46132-A90-543,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46132-A90-543,2021-03-09,2021-03-15T18:58:35+00:00,bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; life satisfaction; family; fundamental social motives; satisfaction with life; covid-19,False
23,Excessive Worrying as the Driving Force of Anxiety During the First COVID-19 Lockdown-Phase in Belgium,"Since the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020, the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has profoundly impacted public health and the economy worldwide. But there are not the only ones to be hit. The COVID-19 pandemic has also substantially altered mental health, with anxiety symptoms being one of the most frequently reported problems. Especially, the number of people reporting anxiety symptoms increased significantly during the first lockdown-phase compared to similar data collected before the pandemic. Yet, most of these studies relied on a unitary approach to anxiety, wherein its different constitutive features (i.e., symptoms) were tallied into one sum-score, thus ignoring any possibility of interactions between them. Therefore, in this study, we seek to map the associations between the core features of anxiety during the first weeks of the first Belgian COVID-19 lockdown-phase (n = 2,829). To do so, we implemented, in a preregistered fashion, two distinct computational network approaches: a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) and a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Despite their varying assumptions, constraints, and computational methods to determine nodes (i.e., the variables) and edges (i.e., the relations between them), both GGM and DAG pointed to excessive worrying as a node playing an especially influential role in the network system of the anxiety features. Altogether, our findings offer novel data-driven clues for the ongoing field's larger quest to elucidate, and eventually alleviate, the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Alexandre Heeren et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607D-C22-F29,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607D-C22-F29,2021-03-11,2021-03-15T16:11:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; covid-19; gad; pandemic; lockdown; worry; gaussian graphical model; anxiety; directed acyclic graph; network approach to psychopathology; psychopathology,False
24,Telephone-based Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery for depression: a pilot randomized clinical trial in isolated older adults during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objectives To shield vulnerable persons, particularly the eldery, during the Covid-19 pandemic governments around the world have adviced to use social distancing and self-isolation. Social isolation might put older adults at an increased risk for mental health problems such as depression. There is a need for brief, easy-accessible psychological treatments for depressive symptoms that can be delivered remotely. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of telephone-delivered Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery for the treatment of depressive symptoms in individuals 65 years and older living in isolation during the covid-19-pandemic. Methods In this open-label pilot randomized clinical trial, N = 41 individuals aged 65 years or older with clinically significant symptoms of depression were randomly assigned to either a Behavioral Activation with Mental Imagery treatment condition, or an Attention-Assessment control condition delivered over the telephone over a four week period. Results Depressive symptoms decreased more in the treatment condition compared to the control condition. At post treatment 2 out of 16 participants in the treatment condition met diagnostic criteria for depression compared to 9 out of 13 in the control condition. Most participants in the treatment condition were satisfied with the treatment and few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that behavioral activation with mental imagery delivered over the telephone is feasible, acceptable and potentially efficacious for the treatment of depressive symptoms in older individuals living in isolation.

25,Meeting 24-hour movement behavior guidelines in young children: Improved quantity estimation and self-regulation,"Children who exhibit challenging behaviors, including low self-regulation, inattention, and lack of inhibitory control, may miss out on learning opportunities and could even face expulsion. Although physical activity supports academic achievement and self-regulatory skills in older children, the relationship among physical activity, sleep, screen time, aspects of self-regulation, and early academic achievement remain underspecified during early childhood. The present study examined the associations among meeting 24-hour movement behavior recommendations set by the World Health Organization (2019) and young children’s self-regulation and quantity estimation skills in a sample of 123 children (n = 65 female; 4.9 ± 0.7 years). Meeting screen time recommendations alone, meeting physical activity recommendations in combination with either sleep or screen time recommendations, meeting more recommendations overall, and being active more days weekly were associated with superior quantity estimation. Meeting more guidelines and accruing more moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily related to better self-regulation. Moreover, self-regulation partially mediated the relationship between physical activity and quantity estimation. Our findings identify benefits for adopting specific physical activity guidelines for children (e.g., physical activity, screen time, and sleep duration) and perhaps integrating these into early learning standards for schools so both families and schools can support children’s capacity to meet 24-hr movement guidelines and thus support cognitive health. An active lifestyle in early childhood may support young children’s self-regulation and early educational outcomes, with physical activity promotion efforts during early childhood serving as a viable means to address growing expulsion rates in preschool-aged children.",Amanda Lee McGowan PhD et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-302-F88,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-302-F88,2021-03-13,2021-03-13T21:54:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; early numeracy; preschool expulsion; self-regulation; screen time; early childhood education; physical activity,False
26,"Social norms, social identities and the COVID-19 pandemic: Theory and recommendations","Sustained mass behaviour change is needed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, but many of the required changes run contrary to existing social norms (e.g., physical closeness with ingroup members). This paper explains how social norms and social identities are critical to explaining and changing public behaviour. Recommendations are presented for how to harness these social processes to maximise adherence to COVID-19 public health guidance. Specifically, we recommend that public health messages clearly define who the target group is, are framed as identity-affirming rather than identity-contradictory, include complementary injunctive and descriptive social norm information, are delivered by ingroup members and that support is provided to enable the public to perform the requested behaviours.",Fergus Gilmour Neville et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46129-453-CA6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46129-453-CA6,2021-03-12,2021-03-13T12:39:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; covid-19; behaviour change; leadership; social identities; social norms; coronavirus; pandemic,False

During the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns, access to early childhood education and care (ECEC) was disrupted. We investigate how this period affected the developmental advantages typically offered by ECEC. Using parent-report data from 189 families living in the UK, we explore associations between time spent in ECEC by 8-to-36-month-olds, their socioeconomic background, and their growth in language and executive functions between Spring and Winter 2020. Receptive vocabulary growth was greater in children who continued to attend ECEC during the period, with a stronger positive effect for children from less advantaged backgrounds.

28,Commonly reported problems and coping strategies during the COVID-19 crisis: A survey of graduate and professional students,"Background: The COVID-19 crisis has introduced a variety of stressors, while simultaneously decreasing the availability of strategies to cope with stress. In this context, it could be useful to understand issues that people find most concerning and ways in which they cope with stress. In this study, we explored these questions with a sample of graduate and professional students. Method: Using open-ended assessments, we asked participants (n=305) to identify their biggest challenge or concern (“top problem”), their most effective way of handling stress (“effective strategy”), and their most common way of handling stress (“common strategy”). We applied thematic analysis and evaluated whether participants’ strategies corresponded with evidence-based practices (EBPs). Results: Participants frequently reported top problems relating to productivity (27% of sample), physical health (26%), and emotional health (14%). Distraction was the most frequently classified common strategy (43%), whereas behavioral activation was the most frequently identified effective strategy (50%). Participants who reported a common strategy classified as an EBP reported lower depressive and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, there was no evidence of an association between symptom levels and whether or not participants’ effective strategy was an EBP. Participants who reported the same strategy as both their common and effective strategy (29%) reported lower depressive symptoms than those whose common and effective strategies were different. Conclusions: Our findings highlight stressors that students are experiencing and ways they are coping during the COVID-19 crisis.

29,Infection control in the home: A qualitative study exploring perceptions and experiences of adhering to protective behaviours in the home during the COVID-19 pandemic,"We sought to explore people’s perceptions of adhering to infection control behaviours in the home during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to increase our understanding of adherence, and to inform the adaptation of an online behavioural intervention called Germ Defence. Thirteen participants completed thinkaloud interviews. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The interviews were triangulated with open-ended survey data from 124 participants. Thematic analysis generated 7 themes; perceived risk, belief in the efficacy of protective behaviours, acceptability of the behaviours, having capacity to perform the behaviours, habit forming reduces effort involved in the behaviours, having the confidence to perform the behaviours, and social norms affecting motivation to engage in the behaviours. Behaviours such as isolating and social distancing at home were identified as less acceptable than cleaning and handwashing, influenced by the need for connection and intimacy with other household members. This was especially true in the absence of symptoms and when levels of perceived risk were low. People felt more empowered when they understood that even small changes, such as spending some time apart, were worthwhile in order to reduce exposure and lessen viral load. The current study provided valuable insight into the acceptability and feasibility of the protective behaviours, and how behavioural guidelines could be presented to the public during a pandemic.

30,"Protocol of the COVID-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) study: understanding changes in adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours, mental and general health, in repeated cross-sectional representative survey of the Scottish population. THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN PEER-REVIEWED AND PUBLISHED, AVAILABLE AT http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044135","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has unprecedented consequences on population health, with governments worldwide issuing public health directives which have major impacts on normal living. In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, regular hand washing, and wearing face covering, especially when physical distancing is difficult. The application of behavioural science is central to understanding factors that influence adherence to TRBs. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people’s mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs, explain variations in adherence, and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Repeated 20-minute structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults from throughout Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes, and questions that align with the evolving pandemic. Discussion This study will provide insights into the link between (changes in) adherence to TRBs and explanatory factors, and their effects on mental and general health, including event-related changes (e.g., when government directives change). Governments and other decision-makers may use these findings to tailor public health promotion, target specific population groups, and develop behaviourally informed interventions over the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (along with any subsequent equivalent events) to protect health and limit the spread of COVID-19.",Chantal den Daas et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-C48-828,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-C48-828,2020-08-19,2021-03-12T12:52:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
31,Oscillatory correlates of selective restudy,"Prior behavioral work has shown that selective restudy of some studied items leaves recall of the other studied items unaffected when lag between study and restudy is short, but improves recall of the other items when lag is prolonged. The beneficial effect has been attributed to context retrieval, assuming that selective restudy reactivates the context at study and thus provides a retrieval cue for the other items (Bäuml, 2019). Here the results of two experiments are reported, in each of which subjects studied a list of items and then, after a short 2-min or a prolonged 10-min lag, restudied some of the list items. Participants’ electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during both the study and restudy phases. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, subjects engaged in a mental context reinstatement task immediately before the restudy phase started, trying to mentally reinstate the study context. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a theta/alpha power increase from study to restudy after short lag and an alpha/beta power decrease after long lag. Engagement in the mental context reinstatement task in Experiment 2 eliminated the decrease in alpha/beta power. The results are consistent with the view that the observed alpha/beta decrease reflects context retrieval, which became obsolete when there was preceding mental context reinstatement.",Michael Wirth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-05A-8A9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B9-05A-8A9,2021-03-12,2021-03-12T11:57:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; brain oscillations; context retrieval; eeg; restudy; context,False
32,Harnessing shared identities to mobilise resilient responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Shared social identifications (family, community, nation, humanity) predict normative actions and psychological well-being, and can be invoked discursively by leaders to mobilise their followers. We illustrate the potential for harnessing shared identities to mobilise resilient public responses against COVID-19. Study 1, a discursive thematic analysis, contrasted Prime Minister Ardern’s use of identity-based rhetoric to mobilise New Zealanders, with Prime Minister Johnson’s use of individualistic appeals to the UK public. Study 2 explored which patterns of social identification predicted protective behaviours (personal hygiene, physical distancing), prosocial actions (helping proximal and distal others), and psychological wellbeing (mental wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety), among 560 UK adults surveyed during lockdown.

33,"If You’re Funny and You Know It: Personality, Gender, and People’s Ratings of Their Attempts at Humor","In seven studies (n = 1,133), adults tried to create funny ideas and then rated the funniness of their responses, which were also independently rated by judges. People were relatively modest and self-critical about their ideas. Extraversion (r = .12 [.07, .18], k =7) and openness to experience (r = .09 [.03, .15], k = 7) predicted rating one’s responses as funnier; women rated their responses as less funny (d = -.28 [-.37, -.19], k = 7).

34,Socio-cultural values predict COVID-19-related mortality,"Preexisting conditions affect disease susceptibility. Here, I show that socio-cultural values are population-level risk factors for disease. Using data from the World Values Survey, I show that, between 2 weeks and 6 months after the first COVID-19-related death in a country, COVID-19-related mortality is increased in countries endorsing values related to political participation, but decreased in countries with more trust in institutions and materialistic orientations. After controlling for income, age, urbanicity, smoking, overweight, private health expenditure and lockdown delay, these socio-cultural values were consistent across country-sets, reduced prediction errors by up to 52% and explained up to 68% of inter-country variability. They were relatively specific to COVID-19-related mortality. I could not identify values predicting general health outcomes, and values predicting increased COVID-19-related mortality predicted decreased mortality due to other causes like environmental-related mortality, explaining up to 90% of inter-country variability. Socio-cultural values might be specific predictors of health outcomes.",Ansgar D Endress,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-5A6-CFA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-5A6-CFA,2020-12-03,2021-03-10T13:24:08+00:00,bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
35,Transparent Communication About COVID-19 Vaccines Is Not Sufficient for Acceptance but It is Necessary for Trust,"During the rapid development and rolling-out of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, researchers have called for an approach of ""radical transparency"", where vaccine information is transparently disclosed to the public, even if negative information can decrease vaccine uptake. Consistent with theories about the psychology of conspiracy beliefs, these calls predict that a lack of transparency may reduce trust in health authorities and facilitate the spread of conspiracy theories, which may limit the long-term capabilities of health authorities during and after the pandemic. On the basis of pre-registered experiments conducted on large, representative samples of Americans and Danes (N > 13,000), the present study contrasts the effects of vague vaccine communication with transparent communication, which discloses either positive or negative vaccine features. The evidence demonstrates that transparent negative communication may indeed harm vaccine acceptance here and now but that it increases trust in health authorities. Furthermore, the alternative of vague, reassuring communication does not increase vaccine acceptance either and leads to both lower trust and higher endorsements of conspiracy theories.",Michael Bang Petersen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46193-973-263,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46193-973-263,2020-11-28,2021-03-10T08:12:44+00:00,bepress|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; transparency; vaccine; covid-19; conspiracy,False
36,Dynamic patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep during the first month of strict lockdown in two women with major depressive disorder,"This article aimed to document the day-to-day patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep parameters, and to explore the dynamic network structure of depressive symptoms during the first COVID strict lockdown. Two participants with major depressive disorder were included in a 30-days observational ecological momentary assessment study just before the lockdown in Montreal, Canada. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lockdown. However, all depressive symptoms were not systematically exacerbated. Among them, significant linear and non-linear temporal patterns have been identified. For case 1, the lockdown period did not worsen the sleep quality and sleep parameters. The psychomotor retardation, fatigue, appetite loss and level of arousal played a prominent role in the idiographic dynamic symptom networks. These case studies allow a granular understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences dynamics, and highlight the need for person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder.",Paquito Bernard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,2020-07-14,2021-03-09T20:35:36+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; idiographic; sleep; insomnia; covid-19; depressive symptoms,False
37,The seductive allure of technical language and the effect on covid-19 vaccine intentions,"Background: Previous research has demonstrated a ‘seductive allure’ of technical or reductive language. Specifically, bad explanations – i.e., those presenting circular restatements of a phenomenon or other non-explanatory information – are judged better explanations when irrelevant technical language is included. Methods: Using a between subjects design we presented participants (N=996) with one of four possible vignettes that explain how covid-19 vaccinations and herd immunity works. The explanations varied along two factors: (1) Quality, explanations were either good or bad (tautological); (2) Language, explanations either contained unnecessary technical language or did not. We measured participants’ evaluation of the explanations (‘how good’ and ‘how satisfying’ they were) and subsequent intentions to vaccinate. Results: We demonstrate a novel ‘seductive allure’ effect of technical language on vaccine information. Including unnecessary technical language in informative explanations resulted in them being judged worse. However, including irrelevant technical terminology in bad quality explanations resulted in them being judged better. Importantly, we also observe indirect effects of the evaluation of explanations on behavioural intentions to vaccinate. Conclusions: We show that explanatory public health information that omits reductive technical language is more effective in increasing public intentions to vaccinate. We also suggest that misinformation that includes technical language could be more detrimental to vaccination rates.",Jonathan Silas et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-407-8C4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-407-8C4,2021-03-09,2021-03-09T15:55:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; vaccine hesitancy; seductive allure; covid-19; vaccination intentions,False
38,Objectively measured physical activity and symptoms of psychopathology in general population adolescents from the SIGMA cohort,"Background: Less physical activity (PA) has been associated with the development of psychopathology in adolescence. Few studies, however, have focused on understanding the nature of the PA – psychopathology relationship and existing research relies mostly on self-report PA measures, which are less reliable. In this study, we investigated the nature and potential dose-response relationship between objectively measured light physical activity (LPA) and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and psychopathology symptoms in adolescents. Methods: 1130 adolescents (67% female) aged 11-19 years from the SIGMA cohort wore the Fitbit Charge 2 measuring LPA and MVPA during at least three days. Participants completed the Brief Symptom Inventory-53, assessing general symptoms of psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. Model selection was conducted in a subset of the dataset (n = 566) to determine the best fit. The optimal model was then fitted to the remainder of the dataset (n= 564). Results: Results indicated that, compared to non-linear alternatives, a linear relationship between LPA/MVPA and psychopathology fits best. None of these linear associations were significant, however. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that LPA and MVPA are not significantly related to symptoms of general psychopathology, depression, anxiety, and psychoticism. Therefore, this study does not provide evidence that higher durations of LPA and MVPA alone relate to reduced symptoms of psychopathology in the general adolescent population. A more integrative approach considering the interdependency of multiple lifestyle factors, as well as the domain, context, and individual experience of PA may add value to the understanding of the PA- psychopathology relationship.",Noëmi Hagemann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46207-295-EDB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46207-295-EDB,2021-03-04,2021-03-09T14:03:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
39,Imagining Personally-Relevant Outcomes Influences Perceived Risk of Viral Transmission for Older Adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created a serious and prolonged public-health emergency. Older adults have been at significantly greater risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death due to COVID-19; as of February 2021, over 81% of COVID-19-related deaths in the U.S. occurred for people over the age of 65. Converging evidence from around the world suggests that age is the most significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness and for the experience of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, effectively communicating health-related risk information requires tailoring interventions to older adults’ needs. Using a novel informational intervention with a nationally-representative sample of 546 U.S. residents, we found that older adults reported increased perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission after imagining a personalized scenario with social consequences. Although older adults tended to forget numerical information over time, the personalized simulations elicited increases in perceived risk that persisted over a 1-3 week delay. Overall, our results bear broad implications for communicating information about health risks to older adults, and suggest new strategies to combat annual influenza outbreaks.",Alyssa Hannah Sinclair et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46196-0D1-FD4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46196-0D1-FD4,2021-03-08,2021-03-09T09:10:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Aging; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; decision making; socioemotional selectivity; memory; episodic simulation; covid-19; cognition; risk perception; imagination; aging; health,False
40,No Utilitarians in a Pandemic? Shifts in Moral Reasoning during the COVID-19 Global Health Crisis,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses many real-world moral dilemmas, which can pit the needs and rights of the many against the needs and rights of the few. We investigated the influence of this contemporary global crisis on moral judgments in older adults, who are at greatest personal risk from the pandemic. We hypothesized that during this pandemic, individuals would give fewer utilitarian responses to hypothetical dilemmas, accompanied by higher levels of confidence and emotion elicitation. Our pre-registered analysis (https://osf.io/g2wtp) involved two waves of data collection, before (2014) and during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding three categories of moral dilemmas (personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations).

42,"The targets of all treachery: Delusional ideation, paranoia, and the need for uniqueness as mediators between two forms of narcissism and conspiracy beliefs","A number of recent studies have examined whether those high in grandiose narcissism are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. Few studies have, however, considered whether those high in vulnerable narcissism are also apt to believe in conspiracy theories, and none have attempted to identify the mechanisms that link these two forms of narcissism to conspiracy beliefs. The present study (N Participants = 397; N Informants = 460) investigated the relation of both grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism with conspiracist ideation in the context of four theoretically-relevant mediators: (a) delusional ideation, (b) paranoia, (c) the need for uniqueness, and (d) the desire for control. Participants who were higher in grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism were more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, seemingly because they were more likely to hold odd and unusual beliefs. There was, likewise, some evidence to suggest that those high in vulnerable narcissism believe in conspiracy theories because they suffer from paranoia, whereas those high in grandiose narcissism believe in conspiracy theories because of a desire to be unique. Together, these results suggest that the conspiracist ideation seen among those high in grandiose narcissism and vulnerable narcissism is a consequence of features that are shared between and unique to each of the two traits.",Cameron Stuart Kay,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-8C7-261,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-8C7-261,2021-03-05,2021-03-08T16:44:36+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; paranoia; uniqueness; vulnerable narcissism; conspiracy theories; grandiose narcissism; covid-19; delusional ideation; desire for control,False
43,The effect of ego-resiliency and COVID-19-related stress on mental health among the Japanese population,"Due to the negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is necessary to study the factors that improve mental health. In this study, we evaluated changing income, frequency of going out, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and ego-resiliency to investigate the main and moderating effects of ego-resiliency on psychological distress. We analyzed 222 Japanese samples from the dataset of Primary Survey in Japan (PSJ) in the Resilience to COVid-19 in Each Region (RE-COVER) project. The results showed significant main effects of ego-resiliency on depression (ΔR2 = .07, p < .01) and stress (ΔR2 = .02, p < .05), and interaction effect of going out and ego-resiliency on depression (β = .19, p < .01; ΔR2 = .05, p < .01). We also tested the significance of the moderating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between going out and depression. The simple slope of ego-resiliency was only significant for individuals with a low frequency of going out (β = -0.278, t (218) = -4.522, p < .001).

44,A New Remote Guided Method for Supervised Web-Based Cognitive Testing to Ensure High Quality Data,"Background. The global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a fundamental reexamination of how human psychological research can be conducted both safely and robustly in a new era of digital working and physical distancing. Online web-based testing has risen to the fore as a promising solution for rapid mass collection of cognitive data without requiring human contact. However, a long-standing debate exists over the data quality and validity of web-based studies. Here, we examine the opportunities and challenges afforded by the societal shift toward web-based testing, highlight an urgent need to establish a standard data quality assurance framework for online studies, and develop and validate a new supervised online testing methodology, remote guided testing (RGT). Methods. A total of 85 healthy young adults were tested on 10 cognitive tasks assessing executive functioning (flexibility, memory and inhibition) and learning. Tasks were administered either face-to-face in the laboratory (N=41) or online using remote guided testing (N=44), delivered using identical web-based platforms (CANTAB, Inquisit and i-ABC). Data quality was assessed using detailed trial-level measures (missed trials, outlying and excluded responses, response times), as well as overall task performance measures. Results. The results indicated that, across all measures of data quality and performance, RGT data was statistically-equivalent to data collected in person in the lab. Moreover, RGT participants out-performed the lab group on measured verbal intelligence, which could reflect test environment differences, including possible effects of mask-wearing on communication. Conclusions. These data suggest that the RGT methodology could help to ameliorate concerns regarding online data quality and - particularly for studies involving high-risk or rare cohorts - offer an alternative for collecting high-quality human cognitive data without requiring in-person physical attendance.",Victoria Leong et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46140-82C-3D8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46140-82C-3D8,2021-03-07,2021-03-07T19:04:52+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; executive functions; web-based testing; covid; neuropsychological assessment; learning",False
45,Sociodemographic and psychological risk factors for anxiety and depression: Findings from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) cross-sectional survey THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND IS NOW AVAILABLE HERE: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12529-021-09967-z,"ABSTRACT Background: Investigations about mental health report prevalence rates with fewer studies investigating psychological and social factors influencing mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. The aims of the study were to: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression, and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, risk perception, and illness representations. Methods Cross sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. Results 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, 3.8% in the most deprived and 15.6% in the most affluent areas. Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, social isolation, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exaggerated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations, and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. Conclusions These findings confirm the results of previous studies about associations between sociodemographics and adult mental health.

46,Staying home so you can keep going out: A multiplayer self-isolation game modelling pandemic behaviour,"The effectiveness of a nation’s COVID-19 response in limiting transmission depends on people complying with unfamiliar restrictions. The immediate cost of abiding by these restrictions (e.g., by staying home) to the individual is relatively clear, yet other outcomes are delayed and noisy. It is difficult to infer whether others have fallen ill because of one’s own actions, or whether one has played a part in causing a ‘lockdown’. This uncertainty leads people to take cues from their dynamic environment and social norms on the right course of action. This preregistered study investigates how people cooperate, and how the social context influences their decisions using an iterated multiplayer game (akin to a public goods game), wherein they encounter various levels of compliance of others, variations in disease prevalence, and differences in the costliness of a lockdown. Participants indicate how much they would hypothetically isolate themselves for each level of average self-isolation by others in the group, they predict how much others will self-isolate, and make a decision about their own self-isolation. We show that participants tend to self-isolate more when they predict others will self-isolate more, and when there are more infected players in the group; we show that participants suffer from illusory superiority, underestimating others’ self-isolation compared to their own, and we show that higher perceived cost of lockdown leads to more compliance, but that this effect is stronger when players predict that others will be compliant too.",Simon Thomas Van Baal et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-0D9-2DB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-0D9-2DB,2021-02-26,2021-03-07T05:23:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; self-isolation; social norms; illusory superiority; pandemic; public goods; covid-19; compliance; economic game,False
47,What to target when reopening universities in times of COVID-19? Selecting relevant and changeable determinants and underlying beliefs of university students’ adherence to COVID-19-guidelines,"Objective: When reopening universities in times of COVID-19, students still have to adhere to COVID-19 behavioral guidelines. We explored what behavioral determinants (and underlying beliefs) related to the adherence to guidelines are both relevant and changeable, as input for future interventions. Design: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted (Oct-Nov 2020), identifying behavioral determinants (and underlying beliefs) of university students’ adherence to COVID-19-guidelines, including keeping 1.5m distance, getting tested, and isolating (N = 255). Main Outcomes: Determinants and underlying beliefs of students’ adherence to COVID-19-guidelines. Results: Attitude, perceived norm, self-efficacy, and several beliefs (e.g., risk perception beliefs ‘I am not afraid because I am young’; attitudinal beliefs, e.g., ‘I feel responsible for telling people to adhere to guidelines’; self-efficacy beliefs, e.g., ‘COVID-19-prevention guidelines are difficult to adhere to’) were strongly associated with intention to adhere to guidelines, and for those beliefs there was room for improvement, making them suitable as possible intervention targets. Conclusion: Students mostly adhere to COVID-19 guidelines, but there is room for improvement. Interventions need to enhance students’ adherence behavior by targeting the most relevant determinants as identified in this study. Based on these findings, a small intervention was introduced targeting the determinants of students’ adherence to guidelines.",Tugce Varol et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-EA1-207,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-EA1-207,2021-03-05,2021-03-06T18:04:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; university students; adherence; covid-19; determinants; intervention; guidelines,False
48,The Behavioral Immune System and Vaccination Intentions During the Coronavirus Pandemic,"The behavioral immune system is considered to be a psychological adaptation that decreases the risk of infection. Research suggests that, in the current environment, this system can produce attitudes with negative health consequences, such as increased vaccine hesitancy. In three studies, we investigated whether two facets of the behavioral immune system—contamination aversion (i.e., avoiding potential contamination) and perceived infectability (i.e., perceived susceptibility to disease)—predicted intentions to accept COVID-19, influenza, and measles or general childhood vaccinations. Both contamination aversion and perceived infectability were higher during than before the pandemic. In contrast to previous research, those with higher contamination aversion during the pandemic perceived vaccines to be safer and had higher intentions to accept vaccination. Contamination aversion before the pandemic was not associated with perceived vaccine safety or vaccination intentions during the pandemic. Individuals who perceived themselves as more susceptible to diseases were slightly more willing to accept vaccination.

50,COVID-19 first lockdown as a unique window into language acquisition: What you do (with your child) matters.,"The COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting closure of daycare centers worldwide, led to unprecedented changes in children’s learning environments. This period of increased time at home with caregivers, with limited access to external sources (e.g., daycares) provides a unique opportunity to examine the associations between the caregiver-child activities and children’s language development. The vocabularies of 1742 children aged 8-36 months across 13 countries and 12 languages were evaluated at the beginning and end of the first lockdown period in their respective countries (from March to September 2020). Children who had less passive screen exposure and whose caregivers read more to them showed larger gains in vocabulary development during lockdown, after controlling for SES and other caregiver-child activities. Children also gained more words than expected (based on normative data) during lockdown; either caregivers were more aware of their child’s development or vocabulary development benefited from intense caregiver-child interaction during lockdown.",Natalia Kartushina et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46082-B00-1CE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46082-B00-1CE,2021-03-05,2021-03-05T19:05:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Language Aquisition; book reading; vocabulary development; longitudinal study; passive screen exposure; covid-19 pandemic; multi-country; pre-registered,False
51,Social behavior and youth psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented changes to the lives of youth, including social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders resulting in a sudden and stark reduction in daily social interactions for children and adolescents. Given that peer relationships are especially important during this developmental stage, it is crucial to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on social behavior and risk for mental health problems in children and adolescents. Method: In a longitudinal sample (N=224, aged 7-15 years old) assessed at three strategic time points (prior to the pandemic, during the stay-at-home order period, and again six months later), we examine the social lives of children and adolescents and whether certain social behaviors may protect against increases in internalizing and externalizing problems during the pandemic. Results: Youth who reported lower levels of in-person and digital socialization, greater social isolation, and less peer and parent support had heightened internalizing and externalizing symptoms during the pandemic, controlling for pre-pandemic symptoms. Youth who reported more social connectedness and increased use of digital socialization during the pandemic were less likely to develop psychopathology after experiencing pandemic-related stressors. In addition, children, but not adolescents, who maintained some socialization in-person were less likely to develop internalizing symptoms following exposure to pandemic-related stressors. Conclusion: Using a longitudinal design, we identify social factors that promote well-being and resilience in children and adolescents during this societal event. We provide practical recommendations to mitigate risk of psychopathology resulting from the dramatic changes in youths’ social experiences during the pandemic.",Alexandra M Rodman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46249-00F-2C4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46249-00F-2C4,2021-03-04,2021-03-05T15:38:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development,False
52,Stage 1 RR - Application of sentence-level text analysis: The role of emotion in an experimental learning intervention,"This secondary-analysis registered report aims at testing the role of emotion in the intervention effect of an experimental intervention study in academic settings. Previous analyses of the National Study of the Learning Mindset (Yeager et al., 2019) showed that in a randomized controlled trial, high school students who were given the growth mindset intervention had, on average higher GPA than did students in the control condition. Previous analyses also showed that school achievement levels moderated the intervention effect. This study applies a sentence-level text analysis strategy to detect participants’ attentional focus in five emotional dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance/control, approach-avoidant, and uncertainty) across three writing prompts students wrote during the intervention. Linear mixed models are conducted to test if emotional dimension scores computed using the text analysis predicted a higher intervention effect (i.e. higher post-intervention GPA given pre-intervention GPA). The moderating role of school achievement levels was also examined. A 10% random sample of the data was analyzed as a pilot study for this registered report to test for feasibility. The results of this study have implications on the possibility of applying text analysis strategies on brief open-ended questions in interventions or experimental studies to examine the role of the emotion-attentional focus of participants during intervention or experimental studies on the intervention or experimental outcomes, especially those that are conducted in academic settings.",Manyu Li,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-5F2-5C7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-5F2-5C7,2020-08-01,2021-03-03T21:59:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation,False
53,"A large-scale study of changes to the quantity, quality, and distribution of video game play during the COVID-19 pandemic","Video game play has been framed both as protective factor and risk to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an objective analysis of changes to video game play during the pandemic to provide an empirical foundation to the fractured discourse surrounding play and mental health. Analyses of millions of players’ engagement with the 500 globally most popular games on the Steam platform indicated that the quantity of play had dramatically increased during key points of the pandemic; that those increases were more prominent for multiplayer games, suggesting that gamers were seeking out the social affordances of video game play; and that play had become more equally distributed across days of the week, suggesting increased merging of leisure activities with work and school activities.

54,The Impact of Information Sources on Covid-19 Knowledge Accumulation and Vaccination Intention,"During a global health crisis, people are exposed to vast amounts of information from a variety of sources. Here, we assessed which information sources could increase knowledge about COVID-19 (Study 1) and the COVID-19 vaccines (Study 2). In Study 1, a US census matched sample of 1060 Cloud Research participants rated the accuracy of a set of statements and then were randomly assigned to one of 10 between-subjects conditions of varying sources providing belief-relevant information: a political leader (Trump/Biden), a health authority (Fauci/CDC), an anecdote (Democrat/Republican), a large group of prior participants (Democrats/Republicans/Generic), or no source (Control). Finally, they rated the accuracy of the initial set of statements again. Study 2 involved a replication with a sample of 1876 Cloud Research participants, and focused on COVID-19 vaccine information and vaccination intention. In both studies, we found that participants acquired most knowledge when the source of information was a generic group of people. Surprisingly, knowledge accumulation from the different information sources did not interact with participants’ political affiliation. However, information accumulation interacted with political affiliation in predicting vaccination intention.",Madalina Vlasceanu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617F-0FB-FFC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617F-0FB-FFC,2020-08-15,2021-03-03T14:00:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology,False
55,The pandemic fallacy: Inaccuracy of social scientists’ and lay judgments about COVID-19’s societal consequences in America,"Effective management of global crises relies on expert judgment of their societal effects. How accurate are such judgments? In the spring of 2020, we asked social scientists (N = 717) and lay Americans (N = 394) to make predictions about COVID-19 pandemic-related societal change across social and psychological domains. Six months later we obtained retrospective assessments for the same domains (Nscientists = 270; NlayP = 411) and compared these judgments to objective data to assess estimation accuracy. Social scientists were no more accurate than lay people, neither in prospective nor retrospective judgments. Across studies and samples, estimates of the magnitude of change were off by more than 20% and less than half of participants accurately predicted the direction of changes. Taken together, we find that experts and lay people fared poorly at predicting social and psychological consequences of the pandemic and misperceive what effects it may have already had.",Cendri Hutcherson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603F-36A-8A2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603F-36A-8A2,2021-02-11,2021-03-02T19:24:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; climate change beliefs; overconfidence; prosocial behavior; cultural change; fertility; covid-19; religiosity; political polarization; lay theories; prejudice; loneliness; generalized trust; prediction; expert judgment; violence; scientific intuitions; individualism; depression; life satisfaction; forecasting; traditionalism,False
56,The development and validation of the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale: Psychometric evaluation among mainland Chinese university students,"Background: COVID-19 continues to ravage the world with economies and life significantly and negatively affected. Fortunately, there has been significant progress in the production of vaccines to stem the infection. However, with controversies and myths surrounding vaccinations, it is timely to examine individuals’ willingness to vaccinate. The present study developed and validated the Motors of COVID-19 Vaccination Acceptance Scale (MoVac-COVID19S) and assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination utilizing the cognitive model of empowerment (CME). Methods: A total of 3145 university students (mean age=20.80 years; SD=2.09) were recruited for the present study between January 5 and 16, 2021. Two MoVac-COVID19S scales (9-item and 12-item) were adapted from the MoVac-Flu Scale, an instrument developed using CME. Psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain reliability and validity properties. Results: The findings indicated that the MoVac-COVID19S had high internal consistency in both the 9-item version (ω=0.921) and 12-item version (ω=0.898). The factor structure of the MoVac-COVID19S (9-item and 12-item versions) corresponded well with CME theory. All the fit indices were satisfactory (CFI=0.984, TLI=0.971, RMSEA=0.088, SRMR=0.058) but the 9-item MoVac-COVID had better fit indices than the 12-item MoVac-COVID due to the negative wording effects existing in the 12-item MoVac-COVID19S. The scale had satisfactory known-group validity in both 9-item and 12-item versions. Conclusions: The MoVac-COVID19S has promising psychometric properties based on internal consistency, factor structure, and known-group validity.",I-Hua Chen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-6FD-4B4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-6FD-4B4,2021-03-02,2021-03-02T18:05:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
57,"ADHD symptoms predict lower adaptation to the COVID-19 outbreak: financial decline, low adherence to preventive measures, psychological distress, and illness-related negative perceptions","Objective. The COVID-19 outbreak created numerous multidimensional stressors, to which people show different levels of vulnerability. The current paper examines whether ADHD symptoms are associated with poorer adaptation. Method. 2055 adults participated in an online survey after the first quarantine in Israel. Participants completed scales probing adaptation indicators: financial status, adherence to preventive measures, mental health, and COVID-19 related perceptions. Background measures, including the level of ADHD symptoms, were collected. Results. Adaptation indicators negatively correlated with the level of ADHD symptoms. Financial decline explained a small portion of the link between ADHD and decreased mental health; background risk-taking, anti-social, and pro-social behavior partially explained the link between ADHD and non-adherence to preventive measures; COVID-19 related perceptions also partially explained the same link. Conclusion. The current study suggests that people with ADHD are more vulnerable to the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore deserve special attention and care.",Yehuda Pollak et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-1B5-17A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-1B5-17A,2021-03-02,2021-03-02T18:01:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health,False
58,Was the COVID-19 pandemic associated with a change in the pace of self-inflicted injury deaths?: A time series analysis of suicide and accidental injury mortality data,"The COVID-19 pandemic struck in the context of growing self-inflicted injury rates and appears to have increased nation-wide levels of distress. This study describes mortality trends in Maryland during the first six months of the pandemic and adds to the current literature by accounting for characteristics of pre-pandemic mortality trends and by distinguishing differences in mortality trends based on cause (e.g., overdose) and manner (e.g., suicidal) of death. We obtained data for all unnatural deaths in Maryland from January 2003 to August 2020 from the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. We grouped decedents based on cause and manner of death (e.g., suicidal poisoning). We used ARIMA, exponential smoothing, and/or seasonal time series modeling to project the expected rate of self-inflicted mortality during March through August 2020. We compared expected mortality rates based on these self-inflicted injury models to the observed during the pandemic period mortality to investigate the hypothesis that self-inflicted injury deaths would increase at a more rapid pace than observed prior to the pandemic. The models forecasting accidental overdose deaths fit the data well (model R2 = .90, model BIC = 3.77). There were more deaths by accidental poisoning and fewer deaths by accidental falls in March and May 2020 than predicted by pre-COVID-19 models. Most self-inflicted suicidal and accidental injury deaths appear to continue to occur at the same rate during the early months of the pandemic. This research is limited by its use a limited dataset that captured mortality in one state for six months. This study may not capture longer-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or the association between the pandemic and rarer events (e.g., firearm deaths.) Additionally, this study does not account for the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color who are dying by suicide at a faster rate than their White counterparts in Maryland during the pandemic.",Alison Athey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622C-A57-2FF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622C-A57-2FF,2021-03-01,2021-03-01T23:34:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; premature mortality; suicide; covid-19; arima; pandemic; time series model; overdose; accident,False
59,Direct and indirect effects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and emotion regulation strategy use on mental health during Covid-19,"Background. Covid-19 and associated restrictions have been linked to negative mental health outcomes across the globe. Cognitive emotion regulation strategies constitute means to mitigating negative affect and are associated with prefrontal and limbic brain regions. Methods. Variations in cognitive emotion regulation strategy use, anxiety and depression in 43 adults (31♀, average age=35.14±9.20y) and emotional and behavioral problems in 26 children (10♀, average age=10.69±2.52y) were tested seven times following Covid-19 onset (March-December 2020). Relationships between pre-pandemic brain structure, use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies and mental well-being were tested using multiple regression and mediation models. Results. Covid-19 and associated restrictions were linked to heightened, but varying levels of anxiety and depression across 2020. While adaptive strategies were most employed, maladaptive strategies explained the highest variation in negative mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depression). Adaptive strategies had a positive, maladaptive strategies a negative effect, however, this direction varied for some strategies when considering long-term effects. Emotion regulation strategy use mediated the association between pre-pandemic brain structure (i.e., cortical thickness) in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and well-being, with prefrontal-amygdala coupling as a possible driving factor. Additionally, early well-being measures were crucial for later well-being. Conclusion. Our findings support the use of early intervention strategies for mental health consequences due to the pandemic. Due to substantial personal and societal costs associated with mental health disorders, such as anxiety and depression, an early identification of risk factors for the development and treatment response are of utmost importance.",Plamina Dimanova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-484-515,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-484-515,2021-03-01,2021-03-01T22:50:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; prefrontal cortex; covid-19; emotion regulation; neuroimaging,False
60,Contributions of emotion regulation and brain structure and function to adolescent internalizing problems and stress vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study,"Background: Adolescence is a period of increased vulnerability for internalizing problems, particularly following exposure to stressful life events. We examine how patterns of emotion regulation and brain structure and function predict internalizing problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as moderate the association between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems. Methods: Data are from a longitudinal sample (N=145, aged 10-15) strategically assessed at three crucial timepoints: prior to the pandemic, early during the stay-at-home order period, and again six months later. We examined associations of neural structure and function during an emotional processing task prior to the pandemic, use of emotion regulation strategies prior to and during the pandemic, and pandemic-related stressors with internalizing problems. Results: Greater exposure to pandemic-related stressors was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms both early (ß=.437, p<.001) and later (ß=.225, p=.004) in the pandemic. Youth who reported more frequent use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies, including rumination (ß=.204, p=.026) and expressive suppression (ß=.177, p=.023), also had higher internalizing problems. Higher left amygdala activation to neutral relative to fearful faces prior to the pandemic was associated with greater internalizing symptoms (ß=-.229, p=.007), and a stronger relation between pandemic-related stressors and internalizing problems (ß=-.186, p=.014). Conclusion: Pandemic-related stressors are strongly associated with internalizing problems in adolescents, and individual differences in emotional reactivity and regulation and their underlying neural mechanisms contribute to stress-related vulnerability. Interventions that reduce pandemic-related stressors and foster adaptive emotion regulation skills may protect against adolescent psychopathology during this period of heightened exposure to stress.",David G Weissman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46063-AFF-51C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46063-AFF-51C,2021-03-01,2021-03-01T22:48:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; expressive suppression; psychopathology; hippocampus; amygdala; cognitive reappraisal,False
61,Changes in the Era of COVID-19: What Can We Learn from the Acceleration of Opioid Overdose Deaths in Maryland over 15 years,"This study tracks the number of accidental opioid overdose deaths (OOD) in Maryland from 2003-2020 and evaluates longitudinal trends, with a focus on increased mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. All Marylanders with positive toxicology findings for opioids at the time of death from January 2003 through August 2020 (n = 1276) were included in analyses. Data were provided by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) which evaluates all unexpected deaths in the state. We explored longitudinal trends in the data and found a simple seasonal pattern. The number of OOD during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to the number of predicted by pre-pandemic data period. We compared opioid overdose decedents from spring 2019 with those who died in the spring of 2020 to assess the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with changes in manner of death and risk factors for opioid overdose. The likelihood of an overdose death being ruled intentional was lower during the pandemic, and there was a shift in patterns of substance use which may have reflected disrupted access to preferred substances of abuse and medication assisted treatment during the lockdown. More research that includes nationally representative data, extends beyond the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and addresses mechanisms that drive change in substance use and treatment in the context of multiple national emergencies is needed.v",Alison Athey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46097-8C3-051,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46097-8C3-051,2021-03-01,2021-03-01T22:47:37+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; opioid; covid-19; overdose; postmortem,False

International college students are at increased risk of developing mental disorders, which calls for effective preventive interventions. Previous work found modest effectiveness of physical activity (PA) in preventing and treating depression, whereas whether the intervention is effective among healthy individuals remains unclear. This study aims to design a low-intensify physical training to improve international students’ mood status. We used a 22-day multiple baseline design (MBD) with three healthy international students. The visual and randomization test were analyses using the R packages (RcmdrPlugin.SCDA and dependent packages). Results showed that taking mild aerobic exercise helps participants experience more positive moods (happy, energetic, concentrated), whereas PA had no significant effects on reducing negative moods (tired, anxious, depressed, sleepy).

We describe the key variables that we suggest will affect public behaviour relevant to the spread of the virus, drawing upon four sources: (1) relevant evidence and recommendations from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours produced for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE); (2) research evidence from non-pandemic conditions; (3) research on behaviour during the pandemic; and (4) relevant theory. We first outline some basic risks and a framework for understanding collective behaviour at live events. We then survey some trends in UK public behaviour observed over 2020 and how these might interact with the opening of live events and venues. We present a range of mitigation strategies, based on the framework for collective behaviour and on what is known about non-pharmaceutical (i.e. behavioural) interventions in relation to Covid-19.",John Drury et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-697-291,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-697-291,2021-02-27,2021-03-01T19:06:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; guidance; live events; covid-19; music; sport,False
64,Time-dependent association between the discussions of mass protests and mental health on social media during the 2019 anti-government social unrest in Hong Kong: A text mining study,"Purpose Social media are increasingly pivotal as the platform where activists and observers plan, promote, and respond to collective actions. To examine how mental health discourse might be impacted by mass protests, this study analyzed their time-dependent association during the 2019 anti-government social unrest in Hong Kong. Methods Consecutive day-by-day user-generated content on online forums and social network sites (SNS) from June to November 2019 was obtained. A Cantonese term-list was created to identify terms related to mass protests and mental health discourse. The frequency of comments containing such terms was analyzed using time series models. Results There were 3,572,665 social media comments in the investigation period. As hypothesized, the frequency of comments with mass protest terms was higher on days with mass protests than on days without. Frequency of comments with both mass protest- and mental health-terms was also higher on days with protests than days without. A time-lagged effect of protest-terms was found on online forums but not on SNS. Our results suggest a positive association between offline protest activities and online psychological reactions. Conclusions Social media content reveals discussion of mental health concerns stemming from, or exacerbated by, social unrest. The potential mutual influences between mass protests and online reactions, as well as the functional differences between online forums and SNS in this regard, are discussed. Street protests and their associated mental health discourse can be readily detected on popular online forums.

65,Trajectories of change in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal population-based study,"Background: Longitudinal data indicates that the mental health of the general population may not have been as badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as some had feared. Most studies examining change in mental health during the pandemic have assumed population homogeneity which may conceal evidence of worsening mental health for some. In this study, we applied a heterogeneous perspective to determine if there were distinct groups in the population characterised by different patterns of change in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic. Methods: Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative sample of Irish adults (N = 1,041) at four time-points between April and December 2020. Results: In the entire sample, mean levels of internalizing symptoms significantly declined from March to December 2020. However, we identified four distinct groups with different patterns of change. The most common response was ‘Resilience’ (66.7%), followed by ‘Improving’ (17.9%), ‘Worsening’ (11.3%), and ‘Sustained’ (4.1%). Belonging to the ‘Worsening’ class was associated with younger age, city dwelling, current and past treatment for a mental health problem, higher levels of empathy, and higher levels of loneliness. Limitations: Sample attrition was relatively high and although this was managed using robust statistical methods, bias associated with non-responses cannot be entirely ruled out.

66,Resistance to COVID-19 vaccination has increased in Ireland and the UK during the pandemic,"Objectives: Hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination poses a serious challenge to achieving adequate vaccine uptake in the general population. Cross-sectional data from the early months of the pandemic indicates that approximately one-third of adults in multiple nations are hesitant or resistant to a vaccine for COVID-19. Using longitudinal data, we tracked changes in attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination during the pandemic. Study Design: A quantitative, longitudinal design. Method: Nationally representative samples of the adult general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) and the United Kingdom (N = 2,025) were assessed for their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination at three points from March to August 2020. Results: Statistically significant increases in resistance to COVID-19 vaccination were observed in Irish (from 9.5% to 18.1%) and British (6.2% to 10%) adults. Conclusion: Resistance to vaccination has significantly increased in two European nations as the pandemic has progressed.

67,"Mixed Emotions, But Not Positive or Negative Emotions, Facilitate Legitimate Virus-Prevention Behaviors and Eudaimonic Outcomes in the Emergence of the COVID-19 Crisis","We report four studies (N=1419) examining emotional reactions from March to April 2020, when COVID-19 exhibited exponentially increasing infections and fatalities. Specifically, we examined associations between emotions with self-reported intentions to enact virus-prevention behaviors that protect oneself from COVID-19 and eudaimonic functioning. Study 1A, 1B, and Study 2 provided naturalistic evidence that mixed emotions predicted legitimate virus-prevention behaviors and eudaimonic functioning in the United States and Singapore, and Study 2 also supported receptivity as a mediator. Finally, Study 3 provided experimental evidence that mixed emotions causally increased legitimate virus-prevention behaviors relative to neutral, positive emotion, and negative emotion conditions, whereas eudaimonic functioning was increased only relative to the neutral condition. Across all studies, positive and negative emotions were unrelated to legitimate virus-prevention behaviors, while relationships with eudaimonic functioning were inconsistent. While self-reported measures do not represent actual behaviors, the findings suggest a potential role for mixed emotions in pandemic-related outcomes.",Oh Yong Sheng Vincent et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-692-053,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-692-053,2020-10-13,2021-03-01T08:55:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; emotions; virus-prevention behaviors; well-being; mixed emotions; covid-19; affect,False
68,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health: A Longitudinal Examination of Risk and Protective Factors,"The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to unprecedented changes in daily living. College students may face unique challenges associated with these changes. In the present study, college students (N = 205) completed a battery of questionnaires in April of 2020, after having completed similar measures 8, 5, and 2 months prior as part of a larger study. A repeated measures ANOVA suggested significantly greater depression and anxiety symptom severity during the pandemic than at any other time during the 2019-2020 academic year. Static and modifiable factors associated with psychological distress and controlling for pre-existing psychological distress were examined. Cognitive and behavioral avoidance was the most consistent predictor of psychological distress during the pandemic. Online social engagement and problematic Internet use also conferred greater risk.

69,"To Sit Quietly in a Room Alone: The Psychology of Social, Material, and Sensation Seeking Input","External input is any kind of physical stimulation created by an individual’s surroundings that can be detected by the senses. The present research established a novel conceptualization of this construct by investigating it from the perspective of three research areas that tap into its different aspects but have so far been disconnected—materialism, social motives, and sensation seeking. Studies 1-5 focused on individual differences regarding external input (i.e., the needs for material, social, and sensation seeking input). It was established that the three needs are positively related and constitute different dimensions of the overarching construct of external input, that the needs for social and sensation seeking input have negative consequences for how people experience long-term input deprivation (i.e., COVID-19 restrictions), and that the need for material input has negative consequences for people’s experiences of short-term input deprivation (i.e., sitting in a chair without doing anything else but thinking). Finally, Study 6 focused on external input as a situational characteristic and showed that the degree of sensation seeking input constituting various situations is a more important predictor, relative to social and material input, of how enjoyable and meaningful people perceive the situations and of their willingness to engage in them. Overall, the present research established a novel construct that has fundamental implications for people’s experiences and actions in a range of different contexts.",Dario Krpan,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-C11-AD0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-C11-AD0,2021-02-24,2021-02-28T13:12:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; materialism; input; self-sufficiency; social; stimulation,False
70,PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS OCCURRING AFTER THE FIRST WAVE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN POLAND,"The article presents the results of research aimed to identify the predictors of psychological distress among Poles seven months after the occurrence of the first case of COVID-19. In order to gather the research material, the CAWI on-line survey method was applied and carried out within the framework of the Ariadna Research Panel on the sample of 1079 Poles aged 15 and over. The results of the conducted research indicate that Polish society experienced psychological distress as a result of the first wave of the pandemic. According to the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), no mental disorders were observed among 36% of Poles, mild mental disorders were observed among 23% of respondents, average levels of disorders were observed among 18% of respondents, whereas high levels of disorders were observed among 23% of respondents. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of psychological distress. In the first stage, socio-demographic variables explained 20% of the distress variance. In the second stage, the variables measuring social nuisances of the pandemic were introduced, which increased the percentage of the explained stress variance to 33%. In the third stage, the introduced psychological variables increased the percentage of the explained variance to 73%. The main factor which increased stress levels was neuroticism. The conducted analyses have shown that the lack of social, economic and psychological capital significantly increases the susceptibility to distress when a threat to life and health lasts for a prolonged period of time.",Piotr Długosz,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46146-BB9-70C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46146-BB9-70C,2021-02-24,2021-02-28T13:07:37+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19 pandemic; poland; predictors of stress; psychological distress; neuroticism",False
71,"Refuting the myth of a ‘tsunami’ of mental ill-health in populations affected by COVID-19: Evidence that response to the pandemic is heterogenous, not homogeneous","Background: The current study argues that population prevalence estimates for mental health disorders, or changes in mean scores over time, may not adequately reflect the heterogeneity in mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic within the population. Methods: The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N=2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N=1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N=1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19 related PTSD with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. Results: Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement, and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. Conclusions: A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress (‘resilient’ class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.",Mark Shevlin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-896-FBA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-896-FBA,2021-02-23,2021-02-28T12:57:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; longitudinal; latent class growth analysis; covid-19; general popualtion; posttraumatic stress; mental health; depression; anxiety,False
72,Perspectives of early childhood teachers in Ireland on the role of play during the pandemic,"School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted the education of 91% of students worldwide. As a critical process in supporting young children’s resilience, play is increasingly recognised as a valuable pedagogical strategy within a shifting educational landscape during the pandemic. This study reports on findings from a survey on play in early childhood education of 309 early childhood teachers during primary school closures in Ireland. Eighty-two per cent of teachers recommended play strategies to parents during remote teaching and home schooling and almost all teachers (99%) intended to use play as a pedagogical strategy upon school reopening. Teachers believed play was an especially important pedagogical tool in supporting young children’s social-emotional development, learning and transition back to school. Over a third highlighted uncertainty surrounding capacity to use play upon school reopening given COVID-19 regulations, emphasizing the need for greater guidance to support teachers’ commitment to play-based pedagogical strategies.",Christina O'Keeffe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46083-11C-347,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46083-11C-347,2020-08-06,2021-02-28T12:28:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; resilience; covid-19; teachers' perspectives; play; pandemic; early childhood education,False
73,Adolescents’ Social Media Experiences and Their Self-Esteem: A Person-Specific Susceptibility Perspective,"The aim of this preregistered study was to compare and explain the effects of (a) time spent on social media (SM), and (b) the valence (positivity or negativity) of SM experiences on adolescents’ self-esteem. We conducted a three-week experience sampling study among 300 adolescents (13-16 years; 126 assessments per adolescent; 21,970 assessments in total). Using a novel N=1 method of analysis (Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling), we found that the within-person effects of time spent with SM on self-esteem ranged from strongly negative ( = –.31) to moderately positive ( = +.27). Across all ESM observations of the valence of adolescents’ SM experiences, 55% of these experiences were positive, 18% negative, and 27% neutral. Finally, 78% of adolescents experienced a positive within-person effect of the valence of SM experiences on self-esteem ( ≥ +.05), 19% no to very small effects (–.05 <  < +.05), and 3% a negative effect ( ≤ –.05). These sizeable differences in person-specific effects could be explained by adolescents’ trait self-esteem level, trait self-esteem instability, and their tendency to base their self-esteem on peer approval.",Patti M.

74,"Pandemic Fatigue: Measurement, Correlates, and Consequences","With no effective treatment or vaccine widely available, most national COVID-19 response strategies have relied on people’s willingness to comply with health-protective behaviours and behavioural restrictions. Despite generally high levels of public compliance, several countries have reported a recent upsurge in the number of people who no longer sufficiently adhere to restrictions or keep themselves informed about COVID-19. This developing trend has been attributed to Pandemic Fatigue. Using quota-representative survey data from Denmark and Germany (overall n = 12,191), we introduce a psychometrically sound measure of Pandemic Fatigue, show who experiences it, identify related emotions and perceptions, and shed light on the relation between Pandemic Fatigue and four COVID-19-related health-protective behaviours. Further, based on a preregistered online experiment with US participants (n = 1,584), we establish a causal link between Pandemic Fatigue and people’s intention to comply with recommended heath-protective behaviours.",Lau Lilleholt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-D9F-581,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-D9F-581,2020-12-17,2021-02-27T10:57:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
75,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.",Michelle N.

77,"Self-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, affective responding, and subjective well-being - A Swedish survey","A rapid stream of research confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat to mental health and psychological well-being. It is therefore important to identify both hazardous and protective individual factors during the pandemic. The current research examined the relationships between self-reported affective responding, perceived personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subjective well-being. An online survey (N = 471) conducted in Sweden between June and September, 2020, showed that higher levels of irritability, impulsivity, and the tendency to experience and express anger were generally associated with more severe personal consequences of the pandemic, particularly in areas related to family life, work/study, and finances. While more severe impacts of the pandemic in these areas of life were directly associated with lower subjective well-being, emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal appeared to moderate the extent to which consequences of the pandemic in other areas of life (i.e., social, free-time and physical activities) translated into decreased well-being. This suggests that cognitive reappraisal may serve to protect against some of the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.

78,Children’s psychological well-being and problem behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online study during the lockdown period in Germany,"As COVID-19 dramatically changes human social life, restrictive lockdown periods to slow the spread of the virus have been suggest to particularly affect the psychological well-being of children and their families. To capture lockdown-related effects on a large scale, the present study used an online questionnaire completed by parents of 3-10-year-olds during the most restrictive lockdown period in Germany thus far (N = 2,672). Parents reported their stress level, their child’s well-being, and their child’s problem behaviors among others. Results showed that most parents and children experienced lockdown-related stress. Concerning children, not being able to meet with friends and family members outside the household emerged as the primary challenge. Older children (7-10 years) evidenced more emotional symptoms as well as less conduct problems and hyperactivity than younger children (3-6 years). Children’s own and their parents’ stress level, the degree to which children missed other children, and children’s age all showed to be negatively related to children’s general life satisfaction. Single parenthood and being an only child emerged as potential risk factors for children’s well-being. Taken together, these findings shed light on the psychological situation of children and their families during governmental lockdown measures, as well as on relations of children’s coping and demographic background. They have implications for possible avenues for interventions, inter alia by encouraging policies focusing on children from single parent families, on only children as well as on families in difficult housing situations.",Natalie Christner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46170-F0D-566,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46170-F0D-566,2021-02-25,2021-02-26T19:16:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; child well-being; child problem behavior; parental strain; lockdown; covid-19,False

However, to date, service user involvement within child and adolescent mental health research is still uncommon and there is limited focus on best practice within the literature. Furthermore, consultations and advisory groups have traditionally been held face-to-face; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a shift towards online research involvement as an alternative. This paper will examine our experience of conducting online expert advisory groups with young people (aged 14-24) with lived experience of depression and describe challenges and adaptations that need to be considered in order to make the events safe and accessible. Based on our own reflections of the process and feedback from young people taking part, we highlight the grouping of young people, facilitating pre-session nerves, intergroup communication and accessibility of online engagement.

The aim of the study was to investigate temporal dynamics of psychological impact in a longer period covering phases of the epidemic growth, culmination, decrease, and slow return to a normal lifestyle. The sample of 2716 respondents aged between 18 and 89 years participated in an online survey from March 18th to May 25th, 2020; part of them (typically seniors and others, who had not access to the internet) were assisted in entering the data by trained interviewers. The survey comprised questionnaires capturing emotional states, psychological disturbance, anxiety, and depression. The changes in the scores by time phase were studied for the whole sample and for gender and age groups. The results show that the threat of COVID-19 caused a significant increase in negative emotional experience and in the symptoms of psychological disturbance, anxiety, and depression in the Czech population in time of infection culmination, even when the spread of the pandemic was well controlled, and then a gradual decline over time. The data indicated that the pandemic situation had a more pronounced impact on women and younger adults.

How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals are specifically impacted amid this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate correlates of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (“slums”) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: A total of 435 individuals (male=54.7%; mean age=45.0±12.0 years; age range=18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Associated factors included female gender, primary education, jobless, food scarcity, and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, being jobless, being divorced, living in a joint family, excessive sleep, and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness, and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. Limitations: Potential limitations included cross-sectional study design and limited sample size. Conclusions: Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services, should be introduced to mitigate against psychological and financial effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.",Saiful Islam et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5,2020-11-08,2021-02-25T14:16:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,False

We focus here on how the relationship one has with those they play video games with relates to social well-being. We further applied the self-determination theory to determine what role, if any, autonomy, competence, and relatedness play in this relationship. Results indicate that playing with ‘known others’ predicts the highest levels of social well-being when compared to playing with online acquaintances. Further, autonomy, competence, and relatedness all predict high levels of social well-being and mediate the relation between a player’s relationship to other players and social well-being.

84,"Spatial maps of emotions reveal links between environment, mental health, and interoception","People reason, feel, and interact in extensive environments. As they explore their surroundings, their space becomes intertwined with emotional experiences. Yet, beyond navigational behaviours, little is known about the distribution of emotions and cognition in topographical space. Here we developed a novel method that, even in the absence of mobility (i.e., during the national Covid-19 lockdown), allowed us to sample the link between emotions, environment, mental health, and the capability to sense/interpret inner bodily sensations (interoception). We gave participants maps of the region on which they lived and asked them to indicate, by applying shade to the map, the areas where they had happy and sad memories, and where they wanted to go after the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. We also asked them to complete two self-report questionnaires on mental health and interoceptive awareness. By adapting neuroimaging methods, we examined shaded pixels instead of voxels in the brain to quantify where in the maps and how strong different emotions relate to one’s geographical space. The results revealed that positive emotions, mental health, and internal bodily regulation were associated with discrete, yet partially overlapping spatial locations. Importantly, participants’ mapping response and where they wanted to go after the lockdown overlapped significantly with natural environments (vs. non-natural). Considering that environments feature relevant resources for the attainment of psychophysiological balance, our results provide new evidence that supports contemporary models of allostasis in topographical space. Revealing spatial maps of emotions and linking these to individuals’ differences provides a novel spatially contextualised biomarker for physical and mental disorders.",Alejandro Galvez-Pol et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-8D6-7B7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-8D6-7B7,2021-02-05,2021-02-25T14:13:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Natural Environments; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology; interoception; covid-19; nature; mental health; environment; emotions; allostasis,False
85,The impact of COVID-19 on anxiety and wellbeing for families of individuals with Special Education Needs and Disabilities in the UK,"COVID-19 has affected people across the world. However, it has been suggested that individuals with Special Education Needs and Disabilities (SEND) and their families might have been particularly impacted by the first national lockdown in the UK. In contrast to previous studies, the current study examined wellbeing and anxiety at different time points and included a control group matched for family situation. Parents of 402 individuals with SEND reported on their own anxiety and wellbeing as well as that of their son/daughter at three time points (before COVID-19, when COVID-19 pandemic started, and during the national lockdown). In addition, data from 186 typically developing (TD) siblings was obtained. Repeated measures ANOVAs and regression analyses showed that, although both individuals with SEND and their TD siblings showed increased anxiety across the three time points, levels of anxiety were not predicted by age, gender or health. Instead, levels of anxiety in the SEND group, but not the TD siblings, were predicted by awareness about COVID-19, diagnosis of an existing anxiety disorder as well as parental anxiety. In addition, whilst TD individuals were reported to increasingly worry about social related issues as well as family related issues, those with SEND were reported to worry about issues related to school closures. These findings show that COVID-19 impacts the wellbeing of those with SEND differently to that of their TD siblings and that school closures have a particular effect on this group. Further implications for policy impact and interventions are discussed.",Vasileios Sideropoulos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E3-658-624,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E3-658-624,2021-02-03,2021-02-25T14:13:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Cognitive Development; covid-19; predictors; send; worries; special educational needs and disabilities (send); anxiety; wellbeing,False

87,"Home-schooling during COVID-19 lockdown: Effects of coping style, home space, and everyday creativity on stress and home-schooling outcomes","The present study examined parents’ experiences of home-schooling their children during the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. A total of 322 parents completed an online survey between the 1st May and the 24th July 2020. Relationships were explored between predictor variables (coping mechanisms, household income, adequacy of space) and outcome variables (parenting self-efficacy, discipline, home-schooling relationships) mediated by stress and moderated by creativity and parenting dimensions. Moderated mediation analyses showed that inadequate space at home and negative coping mechanisms resulted in elevated stress and worse outcomes in terms of parents approaches to discipline and their experience of home-schooling their children. Negative outcomes were more pronounced for parents who used high levels of behavioural control. In turn, negative outcomes were reduced when parents had higher levels of self-perceived everyday creativity and outcomes were improved by positive coping strategies.

88,Viral Tunes: Changes in musical behaviours and interest in coronamusic predict socio-emotional coping during COVID-19 lockdown,"Beyond immediate health risks, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a variety of stressors, which may require expensive or unavailable strategies during a pandemic (e.g., therapy, socialising). Here we asked whether musical engagement is an effective strategy for socio-emotional coping. During the first lockdown period (April-May 2020), we surveyed changes in music listening and making behaviours of over 5000 people, with representative samples from 3 continents. More than half of respondents reported using music to cope. People experiencing increased negative emotions used music for solitary emotional regulation, whereas people experiencing increased positive emotions used music as a proxy for social interaction. Light gradient-boosted regressor models were used to identify the most important predictors of an individual’s use of music to cope, the foremost of which was, intriguingly, their interest in the novel genre of “coronamusic.” Overall, our results emphasise the importance of real-time musical responses to societal crises, as well as individually tailored adaptations in musical behaviours to meet socio-emotional needs.",Lauren Fink et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-6E0-C09,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-6E0-C09,2021-01-09,2021-02-25T14:10:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Music; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; music; coronamusic; big data; emotions; covid-19; coping; machine learning; social; wellbeing; lockdown,False

90,Big Five personality traits and COVID-19 precautionary behaviors among older adults in Europe,"Objectives: Taking precaution against COVID-19 is important particularly among older adults who have a greater risk for severe illness if infected. We examined whether Big Five personality traits are associated with COVID-19 precautionary behaviors among older adults in Europe. Method: We used data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (N=34 801). Personality was self-reported in 2017 using the BFI-10 inventory. COVID-19 precautionary behaviors – wearing a mask, limiting social contacts, and keeping distance to others – were assessed in the summer of 2020 through self-reports. Associations between personality and precautionary behaviors were examined with multilevel random-intercept logistic regression models. The models were adjusted for age, gender, educational attainment, and country of residence. Results: Higher conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness were associated with a greater likelihood of wearing a face mask. Higher neuroticism was associated with a greater likelihood of limiting social contacts, and higher agreeableness with a lower likelihood of limiting social contacts. Higher conscientiousness was associated with a greater likelihood of keeping distance to others. The associations between personality and practicing precautionary behaviors were relatively weak. Discussion: Among older adults, taking COVID-19 precautionary behaviors was most consistently related to higher conscientiousness and neuroticism, suggesting that precautionary behaviors may be motivated by multiple psychological differences.",Jaakko Airaksinen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C9-FC6-959,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C9-FC6-959,2021-01-14,2021-02-25T14:06:24+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; older adults; personality; covid-19; big five; social distancing; face mask",False
91,Your Health vs. My Liberty: Philosophical beliefs dominated reflection and identifiable victim effects when predicting public health recommendation compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic,"In response to crises, people sometimes prioritize fewer specific identifiable victims over many unspecified statistical victims. How other factors can explain this bias remains unclear. So two experiments investigated how complying with public health recommendations during the COVID19 pandemic depended on victim portrayal, reflection, and philosophical beliefs (Total N = 998). Only one experiment found that messaging about individual victims increased compliance compared to messaging about statistical victims—i.e., ""flatten the curve"" graphs—an effect that was undetected after controlling for other factors. However, messaging about flu (vs. COVID19) indirectly reduced compliance by reducing perceived threat of the pandemic. Nevertheless, moral beliefs predicted compliance better than messaging and reflection in both experiments. The second experiment’s additional measures revealed that religiosity, political preferences, and beliefs about science also predicted compliance. This suggests that flouting public health recommendations may be less about ineffective messaging or reasoning than philosophical differences.",Nick Byrd et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-721-44F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-721-44F,2020-07-23,2021-02-24T13:40:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; experimental philosophy; numeracy; health psychology; cognitive reflection test; effective altruism; moral psychology; covid19,False
92,Factors associated with violence against women following the COVID-19 lockdown in France: Results from a prospective online survey,"Background: The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 17th - May 11th 2020) on violence against women in France. Methods: A prospective survey was conducted online between April 2th 2020 and July 5th 2020. Female respondents were recruited from social media networks using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected three times: during (2-19 April) and at the end (11-25 May) of the first lockdown, and following the first lockdown (20 June – 05 July). Sociodemographic variables, lockdown living conditions, financial impact of COVID, and history of psychiatric disorder were evaluated, together with changes in psychological distress over the lockdown period, and the risk of being assaulted post lockdown. Results: Psychological distress was elevated and remained stable for most of the 1538 female respondents during lockdown. More than 7% of women were affected by physical or sexual violence post lockdown. Unwanted sexual contact accounted for the majority of abuse, but physical and sexual assault were also prevalent. The risk of being abused was higher for participants who had changed anxiety/insomnia symptoms over the lockdown period, and a history of abuse. Discussion: Women who experienced changes in anxiety/insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown were at higher risk than others of being assaulted post lockdown, especially when they were already socially vulnerable. While social and psychological factors accounting for these changes warrant further investigation, communication and preventive measures during pandemics should include initiatives tailored to women more vulnerable to violence.",William Peraud et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621A-8A6-6E1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621A-8A6-6E1,2021-02-23,2021-02-23T20:35:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; longitudinal study; public health; violence; covid-19; psychosocial factors,False
93,Nowhere to go: Parents' descriptions of children's physical activity during a global pandemic,"Background: Schools and outdoor public spaces play a substantial role in children’s physical activity. Yet, the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates bound many children to their available home spaces for learning, movement, and development. The exact effect this mandate had on children’s physical activity may vary among families. Objective: To understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children’s physical activity, while also considering families’ socioeconomic status Design: Open-ended survey Setting: Online Method: Data were collected from 335 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children’s opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children’s physical activity through their involvement and encouragement. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of access to outdoor spaces and equipment for increasing children’s physical activity. Findings can be used by educators and policy makers to equitably support families of lower socioeconomic status who reported less access to outdoor spaces.",Deanna Perez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-324-6C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-324-6C1,2020-12-17,2021-02-22T22:36:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; health; active play; covid-19; children; families,False
94,Is our perception of the spread of COVID-19 inherently inaccurate?,"One of the most fundamental insights into the nature of our subjective perception of the world around us is that it is not veridical. In other words, we tend to not perceive information about the world around us accurately. Instead, our brains interpret new information through a host of innate and learned mechanisms that can introduce bias and distortions One of the best studied mechanisms that guide – and distort – our perception is the psychophysical Weber-Fechner law. According to this empirically derived, mathematically formulated law we tend to put more emphasis on smaller deviations in size while underestimating larger changes. The original formulation of the Weber-Fechner law takes the shape of a logarithmic function and is commonly applied to somatosensory perception such as the weight of an object. However, later work showed that the Weber-Fechner law can be generalized and describe a large variety of perceived changes in magnitude that even go beyond the sensory domain. Here we investigate the hypothesis that our perception of data associated with the spread of COVID-19 and similar pandemics is governed by the same psychophysical laws. Based on several recently published studies, we demonstrate that the Weber-Fechner law can be shown to directly affect the decision-making of officials in response to this global crisis as well as the greater public at large. We discuss how heightened awareness of the non-linear nature of subjective perception could help alleviate problematic judgements in similar situations in the future.",Alexander Maier,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46227-444-62E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46227-444-62E,2021-02-22,2021-02-22T21:08:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception,False

This study aimed to explore the validity and usefulness of the Stress and Anxiety to the Viral Epidemic-6 items (SAVE-6) scale for measuring the anxiety response to the viral epidemic of the general population. A total of 1,009 respondents participated in an online survey, and 501 (49.7%) participants were rated as having at least a mild degree of anxiety response to the viral epidemic (SAVE-6 score ≥ 15), whereas 90 (8.9%) and 91 (9.0%) were rated as having depression and anxiety, respectively. The SAVE-6 scales showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = .82). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a one-factor structure for the measure. Goodness-of-fit indices (χ2/df ratio = 19.1, CFI = .92; TLI = .86; SRMR = 0.05; RMSEA = .13) were adequate.

97,“Instruments are good at eliciting information; scores are very dangerous”: The perspectives of clinical professionals regarding neurodevelopmental assessment,"Clinical judgment is a crucial part of autism and ADHD assessments. Sociological and psychological discourses, amongst others, offer accounts of this phenomenon. Yet these discourses tend to proceed along parallel tramlines. This study aims to harness insights from psychology and sociology to explore clinical perspectives and assessment practices of autism and ADHD through qualitative interviews with experienced health care professionals (HCPs). Qualitative interviews were conducted with HCPs (n=17), each of whom had at least three years of post-qualification experience working with children with neurodevelopmental conditions. Interviews were conducted between January and May 2019. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Themes were sorted into two interrelated categories i) approaches to diagnosis ii) elements of diagnosis. Approaches to diagnosis were comprised of the following subthemes: nature of diagnosis, application of diagnosis: natural and pragmatic, revisiting conceptualisations: sub-optimal practice & unhelpful diagnoses, autism and ADHD. Elements of diagnosis contained three related subthemes: ‘contextualising standardised assessments’, triangulating material, organisational factors. It is argued that the oft-cited tension between evidence-based assessment and clinical judgment represents a false opposition. There is sometimes a pragmatic as well as nosological dimension to diagnosis. Competing desires for consistency and utility add further complexity to neurodevelopmental assessment.",Barry Coughlan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-2A6-A63,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-2A6-A63,2021-02-17,2021-02-22T03:39:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Decision Making; clinical reasoning; diagnosis; adhd; autism; assessment,False
98,Prospective Examination of Adolescent Sleep Patterns and Behaviors Before and During COVID-19,"Study Objectives: To prospectively examine changes in adolescent sleep before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents with and without ADHD. Methods: Participants were 122 adolescents (ages 15-17; 61% male; 48% with ADHD). Parents reported on adolescents’ sleep duration and difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS); adolescents reported on sleep patterns, sleep duration, delayed sleep/wake behaviors, and daytime sleepiness before (September 2019-February 2020) and during (May-June 2020) COVID-19. Adolescents also reported on their health behaviors, COVID-19-related negative affect, and difficulties concentrating due to COVID-19. Results: Parents reported adolescents had more DIMS during COVID-19 than before COVID-19, with clinically-elevated rates increasing from 24% to 36%. Both bedtimes and waketimes shifted later during COVID-19, and adolescents reported more delayed sleep/wake behaviors. Adolescents also reported less daytime sleepiness and longer school night sleep duration during COVID-19. In considering differences between adolescents with and without ADHD, adolescents with ADHD did not experience an increase in school night sleep duration and were less likely to obtain recommended sleep duration during COVID-19. In the full sample, controlling for ADHD status, COVID-19-related sadness/loneliness was associated with increases in DIMS, and spending less time outside and more COVID-19-related worries/fears were associated with increases in delayed sleep/wake behaviors during COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19 had negative and positive impacts on adolescent sleep. Adolescents with ADHD did not experience the benefit of increased school night sleep duration during COVID-19 like adolescents without ADHD. Negative affect and health behaviors may be useful intervention targets for reducing negative impacts of COVID-19 for adolescent sleep.",Stephen P.

99,The COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale: Validation and Measurement Invariance in Female and Male Caregivers,"The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns regarding the effect of social disruptions on parental mental health, family well-being, and children’s adjustment. Due to the pace of the pandemic, measures of pandemic-related disruption have not been subject to rigorous empirical validation. To address this gap, a multi-national sample (United Kingdom, 76%; United States, 19%; Canada, 4%, and Australia, 1%) of 372 female caregivers and 158 male caregivers of 5-18 year-old children was recruited online. Participants completed a survey including a 25-item scale indexing disruption in finances, basic needs, personal and family welfare, career/education, household responsibilities, and family relationships related to the pandemic. An exploratory factor analysis yielded an optimal three-factor solution: factors included Income Stress (5 items related to income, debt, and job loss; loadings ranged from .57 to .91), Family Stress (7 items related to family altercations and child management; loadings from .57 to .87), and Chaos Stress (4 items related to access to supplies, crowded shopping areas, news coverage; loadings from .53 to .70). Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated measurement invariance of each factor across female and male caregivers, indicating that factor structure, loadings, and thresholds were equivalent across groups. Composites reflective of each factor were computed, and paired samples t-tests showed that female caregivers consistently report higher levels of COVID-19 stress related to income, family, and chaos compared to male caregivers. Finally, concurrent validity was demonstrated by significant bivariate correlations between each scale and indicators of parental and child mental health and family relationships. This demonstrates validity of the COVID-19 Family Stressor Scale for use with female and male caregivers in family-based research. The current sample was predominantly White-European.

100,A Test of Resilience Theory in the Context of a Global Crisis,"Major stressors often challenge emotional well-being—increasing negative emotions and decreasing positive emotions. But how long do these emotional hits last? Prior theory and research contain conflicting views. Some research suggests that most individuals’ emotional well-being will return to, or even surpass, baseline levels relatively quickly. Others have challenged this view, arguing that this type of resilient response is uncommon. The present research provides a strong test of resilience theory by examining emotional trajectories over the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In two pre-registered longitudinal studies conducted in diverse U.S. samples (total N =1,147), we examined overall emotional trajectories and predictors of individual differences in emotional trajectories across 13 waves of data from February through September 2020. The pandemic had immediate detrimental effects on emotional well-being. Negative emotions decreased across six months, with the greatest improvements occurring almost immediately. Yet, positive emotions remained depleted relative to baseline levels, illustrating the limits of resilience. Individuals also differed substantially around these normative emotional trajectories and these individual differences were predicted by socio-demographic characteristics and stress exposure. We discuss three theoretical implications of the present investigation: (1) The extent to which resilience is normative depends on the outcome and the context. (2) Individual differences in resilience are large and complex, suggesting that broad claims that resilience is “ubiquitous” or “rare” may not be useful. (3) Resilience is multiply-determined and embedded within societal contexts that influence who experiences stress as well as who has access to resources to respond to stress.",Emily C Willroth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46235-ADF-467,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46235-ADF-467,2021-02-19,2021-02-20T18:18:34+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; covid-19; emotional trajectories; trajectories; risk and protective factors; resilience",False
101,A Review and Response to the Early Mental Health and Neurological Consequences of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"COVID-19 has infected millions of people and upended the lives of most humans on the planet. Researchers from across the psychological sciences have sought to document and investigate the impact of COVID-19 in myriad ways, causing an explosion of research that is broad in scope, varied in methods, and challenging to consolidate. Because policy and practice aimed at helping people live healthier and happier lives requires insight from robust patterns of evidence, this paper provides a rapid and thorough summary of high-quality studies published in 2020 addressing two overarching questions. First, what are the mental health consequences of living through the COVID-19 pandemic? Second, what are the neurological sequelae of contracting COVID-19? Our review of the evidence indicates that some facets of mental health suffered greatly during the early months of the pandemic (e.g., anxiety and depression increased), while other facets (life satisfaction) and correlates (social connection, loneliness) notably displayed resilience. In addition, early neurological data indicate several consequences of contracting COVID-19, both during infection and after recovery. In response to these insights, we present seven recommendations (1 urgent, 2 short-term, 4 ongoing) to support mental health and well-being during the pandemic and beyond.",Lara Beth Aknin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-E74-2D7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-E74-2D7,2021-02-19,2021-02-20T18:13:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; happiness; self-harm; mental health; social connection; covid-19; well-being; loneliness,False
102,Digital language learning: Lessons learned from Japanese natives who became Japanese online teachers during the worldwide restrictions in 2020,"This qualitative study analyses 10 Japanese native speakers who became online teachers of Japanese during the COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. The data allow for deep qualitative analysis of native speakers and focus on the reasons for becoming a language teacher, circumstances forcing them to shift work and opportunity to continue or quit online teaching after the restrictions abate. The main questions discussed are (1) the motivation to continue with Japanese online teaching even when returning to a prior position is possible, (2) unexpected experiences while being a Japanese teacher and (3) advantages and disadvantages of teaching their mother tongue. The paper analyses Japanese teachers’ feelings, hopes and motivations related to their new profession and implications for further changes in language teaching, digital work and other areas of digital education. The evaluation demonstrated that the threshold for becoming a Japanese teacher has significantly decreased because of online platforms. However, long-term implementation depends on personal characteristics and determines whether untrained Japanese teachers succeed in their teaching activities and thus become a competition for trained Japanese teachers. The signs of a significant change in Japanese teaching are visible, but the human component cannot be ignored in digital language teaching.",Stefanie Siebenhütter,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-51C-F6F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-51C-F6F,2021-02-20,2021-02-20T18:11:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-esteem; working under stress; digital language learning; online teaching; japanese as a foreign language; teachers attitudes; qualitative research,False
103,Identifying resilience factors of distress and paranoia during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has affected all countries with more than 100 million confirmed cases and over 2.1 million casualties by the end of January 2021 worldwide. A prolonged pandemic can harm global levels of optimism, regularity, and sense of meaning and belonging of people, yielding adverse effects on individual's mental health as represented by worry, paranoia, and distress. Here we studied resilience, a successful adaptation despite risk and adversity, in five countries: Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Israel and Norway. In April 2020, over 2500 participants were recruited for an observational study measuring protective and obstructive factors for mental health. More than 800 of these participants also completed a follow-up study in July. We found that thriving, keeping a regular schedule, engaging in physical exercise and less procrastination served as factors protecting mental well-being. Risk factors were financial worries and a more negative mindset, e.g. feeling a lack of control. Longitudinally, we found no increase in distress or paranoia despite an increase in expectation how long the outbreak and the restrictions will last, suggesting respondents engaged in healthy coping and adapting their life to the new circumstances. Thus, our data shines some light on the mostly depressive news during the pandemic. Humans adapt and despite adversity there are protective factors that policy makers should leverage on.",Martin Jensen Mækelæ et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46188-7B1-7FE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46188-7B1-7FE,2021-02-20,2021-02-20T18:11:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods,False

To maximize its effectiveness, it is paramount to investigate psychological factors that predict adherence to social distancing guidelines and examine corresponding interventions. We focused on individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom, and tested an intervention based on if-then planning. Design: We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study combining observational and experimental methods. Methods: Participants (N = 574, 35.7% female, age: M = 37.5 years, SD = 10.8) reported their adherence to social distancing guidelines and the perceived difficulty of adherence at T1, along with trait measures of if-then planning, self-control, and boredom. Afterwards, they were randomly assigned to an if-then planning intervention to increase adherence, or to a control intervention. One week later at T2, participants again reported their adherence and the perceived difficulty of adhering. Multiple regression and structural equation modeling were used to establish whether trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence, and to examine the effects of the if-then planning intervention. Results: Trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom were associated with T1 adherence, while only if-then planning and boredom predicted T2 adherence. No overall treatment effect of the if-then planning intervention emerged; however, participants who complied with the intervention (75.6%) maintained higher levels of adherence over time than control participants. Conclusions: Individual differences in if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predict adherence to social distancing guidelines. If-then planning interventions are promising but require further steps to ascertain compliance.",Maik Bieleke et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BC-369-630,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BC-369-630,2020-06-25,2021-02-19T10:03:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; boredom; covid-19; self-control; if-then planning; social distancing,False
105,"Social touch deprivation during COVID-19: effects on psychological wellbeing, tolerating isolation and craving interpersonal touch","Social touch has positive effects on social affiliation and stress alleviation. However, its ubiquitous presence in human life does not allow the study of social touch deprivation ‘in the wild’. Nevertheless, COVID-19-related restrictions such as social distancing allowed the systematic study of the degree to which social distancing affects tactile experiences and mental health. In this study, 1746 participants completed an online-survey to examine intimate, friendly and professional touch experiences during COVID-19-related restrictions, their impact on mental health and the extent to which touch deprivation results in craving touch. We found that intimate touch deprivation during COVID-19-related restrictions is associated with worse psychological wellbeing, even though this type of touch is still the most experienced during the pandemic. Moreover, intimate touch is reported as the type of touch most craved during this period, thus being more prominent as the days practicing social distancing increase. However, our results also show that the degree to which individuals crave touch during this period depends on individual differences in attachment style: the more anxiously-attached, the more touch is craved; with the reverse pattern for avoidantly-attached. These findings point to the important role of interpersonal and particularly intimate touch in times of distress and uncertainty.",Mariana Von Mohr et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-90C-C36,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-90C-C36,2021-02-18,2021-02-18T22:51:06+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Touch, Taste, and Smell; covid-19; social touch; wellbeing; anxiety; attachment",False
106,Individual differences in the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on optimism and meaning in life,"We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on optimism and meaning in life in a sample of the Netherlands Twin Register. Participants completed questions before (N=9964) and during the pandemic (N= 17464). A subsample completed both (N=6461). We applied twin models to investigate changes in the genetic architecture due to the pandemic. Around 15-20% of the sample was negatively affected by the pandemic, but the majority was stable (64-68%) or increased (15%) in optimism and meaning in life. Especially women, higher educated people, and people with poorer health experienced negative effects. Twin modelling indicated stable genetic variance and increasing person-specific environmental variance. The lower than unity genetic correlations across time (.75 and .63) suggest gene-environment interactions. Some people decrease in well-being, while others get more optimistic and consider their lives as more meaningful during the pandemic. These differences are partly explained by individual differences in genetic sensitivity.",Lianne De Vries et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46091-364-57F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46091-364-57F,2021-02-18,2021-02-18T22:43:25+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; pandemic; optimism; meaning in life; covid-19; heritability; lockdown",False
107,Two-year-olds use past experiences to accomplish novel goals,"Memory-guided planning involves retrieving relevant memories and applying that information in service of a goal. Previous studies have shown substantial development in this ability between the ages of 3 and 4 years. We investigated the emergence of memory-guided planning by asking whether 2-year-olds could draw on episodic memories of past experiences to generate and execute plans. In Experiments 1 and 2, 2-year-olds successfully did so, and this ability developed significantly across the 3rd year. Furthermore, in Experiment 3 (n=19, d=.63), 2-year-olds successfully applied episodic memories to guide plans in a novel problem context, suggesting flexibility in this ability. Together, these results suggest that some form of memory-guided planning emerges in the 3rd year of life and may form the cognitive basis for episodic prospection later in development.",Tashauna Blankenship et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600A-E29-0C0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600A-E29-0C0,2021-02-18,2021-02-18T22:28:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Cognitive Development; planning; learning; generalization; episodic memory,False
108,Social representations of the Coronavirus and causal perception of its origin. The role of reasons for fear.,"In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic (between 26 March and 2 April 2020), we analysed (n=1144) the social representations of the coronavirus and the differentiated perceptions according to the origins attributed to the appearance of the virus (Human vs Non-Human and Intentional vs. Unintentional) in a French population. The results show that the social representation is organized around five potentially central descriptive, anxiety-provoking and globally negative elements. But death and contagion are the only stable and structuring elements. The other elements vary according to the reason attributed to the object of fear. Depending on how individuals attribute the origin of the virus, social representations of it vary not only in terms of their content but also in terms of their structure. These results indicate how important it is to consider the perceptions that individuals share about the human (vs. non-human) and intentional (vs. unintentional) origin of an object of fear in the analysis of their representation of that object.",Patrick Rateau et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46032-04E-CA8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46032-04E-CA8,2021-02-18,2021-02-18T22:25:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social thinking; collective fear; france; covid-19; social representations,False
109,Individual Motives for Security Influence Sexual Activity During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Amidst a global pandemic, people’ survival needs become salient and the ability for people to regulate feeling and actions might be particularly relevant to protecting oneself from harm. Regulatory Focus Theory (Higgins, 1998) proposes that people pursue their goals by having a focus on prevention (i.e., motivated by security) or promotion (i.e., motivated by pleasure). Prior research indicates that people focused on prevention (vs. promotion) are more likely to engage in health-protective behaviors, including sexual health behaviors, because they perceive more threats. Extending this reasoning to the sexual activity of single people during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a pre-registered longitudinal study (N = 174) examining the role of regulatory focus on people’s sexual behaviors. As hypothesized, results showed that single people who reported having a more prevention focus at the onset of the pandemic perceived greater threats caused by the pandemic two weeks later, which, in turn, predicted less frequent sexual activity and engagement in sex with fewer sexual partners the following two weeks. These effects were consistent even when controlling for promotion (i.e., pleasure motivations), personality, gender, and sexual orientation. Findings are discussed considering their implications for the sexual functioning and sexual health of single people.",David L.

110,Polygenic Score for Smoking is associated with Externalizing Psychopathology and Disinhibited Personality Traits but not Internalizing Psychopathology in Adolescence,"Importance: Large consortia of genome wide association studies have yielded more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate the small effects of many genetic variants to characterize the genetic architecture of disorders and provide a personalized measure of genetic risk. Objective: We examined whether a PRS for smoking measured genetic risk for general behavioral disinhibition by estimating its associations with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and related personality traits. We examined these associations at multiple time points in adolescence using more refined phenotypes defined by stable characteristics across time and at young ages, which reduced potential confounds associated with cumulative exposure to substances and reverse causality. Methods: Random intercept panel models were fit to symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems and personality traits at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old in the Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 3225). Results: The smoking PRS had strong associations with the random intercept factors for all the externalizing measures (mean standardized ꞵ = .27), agreeableness (ꞵ=-.22, 95% CI: -.28, -.16), and conscientiousness (ꞵ=-.19, 95% CI: -.24, -.13), but was not significantly associated with the internalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .06) or extraversion (ꞵ=.01, 95% CI: -.05, .07). After controlling for smoking at age 17, the associations with the externalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .13) and personality traits related to behavioral control (mean ꞵ = -.10) remained statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The smoking PRS measures genetic influences that contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition including externalizing psychopathology and normal-range personality traits related to behavioral control, but not internalizing psychopathology. Continuing to identify the correlates and delineate the mechanisms of the genetic influences associated with disinhibition could have substantial impact in mitigating a variety of public health problems (e.g., mental health, academic achievement, criminality).",Brian M.

111,Disease and Disapproval: COVID-19 Concern is Related to Greater Moral Condemnation,"Prior research has indicated that disease threat and disgust are associated with harsher moral condemnation. We investigated the role of a specific, highly salient health concern, namely the spread of the coronavirus, and associated COVID-19 disease, on moral condemnation. We hypothesized that individuals who report greater subjective worry about COVID-19 would be more sensitive to moral transgressions. Across 3 studies (N = 913), conducted March-May 2020 as the pandemic started to unfold in the United States, we found that individuals who were worried about contracting the infectious disease made harsher moral judgments than those who were relatively less worried. This effect was not restricted to transgressions involving purity, but extended to transgressions involving harm, fairness, authority, and loyalty, and remained when controlling for political orientation. Furthermore, for Studies 1 and 2 the effect also was robust when taking into account the contamination subscale of the Disgust Scale—Revised. These findings add to the growing literature that concrete threats to health can play a role in abstract moral considerations, supporting the notion that judgments of wrongdoing are not based on rational thought alone.",Robert K.

112,Remote Cognitive Assessment in Severe Mental Illness: A Scoping Review,"Many individuals living with severe mental illness present cognitive deficits and reasoning biases negatively impacting clinical and functional trajectories. Within the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians and researchers must adapt traditional in-person assessments for remote delivery, but little guidance is available for this endeavor. To synthesize the literature and facilitate guideline development, we conducted a scoping review of remote cognitive assessment in severe mental illness. Overall, 34 studies (n = 20,813 clinical participants) were reviewed and remote measures, psychometrics, facilitators, barriers, and future directions were synthesized using a logic model. We identified 82 measures assessing cognition in severe mental illness across 11 cognitive domains and four device platforms. Remote measures were generally comparable to traditional versions, though psychometric properties were infrequently reported. Facilitators included standardized procedures and wider recruitment, whereas barriers included imprecise measure adaptations, technology inaccessibility, low patient engagement and poor digital literacy. Our review identified several remote cognitive measures in psychiatry across all cognitive domains. However, there is a need for more rigorous validation of these measures and consideration of potential influential factors, such as sex and gender. We provide recommendations for conducting remote cognitive assessment in psychiatry and fostering high quality research using digital technologies.",Katie M.

113,Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review,"Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level.

114,Allocation of COVID-19 vaccination: When public prioritization preferences differ from official regulations,"As vaccines against COVID-19 are scarce, many countries have developed vaccination prioritization strategies focusing on ethical and epidemiological considerations. However, public acceptance of such strategies should be monitored to ensure successful implementation. In an experiment with N = 1,379 German participants, we investigated whether the public’s vaccination allocation preferences matched the prioritization strategy approved by the German government. Results revealed different allocations. While the government had top-prioritized vulnerable people (being of high age or accommodated in nursing homes for the elderly), participants deprioritized these groups and preferred exclusive allocation of the first available vaccines to medical staff and personnel caring for the elderly. Interestingly, allocation preferences did not change when participants were told how many individuals were included in each group. As differences between allocation policies and public preferences can affect trust in the government and threaten the social contract between generations, we discuss possible strategies to align vaccination prioritizations.",Philipp Sprengholz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AB-EB7-D80,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AB-EB7-D80,2021-02-17,2021-02-17T17:43:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
115,Transparency and Reproducibility-related Reporting Practices in Meta-analyses on the Effectiveness of Psychological Interventions,"Meta-analysis is a powerful and important tool to synthesize the literature about a research topic. Like other kinds of research, meta-analyses must be reproducible to be compliant with the principles of the scientific method. Furthermore, reproducible meta-analyses can be easily updated with new data and reanalysed applying new and more refined analysis techniques. We attempted to empirically assess the prevalence of transparency and reproducibility-related reporting practices in published meta-analyses from clinical psychology by examining a random sample of 100 meta-analyses. Our purpose was to identify the key points that could be improved with the aim to provide some recommendations to carry out reproducible meta-analyses. We conducted a meta-review of meta-analyses of psychological interventions published between 2000 and 2019. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science databases. A structured coding form to assess transparency indicators was created based on previous studies and existing meta-analysis guidelines. We found major issues concerning: completely reproducible search procedures report, specification of the exact method to compute effect sizes, choice of weighting factors and estimators, lack of availability of the raw statistics used to compute the effect size and of interoperability of available data, and practically total absence of analysis script code sharing.

116,"How Does The COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Population Mental Health? A Network Analysis of COVID Influences On Depression, Anxiety and Traumatic Stress in the UK Population","Background. The COVID-19 emergency has led to numerous attempts to assess the impact of the pandemic on population mental health. Findings indicate an increase in depression and anxiety but have been limited by the lack of specificity about which aspects of the pandemic (e.g. viral exposure or economic threats) have led to adverse mental health outcomes. Methods. Network analyses were conducted on data from wave 1 (N = 2025 recruited March 23rd – March 28th 2020) and wave 2 (N = 1406 recontacts, 22 April – 1 May 2020) of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium Study, an online longitudinal survey of a representative sample of the UK adult population. Our models included depression (PHQ-9), generalised anxiety (GAD-7) and trauma symptoms (ITQ) and also measures of Covid-specific anxiety, exposure to the virus in self and close others as well as economic loss due to the pandemic. Results. A mixed graphical model at wave 1 indicated that economic adversity impacted on anxiety symptoms via specific anxiety about the pandemic. There was no association between viral exposure and symptoms. Ising network models using clinical cut-offs for symptom scores at each wave yielded similar findings with the exception of a modest effect of viral exposure on trauma symptoms at wave 1 only. Anxiety and depression symptoms formed separate clusters at wave 1 but not wave 2. Conclusions. The psychological impact of the pandemic evolved in the early phase of lockdown.

117,The Impact of School Closure and Social Isolation on Children in Vulnerable Families during COVID-19: A Focus on Children’s Reactions,"The COVID-19 public health measures may have long-term consequences for children into adulthood. By exploring children’s reactions more broadly, including both positive and negative reactions, we are better placed to understanding the breadth of implications of home school and social isolation under COVID-19. The present study explored how COVID-19 related variables including home school experience, family stress and instability, screen time use, missing friends and worry about virus infection are associated with children’s emotional, somatic/cognitive and worry reactions, respectively. Data were drawn from the longitudinal [study name blinded for peer review]-study and a series of hierarchical linear regression models were applied controlling for children’s gender, age and psychological vulnerability. Results showed significant associations between all three outcomes and all COVID-19 related predictors, except for screen time use. Further, age moderated several of these associations and older children were more negatively impacted (i.e., higher level of reported reactions). The present study provides more conclusive evidence of the effects of home school and social isolation under COVID-19 on children’s.

118,Assessing Self-Other Distinctions Through Decision-making Under Risk in The Era of Covid-19,"The current Covid-19 pandemic has demanded a degree of sacrifice from individuals for the sake of the greater good. Individuals have taken costly actions, both volitional and imposed, to reduce harm to strangers. The pandemic oers a unique opportunity to examine a fundamental question: where does the distinction between self and other lie? This question can be framed as a moral dilemma between competing motives of self-serving and pro-social behavior. Given the multifaceted uncer- tainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, we propose to assess self-other distinction using models of decision-making under risk. We administered two surveys, where participants selected between sure and risky treatments for fictitious diseases, for themselves, a loved one and a stranger. Choice of treatment option showed risk-seeking tendencies that decreased with expected disease severity, across all targets, suggesting risk preferences for the other parallel those for the self. However, distinctions across targets emerged when decisions were conditioned on treatment cost, with sure treatments cho- sen more often for self and a close other; and sure treatment assigned a higher price for diseases with low expected severity, for self and other. These findings inform on what constitutes a measure of self-other distinction; and the limits of what can be asked of an individual in service to a stranger.",Leyla Loued-Khenissi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-DA1-4AD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-DA1-4AD,2020-11-27,2021-02-16T14:24:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Behavioral Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; risk; decision-making; self-other distinction; covid-19 pandemic,False
119,Exploring the Association between Compliance with Measures to Prevent the Spread of COVID-19 and Big Five Traits with Bayesian Generalized Linear Model,"Research has examined the association between people’s compliance with measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and personality traits. However, previous studies were conducted with relatively small-size datasets and employed frequentist analysis that does not allow data-driven model exploration. To address the limitations, a large-scale international dataset, COVIDiSTRESS Global Survey dataset, was explored with Bayesian generalized linear model that enables identification of the best regression model. The best regression models predicting participants’ compliance with Big Five traits were explored. The findings demonstrated first, all Big Five traits, except extroversion, were positively associated with compliance with general measures and distancing. Second, neuroticism, extroversion, and agreeableness were positively associated with the perceived cost of complying with the measures while conscientiousness showed negative association. The findings and the implications of the present study were discussed.",Hyemin Han,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-299-BE8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-299-BE8,2021-02-13,2021-02-15T20:51:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; big five; big data; bayesian analysis; covid-19; data-driven analysis; physical distancing; preventive measures,False
120,The role of personality in shaping pandemic response: Systemic sociopolitical factors drive country differences,"The current study utilizes the current COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of external political and economic factors in personality public-health research. We investigated the extent to which systemic factors modify the relationship between personality and pandemic response. Results shed doubt on the cross-cultural generalizability of common big-five factor models. Individual differences only predicted government compliance in autocratic countries and in countries with income inequality. Personality was only predictive of mental health outcomes under conditions of state fragility and autocracy. Finally, there was little evidence that the big five traits were associated with preventive behaviors. Our ability to use individual differences to understand policy-relevant outcomes changes based on environmental factors and must be assessed on a trait-by-trait basis, thus supporting the inclusion of systemic political and economic factors in individual differences models.",Meghan Siritzky et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-8FA-A5B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-8FA-A5B,2020-08-31,2021-02-15T19:05:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; democracy; gini; personality; autocracy; pandemic; polity; covid-19; state fragility; health behavior; individual differences,False
121,Emotional Reactivity and Wellbeing of Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Short and Long Term Effects and The Impact of Social and Socioeconomic Stressors,"Adolescence is a formative period for socio-emotional development which is threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal study examined the impact of the pandemic on young people’s mood, emotional reactivity, and wellbeing (i.e., operationalized as balancing needs of self and others). Hence, we conducted an online two-week daily diary study among 462 Dutch adolescents (Mage = 15.27 years, 64% females) and 371 young adults (Mage = 21.49 years, 81% females) in May 2020, with a follow-up to study long-term effects in November 2020 (N = 238 and 231, respectively adolescents and young adults). In May 2020, young adults and older relative to younger adolescents showed higher levels and more fluctuations in tension and depression and lower levels of vigor. Vigor levels decreased and tension and depression levels increased between May 2020 and November 2020, especially for younger adolescents. A closer examination in the adolescent sample, revealed positive associations between instability of negative emotions (i.e. tension and depression fluctuations) and the exposure to social and socioeconomic stressors (i.e. family stress and inequality of online homeschooling). Together, this study demonstrates vulnerability regarding young people’s mood and emotional reactivity during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for adolescents who experience more stressors.",Kayla Green et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-D6E-037,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-D6E-037,2021-02-15,2021-02-15T16:55:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; young adulthood; adolescence; covid-19; mood; wellbeing; socioeconomic stressors; emotional reactvity; family,False
122,In Masks we Trust: Explicit and Implicit Reactions to Masked Faces Vary by Voting Intention,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused controversy over new norms of mask-wearing in public places. An online experiment previously showed that people from several Spanish-speaking countries perceived faces wearing medical-style masks as more trustworthy, socially desirable, and likely to be ill, compared to control faces without a mask. We replicated and extended these methods with 1241 English-speaking participants from the UK and USA, adding questions on political orientation and voting intention, and including the online-VAAST task to test the effects of masks on an implicit reaction-time measure. The positive effects of masks on trustworthiness and social desirability were replicated, but the negative effect of masks on perceptions of healthiness was reversed. Participants were also quicker to approach masked faces. Conservative voters’ explicit and implicit reactions to masked faces were less favorable than those of liberals, demonstrating that masks are viewed positively by many but continue to be politically controversial.",Gordon Ingram et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-714-02D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-714-02D,2021-02-13,2021-02-14T06:49:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution|Survival and Psychological Adaptations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; face perception; social distance; trust; behavioral immune system; reaction times,False

Fixed effects analyses are used to investigate how the COVID-19 restrictions and involuntary homeworking affect well-being and job performance. The majority of worker well-being measures are not adversely affected. Homeworkers feel more engaged and autonomous, experience fewer negative emotions and feel more connected to their organisations.

124,Construction and Validation of a Short Multidisciplinary Research Performance Questionnaire (SMRPQ),"Research is often specialised and varies in its nature between disciplines, making it difficult to assess and compare the performance of individual researchers. Specific qualitative and quantitative indicators are usually complex and do not work equally well for different research fields. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop an economical questionnaire that is valid across disciplines. We constructed a Short Multidisciplinary Research Performance Questionnaire (SMRPQ), with which researchers can briefly report 11 quantitative and qualitative performance aspects from four areas (research quality, facilitation, transfer/exchange, and reputation) in relation to their peer reference groups (fellow researchers with the same status and discipline). To validate this questionnaire, 557 German researchers from Physics, History, and Psychology fields (53% male, 34% post-docs, 19% full professors) completed it, and for the purpose of convergent and discriminant validation additionally made assessments regarding specific quantitative and qualitative indicators of research performance as well as affective, cognitive, and behavioural aspects of their research activities (perceptions of positive affect, help-seeking, procrastination). The results attested reliable measurement, endorsed the postulated structure of the newly developed instrument, and confirmed its invariance across the three disciplines. The SMRPQ and the validation measure were strongly positively correlated, and both demonstrated similar associations with affect, cognition, and behaviour at work. Therefore, it can be considered a valid and economical approach for assessing research performance of individual researchers across different disciplines, especially within nomothetic research (e.g. regarding personal antecedents of successful research).",Martin Daumiller et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46179-948-871,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46179-948-871,2021-02-12,2021-02-13T19:52:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; assessment; performance; multidisciplinary; questionnaire; research,False
125,Moral Injury and Light Triad traits: anxiety and depression in health-care personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers are facing morally challenging, stressful, and life-threatening decisions while working with limited human and medical resources. The purpose of the current study was to determine the influence of Moral Injury and Light Triad (LT) personality traits on anxiety and depression symptoms of health-care personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. A quantitative, cross-sectional research design was used, the study included a sample of 169 health-care workers. Data was gathered through the Moral Injury Symptom Scale for Health Professionals (MISS-HP), Light Triad Scale (LTS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD-7), and the Patient-Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results suggest that almost 9 out of 10 respondents experienced at least one potentially morally injurious event, 45.6% were at significant risk of impairment related to Moral Injury. Working with limited staff and resources, and the implications of it, were among the most common potentially morally injurious situations reported by the respondents. Results suggest that MISS-HP Mistrust subscale has significant negative correlations with Light Triad traits. A hierarchical regression model determined that Moral Injury, but not Light Triad traits, significantly affected depression symptoms. The overall model accounted for 42.6% of the variance in depression scores. On the other hand, anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by Moral Injury, as did LTS-Humanism. The model accounted for 38.2% of the variance in anxiety scores. Control variables included respondents’ sex, years of experience, profession, and prior COVID-19 diagnosis.

126,Visual representation of emotions in Virtual Reality,"One of the challenges during the post-COVID pandemic era will be to foster social connections between people. Previous research suggests that people who is able to regulate their emotions tends to have better social connections with others. Additional studies indicate that it is possible to train the ability to regulate emotions voluntarily, using a procedure that involves three steps: (1) asking participants to evoke an autobiographical memory associated with a positive emotion; (2) analyze participants’ brain activity in real-time to estimate their emotional state; and (3) provide visual feedback about the emotions evoked with the autobiographical memory. However, there is not enough research on how to provide the visual feedback required for the third step. Therefore, this manuscript introduces five virtual environments that can be used to provide emotional visual feedback. Each virtual environment was designed based on evidence found in previous studies, suggesting that there are visual cues, such as colors, shapes and motion patterns, that tend to be associated with emotions. In each virtual environment, the visual cues changed, intending to represent five emotional categories. An experiment was conducted to analyze the emotions that participants associated with the virtual environments. The results indicate that each environment is associated with the emotional categories that they were meant to represent.",Andres Pinilla et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46053-796-059,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46053-796-059,2021-02-12,2021-02-13T19:41:44+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other",False
127,Stage 2 registered report: Changing health compliance through message repetition based on the extended parallel process model in the COVID-19 pandemic,"When people are confronted with health proposals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it has been suggested that fear of COVID-19 can serve protective functions and ensure public health compliance. However, health proposal repetition and its perceived efficacy also influence the behavior intention toward the proposal, which has not yet been confirmed in the COVID-19 context. The present study examined whether the extended parallel process model (EPPM) could be generalized to a naturalistic context like the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored how repetition of a health proposal is involved with the EPPM. In this study, two groups of participants were exposed to the same health proposal related to COVID-19, where one group was exposed once and another group twice. They then filled out a questionnaire consisting of items concerning behavior intention and adapted from the Risk Behavior Diagnosis Scale. Structural equation modeling was used to determine the multivariate associations between the variables. Although the results showed that behavior intention is predicted by perceived efficacy, no significant influence of perceived threat was detected. Furthermore, no significant effect of repetition was found toward either response efficacy or perceived susceptibility. These findings indicate that to promote health compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more efficient to focus on the perceived efficacy of effective health proposals rather than on the perceived threat of the disease. For future health communication research, the present study suggests improved methods for analysis strategies and repeated manipulation of messages.",Jingwen Yang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BE-A09-8EB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BE-A09-8EB,2021-02-13,2021-02-13T19:31:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; health communication; persuasiveness; covid-19; infection prevention; hand hygiene; pandemic response,False
128,Stress and worry in the 2020 coronavirus pandemic: Relationships to trust and compliance with preventive measures across 48 countries in the COVIDiSTRESS global survey,"The COVIDiSTRESS global survey collects data on early human responses to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic from 173,429 respondents in 48 countries. The open science study was co-designed by an international consortium of researchers to investigate how psychological responses differ across countries and cultures, and how this has impacted behaviour, coping and trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Starting in March 2020, COVIDiSTRESS leveraged the convenience of unpaid online recruitment to generate public data. The objective of the present analysis is to understand relationships between psychological responses in the early months of global coronavirus resreictions, and help understand how different government measures succeed or fail in changing public behaviour. There were variations between and within countries. Although Western Europeans registered as more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed, and having slightly more trust in the governments’ efforts, there was no clear geographical pattern in compliance with behavioural measures. Detailed plots illustrating between-countries differences are provided. Using both traditional and Bayesian analyses, we found that individuals who worried about getting sick worked harder to protect themselves and others. However, concern about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variance in experienced stress during the early months of coronavirus restrictions. More alarmingly, such stress was associated with less compliance. Further, those most concerned over the coronavirus trusted in government measures primarily where policies were strict. While concern over a disease is a source of mental distress, other factors including strictness of protective measures, social support, and personal lockdown conditions must also be taken into consideration to fully appreciate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to understand why some people fail to follow behavioral guidelines intended to protect themselves and others from infection.",Andreas Lieberoth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B7-59D-A18,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B7-59D-A18,2021-01-17,2021-02-13T18:44:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior,False
129,Pandemic leadership: Sex differences and their evolutionary–developmental origins,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global societal, economic, and social upheaval unseen in living memory. There have been substantial differences in the kinds of policies implemented by political decision-makers to prevent the spread of the virus, to test the population, and to manage infected patients. Among other factors, these policies vary with politicians’ sex: early findings indicate that, on average, female leaders seem more focused on minimizing direct human suffering caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while male leaders implement riskier short-term decisions, possibly aiming to minimize economic disruptions. These sex differences are consistent with broader findings in psychology, reflecting women’s stronger empathy, higher pathogen disgust, health concern, care-taking orientation, and dislike for the suffering of other people—as well as men’s higher risk-taking, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and focus on financial indicators of success and status. This review article contextualizes sex differences in pandemic leadership in an evolutionary framework. Evolution by natural selection is the only known process in nature that organizes populations of organisms into higher degrees of functional order, or counteracts the unavoidable disorder that would otherwise ensue, and is therefore essential for explaining the origins of human sex differences. Differential sexual selection and parental investment between males and females, together with the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, drive sex differences in cognition and behavioral dispositions, underlying men’s and women’s leadership styles and decision-making during a global pandemic. We propose the sexually dimorphic leadership specialization hypothesis to explain how general psychobehavioral sex differences have been exapted during human evolution to create sexually dimorphic leadership styles. They may be facultatively co-opted by societies when facing different kinds of ecological and/or sociopolitical threats, such as disease outbreaks or intergroup aggression. Early evidence indicates that against the invisible viral foe that can bring nations to their knees, the strategic circumspection of empathic feminine health “worriers” may bring more effective and humanitarian outcomes than the devil-may-care incaution of masculine risk-taking “warriors”.",Severi Luoto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-253-C9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-253-C9D,2020-11-26,2021-02-13T05:02:26+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; pandemic; population health; evolution; sexually dimorphic leadership specialization; leadership; sex differences; covid-19; cognition",False
130,"Change in mental and physical health, and social relationships, during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Australia","Background. A novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan City in China in 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic throughout 2020. Many countries around the world implemented strict social distancing policies to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020. Methods. Our survey (n = 1599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). Results. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Therefore, the psychological toll on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater COVID-19 infection rates. Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (~68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.",Shane L.

131,Idiographic network models of social media use and depression symptoms,"Disentangling the impact of social media use on our well-being is a priority for psychological research. Numerous studies indicate that active social media use (ASMU) tends to enhance well-being, whereas passive social media use (PSMU) undermines it. However, such research has conducted analyses at the group-level, thus potentially obscuring individual differences. In this study, we examined person-centered relationships between social media use and depression symptoms by using a secondary analysis of a publicly available experience sampling dataset (Aalbers et al., 2019). Dutch undergraduate students (N = 125) reported PSMU, ASMU, and depression symptoms 7 times daily for 14 days. We (a) visualized interindividual variability in temporal associations between social media use and individual depression symptoms, (b) compared the aggregate network model to idiographic models, and (c) determined the distribution of person-specific temporal associations between PSMU, ASMU, and depression symptoms. Overall, we found that associations between social media use and depression symptoms differed substantially from individual to individual in both strength and kind. In addition, PSMU and ASMU were very weakly to weakly associated with depression symptoms for most individuals. Future work should examine the differential impact that social media have on our well-being, and how their effects may differ depending on our demographic characteristics, personality traits, and usage patterns.",Micaela Rodriguez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-A5B-FF0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-A5B-FF0,2021-02-09,2021-02-12T00:43:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-esteem,False
132,Communicate Hope to Motivate Action Against Highly Infectious SARS-CoV-2 Variants,"The world is facing a race between controlling new and more infectious variants of coronavirus and implementing vaccinations: How can health authorities and governments most effectively communicate the need to engage more strongly in protective behavior to avoid a collapse of the healthcare system until vaccination programs are effective? In the first wave of the pandemic, citizens became engaged in `flattening the curve' via powerful visualizations. Here, we use epidemiological modelling to develop a new visual communication aid, `buying time with hope', which reflects the pandemic trade-offs currently facing governments, authorities and citizens. Using a population-based experiment conducted in United States (N = 3,022), we demonstrate that this hope-oriented visual communication aid, depicting the competing effects on the epidemic curve of (1) more infectious variants and (2) vaccinations, motivates public action and communicates more effectively than fear-oriented visual communication, focusing exclusively on the threat of the new variants. Finally, using cross-national representative surveys from eight countries (N = 3,995), we document the urgent need to motivate public action to halt the spread of the new, more infectious variants. These findings not only provide public health authorities globally with a validated blueprint for health communication in a critical period of the pandemic but also provide general psychological insights into the importance of hope as a health communication strategy.",Michael Bang Petersen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603B-E09-1F2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603B-E09-1F2,2021-02-09,2021-02-12T00:35:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; infectious variants; health communication; protective behavior; covid-19; public health,False
133,"Objectively measured digital technology use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation among young adults","Introduction Research indicates that stressors introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted mental health, particularly among young people.1 Time spent on digital technology (e.g., social media, smartphones) has also increased2 as schools, workplaces, and social gathering sites have closed, thus intensifying pre-pandemic concerns regarding the putative effects of digital technology use (DTU) on mental health. Indeed, recent academic and newspaper articles have both directly and indirectly asserted that increased DTU is a source of the heightened psychological distress observed during the pandemic.3–5 However, these claims are dubious for two primary reasons. First, these articles rely on self-report measures of DTU, which are inaccurate6 and prone to systematic bias.7 Second, since the pandemic has impacted both mental health and DTU for many, the observed association between the two may be attributable to a shared common cause, rather than causality. Thus, we investigated the longitudinal associations between objectively measured DTU and mental health while accounting for important COVID-19-related effects. Methods This study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh and followed Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines. In this four-wave panel study, participants were recruited from Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/), an online participant-recruitment platform. Waves of data collection were launched on August 14, September 12, October 14, and November 9 of 2020. Eligible participants were U.S. residents, 18-35 years old, iPhone users, and had ≥ 10 previous submissions on Prolific with approval rating ≥95%. At each wave, participants uploaded screenshots of their “Screen Time” application (which passively tracks device usage) and completed self-reports of mental health (depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation [SI]), COVID-19-related stressors, and perceived COVID-19-related impact on well-being and DTU (Table 1). We extracted three elements from the “Screen Time” screenshots: (1) total screen time, (2) total time spent on social media, and (3) total number of pickups. We estimated separate random-intercept multilevel models for each mental health outcome using Mplus. Predictors were entered hierarchically in blocks (see eTable 3 in Supplement) to assess ΔR2 at the within- and between-person levels. See Supplement for methodological details. Results A total of 384 young adults participated in this study (Mage = 24.5, SDage = 5.1; 57% female; 54% white; 48% Bachelor’s degree education or above). Overall, participants averaged 47.5 hours of Screen Time, 677 pickups, and 15.5 hours of social media over the past week. On average, participants reported experiencing between 4 and 5 pandemic-related stressors per wave. Mean depression and anxiety t-scores were 54.6 and 56.7, respectively, and nearly 29% of participants reported past-week SI at least once. See eTable 1 for summary statistics of sample demographics and primary variables. Results of the multilevel analyses revealed that objectively-measured total screen time and social media use were unrelated to within- or between-person differences in mental health, while between-person difference in pickups was negatively associated with depression (see Figure 1). Together, the objective DTU variables explained, at most, 2.8% of the within- or between-person variance in any of the mental health outcomes (eTable 3 in Supplement). COVID-related impacts on well-being had the largest effects across models—accounting for about 45% and 10%, respectively, of the between- and within-person variance in depression and anxiety, and 21%/28% of the between/within variance in SI. Discussion Among a sample of young adults, a population with particularly high rates of DTU8 and COVID-19-related distress,1 we found that objectively-measured DTU did not contribute to increases in depression, anxiety, or SI—refuting the popular notion that increases in DTU may be contributing to young peoples’ psychological distress during the pandemic. Rather, depression, anxiety, and SI were driven mostly by young peoples’ reports of the pandemic’s impact on their well-being. The convenience-based sample, retrospective (past week) assessments of mental health outcomes, and single-item measures of COVID-19-related impacts are limitations of the study. Nevertheless, results indicate that current speculations about the direct harms of DTU on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related stressors.",Craig Sewall,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-A44-729,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-A44-729,2021-02-11,2021-02-11T23:39:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; social media; young adults; suicidal ideation; well-being; digital technology; depression; anxiety; covid-19,False
134,The effect of change in routine on student mental wellbeing during a nationwide lockdown,"Objective: There is limited existing research on the structure of routine and mental wellbeing. During March 2020, the UK entered a national lockdown, causing a sudden change in undergraduate students’ routines. This study uses this event to investigate the impact routine change had on students’ mental wellbeing; in particular looking at depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and eating behaviours. Method: Participants reported their daily routine timings (waking, breakfast, lunch, evening meal and bedtime) and activities (e.g. exercise amount, time with friends, time studying, etc) on a typical Monday, Wednesday and Saturday during term time and lockdown. Additionally they completed the PROMIS measures of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance, and the Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory. Results: Lockdown saw small but significant shifts in routine timing (on average 1.5 hours) However, there was no clear overall pattern of relationships between mental wellbeing and routine structure or magnitude of routine change. There was some evidence of changes in amount of exercise relating to reported anxiety. Discussion: These findings are consistent with the current literature reporting lockdown effects on behaviour. Routine timings shifted but this change was small and there was minimal impact of routine change on mental wellbeing reported by undergraduate students. The change in amount of exercise posed by lockdown did appear to be an important factor in wellbeing, and more research should focus on the wellbeing implications of closing places for exercise.",Jamie Thomas Kiltie et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622C-CB8-F9F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622C-CB8-F9F,2021-02-11,2021-02-11T21:26:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; lockdown; routine and structure; stability; covid-19 pandemic; mood; instability; eating behaviour,False
135,Decision making across adulthood during social distancing,"Covid-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals and increased monetary and health concerns for individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices individuals make about monetary, health, and social rewards, and if these unprecedented conditions would have a differential impact on older individuals. We conducted two racially diverse online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards; stated preferences for monetary, health, and social rewards; and social distancing behaviors. We used the initial study (N = 233) to test our hypotheses and we ran the second, pre-registered study (N = 243) to determine if these relationships replicated. Both studies recruited equal numbers of White/Caucasian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latinx participants. In both studies, we found that older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, despite the fact that there were no age differences in the stated importance of social and health rewards and no age differences in self-reported social distancing behaviors. These data further support the assertion that older adults have increased motivation for social and health rewards compared to younger individuals and that motivation is important to consider when examining decision making across the adult life span.",Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,2020-07-17,2021-02-11T21:11:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; reward value; reward domains; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; aging,False

We address this urgent policy issue using survey data collected from N = 6,576 high school students in a large, demographically diverse school district that allowed families to choose either format in fall 2020. Controlling for baseline measures of well-being collected one month before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as student demographics and other administrative data from official school records, students who attended school remotely reported lower levels of social, emotional, and academic well-being (ES = 0.10, 0.08, and 0.07 standard deviations, respectively) than classmates who attended school in person—differences that were consistent across gender, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status subgroups but significantly wider for older compared to younger students.",Angela Lee Duckworth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-21A-981,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-21A-981,2021-02-08,2021-02-11T15:07:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Situation; remote schooling; lockdown; mental health; covid-19; adolescents,False
137,Antenatal Depression and the Impact of COVID-19 Mitigation Efforts in Australia,"The mitigation efforts of COVID-19 have led to significant changes to the delivery of routine healthcare globally. In Australia, the way maternal health services have been delivered since the beginning of the pandemic has also changed. Maternity care and support are known to influence maternal mental health. One hundred and eighty-eight English speaking pregnant women residing in Australia were recruited using social media advertising between September and November 2020 as part of a larger study. Participants were aged between 19 and 42 (M = 31.05, SD = 4.68). Compared with previous Australian prevalence rates of around 7% for antenatal depression, rates in this study were 15.9% overall and 19% for those in Melbourne.

138,"Spring 2020 COVID-19 Surge: Prospective Relations between Psychosocial Factors and Guideline Adherence, Mask Wearing, and Symptoms in a U.S. Sample","Background: To date, much of the research on psychosocial correlates of coronavirus guideline adherence is cross-sectional, leaving prospective associations between these factors unaddressed. Additionally, investigations of prospective predictors of mask-wearing, COVID-19 symptoms, and viral testing remain wanting. Purpose: The present study examined prospective relations between psychosocial factors and guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptoms, and viral testing in a U.S. sample (N = 500) during the initial surge of COVID deaths in the U.S. between late March and early May, 2020. Methods: Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation framework, correlational analyses and path models tested associations among baseline personality traits, guideline adherence social cognitions, health beliefs, guideline adherence and follow-up guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptom counts, and 30-day viral testing. Results: Modeling results showed greater baseline agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were associated with more frequent baseline guideline adherence. More liberal political beliefs, greater guideline adherence intentions, and more frequent guideline adherence at baseline predicted more frequent mask-wearing at follow-up. Sex (female), lower perceived health, and greater neuroticism at baseline predicted greater symptom counts at follow-up. Reports of viral testing were quite low (1.80 %) yet were consistent with concurrent national reporting and limited availability of testing. Conclusions: Results show how inconsistencies and politization of health policy communication were concomitant with effects of individual-level political beliefs on mask-wearing during the initial surge. The results further clarify how personality traits related to social responsibility (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness) are associated with following new norms for prescribed behaviors and how symptom reporting can be as much a marker of perceived health as emotional stability.",Elizabeth Milad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46245-1F6-EF1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46245-1F6-EF1,2021-02-11,2021-02-11T03:07:36+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; health; mask-wearing; behavior; covid guidelines; viral testing; guidelines; personality; covid symptoms; adherence; coronavirus; u.s.; health behavior,False
139,How Relationship Satisfaction Influences Post-Pandemic COVID-19 Anxiety: A Four-Wave Study in China,"The social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic exerts lasing impacts on people’s mental health. However, whether and how people’s pre-existing positive social relationships can serve as stable reserves to alleviate people psychological distress following the disaster remains unknown. To address the question, the current study examined whether pre-pandemic relationship satisfaction would predict post-pandemic COVID-19 anxiety through middle-pandemic perceived social support and/or gratitude using four-wave data in China (N = 222, 54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17). Results showed that people’s COVID-19 anxiety decreased from the peak to the trough pandemic stage; perceived social support increased markedly from the pre-pandemic to the peak and remained stable afterwards, while relationship satisfaction remained unchanged throughout. Further, it was middle-pandemic perceived social support, but not gratitude, mediated the association between pre-pandemic relationship satisfaction and post-pandemic COVID-19 anxiety, indicating perceived social support played a more crucial role than gratitude in this process. Last, it is suggested to distinguish perceived social support from gratitude as two different components of social interactions.",Jingyi Ou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604B-1D6-40D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604B-1D6-40D,2021-02-09,2021-02-10T22:27:24+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; relationship satisfaction; covid-19 anxiety; gratitude; perceived social support; longitudinal,False
140,Investigating factors that affect the adoption of Covid-19 contact-tracing apps. A privacy calculus perspective,"On June 16th, the German government issued a Covid-19 contact-tracing app whose privacy settings were fiercely debated in advance. Contrary, potential benefits regarding the acceleration of contact-tracing were advertised. This study aimed to investigate the relative importance of privacy concerns and perceived benefits in relation to the decision to use the app adopting a privacy calculus perspective extended by trust in the app-designers and technological knowledge about the app. Results of a representative German sample (N = 952) revealed that app-users had less privacy concerns, perceived more usage benefits, had more trust and more knowledge about the app than non-adopters. Additionally, a path model revealed that perceiving benefits of the app was more important than having privacy concerns. Trust can help to overcome privacy concerns and to boost benefit perception.

141,Infection threat shapes our social instincts,"We social animals must balance the need to avoid infections with the need to interact with conspecifics. To that end we have evolved, alongside our physiological immune system, a suite of behaviors devised to deal with potentially contagious individuals. Focusing mostly on humans, the current review describes the design and biological innards of this behavioral immune system, laying out how infection threat shapes sociality and sociality shapes infection threat. The paper shows how the danger of contagion is detected and posted to the brain; how it affects individuals’ mate choice and sex life; why it strengthens ties within groups but severs those between them, leading to hostility toward anyone who looks, smells, or behaves unusually; and how it permeates the foundation of our moral and political views. This system was already in place when agriculture and animal domestication set off a massive increase in our population density, personal connections, and interaction with other species, amplifying enormously the spread of disease. Alas, pandemics such as COVID-19 not only are a disaster for public health, but, by rousing millions of behavioral immune systems, could prove a threat to harmonious cohabitation too.",Peter Kramer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FA-224-202,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FA-224-202,2021-02-02,2021-02-10T14:20:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Learning and Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology; public health; infectious disease; ingroup/outgroup; oxytocin; behavioral immune system; disgust,False
142,Mental Health and Wellbeing Implications of the COVID-19 Quarantine for Disabled and Disadvantaged Children and Young People: Evidence from a Cross-cultural Study in Zambia and Sierra Leone,"Background The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantining on children and young people (CYP) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yet to be fully comprehended. CYP in LMICs are at utmost risk, given the COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures, resulting in reduced access to school-based services for nutritional and mental health needs. This study examined mental health of CYP during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Zambia and Sierra Leone. Method In this cross-sectional study which conducted from 21st June to 8th August 2020, 468 disabled and disadvantaged CYP aged 12 to 25 completed a planning tool that comprised the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), as well as open-ended questions covering social connectedness, physical distancing and outdoor activities during the lockdown. The community coaches screened individuals and families who could be eligible to receive emergency aid, and based on a convenience sample following distribution of aid, recipients were invited to complete the online planning tool. The participants were vulnerable children and adolescents (e.g. disadvantaged or living with a disability) living in different provinces of Zambia and Sierra Leone. Results Mean (SD) SWEMWBS scores for all participants in Zambia and Sierra Leone, were 19.61 (3.45) and 21.65 (2.84), respectively. Mental wellbeing scores were lower in women, younger children and participants with two or more disabilities. Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. Conclusion The results show that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.",Darren Sharpe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619D-0F0-D9C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619D-0F0-D9C,2021-01-31,2021-02-09T20:42:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; sierra leone; zambia; disadvantaged; covid-19 pandemic; disabled; cross-cultural study; mental health; children and young people,False
143,Big Five traits as Predictors of Perceived Stressfulness of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study examined the Big Five personality traits as predictors of individual differences and changes in the perceived stressfulness of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany between early April 2020 and early September 2020. This timeframe includes the first national “lockdown,” the period of “easing” of restrictions, and the summer vacation period. Data were collected from n = 588 full-time employees, who provided baseline data on their personality traits in early December 2019, and then later provided data on perceived stressfulness of the COVID-19 pandemic at five time points, spanning six months. Consistent with expectations based on event and transition theories, results showed that, on average, perceived stressfulness declined between early April 2020 and early September 2020. Moreover, this effect was stronger between early April 2020 and early July 2020. Hypotheses based on the differential reactivity model of personality and stress were partially supported. Emotional stability was associated with lower, and extraversion associated with higher, average levels of perceived stressfulness. Finally, extraversion was associated with increases (i.e., positive trajectories) in perceived stressfulness between early April 2020 and early July 2020 and decreases (i.e., negative trajectories) in perceived stressfulness between early July 2020 and early September 2020.",Hannes Zacher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46223-FC3-927,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46223-FC3-927,2021-01-26,2021-02-09T14:25:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; pandemic; big five; covid-19; stressfulness,False

The role of personality, thinking styles and conspiracy mentality","Abstract The study aimed to investigate the role of personality, thinking styles, and conspiracy mentality in health-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., recommended health behaviors according to COVID-19 guidelines and engagement in pseudoscientific practices related to COVID-19. Basic personality space was defined by the HEXACO model complemented by Disintegration, which represents psychotic-like experiences and behaviors reconceptualized as a personality trait. Mediation analyses conducted on a convenient sample from the general population recruited via social media and by snowballing (N=417) showed that engagement in pseudoscientific behaviors was predicted by high Disintegration. However, this relationship was entirely mediated by high experiential and low rational thinking styles. Adherence to health practices recommended by COVID-19 guidelines was predicted by high Honesty traits, while low Disintegration had both direct and indirect effects through conspiracy mentality.",Ljiljana B.

145,Self-categorization and autism: Exploring the relationship between autistic traits and group homogeneity,"The Integrated Self-Categorization model of Autism (ISCA: Skorich & Haslam, under review; Bertschy et al., 2019) argues that the theory of mind differences seen in autism arise from Enhanced Perceptual Functioning/Weak Central Coherence, via a dysfunctional self-categorization mechanism. The ISCA model also makes the novel prediction that phenomena that arise from self-categorization should also be affected in autistic people. In this paper, we report three studies exploring this prediction in the context of one such phenomenon: group homogeneity. We first measure participants’ autistic traits, then ask them to make homogeneity judgments of their ingroup alone or their outgroup alone (in Study 1, and in the Alone conditions of Studies 2a and 2b); or of their ingroup in comparison to their outgroup or their outgroup in comparison to their ingroup (in the Compare conditions of Studies 2a and 2b). As predicted, we find that: the degree of autistic traits negatively predicts ratings of group homogeneity; this relationship is mediated by social identification/self-categorization; and typical comparison-related homogeneity effects are strengthened at higher relative to lower levels of autistic traits. These studies provide convergent evidence for the ISCA model and suggest important avenues for well-being and social skills interventions for autistic people.",Daniel Skorich et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-77E-8DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46230-77E-8DD,2021-02-07,2021-02-09T03:56:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Concepts and Categories; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intergroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; autism; weak central coherence; self-categorization; outgroup homogeneity; enhanced perceptual functioning,False
146,COVID-19 and Student Well-being: Stress and Mental Health during Return-to-School,"Students have been multiply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: threats to their own and their family’s health, the closure of schools, and pivoting to online learning in March 2020, a long summer of physical distancing, and then the challenge of returning to school in fall 2020. As damaging as the physical health effects of a global pandemic are, much has been speculated about the “second wave” of mental health crises, particularly for school-aged children and adolescents. Yet, few studies have asked students about their experiences during the pandemic. The present study engaged with over two thousand (N = 2,310; 1288 female; Mage = 14.5) 12-18-year-old Alberta students during their first few weeks of return-to-school in fall 2020. Students completed an online survey that asked about their perceptions of COVID-19, their fall return-to-school experiences (84.9% returned in-person), their self-reported pandemic-related stress, and their behaviour, affect, and cognitive functioning in the first few weeks of September. The majority of students (84.9%) returned to school in person. Students reported moderate and equal concern for their health, family confinement, and maintaining social contact. Student stress levels were also above critical thresholds for 25 percent of the sample, and females and older adolescents (age 15-18 years) generally reported higher stress indicators as compared to males and younger (age 12-14 years) adolescents. Multivariate analysis showed that stress indicators were positively and significantly correlated with self-reported behavioural concerns (i.e., conduct problems, negative affect, and cognitive/inattention), and that stress arousal (e.g., sleep problems, hypervigilance) accounted for significant variance in behavioural concerns. Results are discussed in the context of how schools can provide both universal responses to students during COVID-19 knowing that most students are coping well, while some may require more targeted strategies to address stress arousal and heightened negative affect.",Kelly Dean Schwartz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,2020-12-15,2021-02-08T18:33:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology,False
147,Predicting compliance with COVID-19 containing measures using context-specific and dispositional individual differences: The particular role of individual’s sense of responsibility for collective health,"In this research, we examined whether context-specific individual differences would allow for a better prediction of pandemic-related attitudes and behavior than non-specific dispositional traits. In Study 1, we introduced a context-specific measure of individual differences in the sense of responsibility for collective health (SRCH) and compared its ability to predict the acceptance of pandemic-related restrictions, with that of pandemic-related worries considered as a context-specific but self-oriented tendency and with two dispositional traits, i.e., grandiose and vulnerable narcissism. Only SRCH and pandemic-related worries uniquely predicted the acceptance of restrictions. In Study 2, we examined whether SRCH predicted increased hygiene and social distancing during pandemic better than narcissistic traits and pandemic worries, as well as social responsibility personal values—an others-oriented disposition. The results showed that SRCH explained most of the unique variance in social distancing, whereas pandemic-related worries uniquely predicted most of the variance in hygiene practices. Of the dispositional traits, only social responsibility personal values predicted a unique portion of the variance in social distancing, whereas narcissistic traits added no incremental value in predicting any of the precautionary measures. The results of both studies indicate that context-specific individual differences are robust predictors of compliance with COVID-19 mitigating measures.",Kinga Lachowicz-Tabaczek et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-5F3-D65,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-5F3-D65,2021-02-08,2021-02-08T15:45:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; narcissism; pandemic-related worry; hygiene; sense of responsibility for collective health; social distancing; acceptance of restrictions,False
148,Appreciation fosters Emotional Well-Being : The role of Sense of Coherence in this link,"Appreciation and sense of coherence have been widely researched for their links to well-being. however, the relevance of the concept with regard to the current state of happiness adds a unique perspective. In the present study, we investigate the role of appreciation towards emotional well-being in the context of the current pandemic (COVID-19), and whether the sense of coherence mediates this relationship. Participants (N= 234) were presented with measures of appreciation, sense of coherence and well-being. Our results indicate that appreciation leads to emotional wellbeing and sense of coherence mediated this relationship. Furthermore, we found positive correlations between all the three variables.

149,Supporting students during the transition to university in COVID-19: 5 key considerations and recommendations,"As COVID-19 continues to disrupt pre-tertiary education provision and examinations in the UK, urgent consideration must be given to how best to support the 2021-2022 cohort of incoming undergraduate students to Higher Education. In this paper, we draw upon the ‘Five Sense of Student Success’ model to highlight five key evidence-based considerations that Higher Education educators should be attentive to when preparing for the next academic year. These include: the challenge in helping students to reacclimatise to academic work following a period of prolonged educational disruption, supporting students to access the ‘hidden curriculum’ of Higher Education, negotiating mental health consequences of COVID-19, and remaining sensitive to inequalities of educational provision that students have experienced as a result of COVID-19. We provide evidence-based recommendations to each of these considerations.",Madeleine Pownall et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-FB0-825,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-FB0-825,2021-02-08,2021-02-08T15:41:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; student support; covid-19; transition to university; higher education,False
150,Ideology shapes trust in scientists and attitudes towards vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The paper investigates the influence of ideology on trust in scientists. We assume that during a pandemic, ideology is linked to levels of trust in scientists, such that those espousing left- (vs. right-) wing beliefs place more trust in the scientific profession. We posit that the negative perception of scientists, a feature of right-wing narratives in the country of study, underlies this effect. Additionally, we argue that ideology has an indirect impact, via levels of trust in scientists, on beliefs and attitudes towards vaccines and vaccine policy. To test these hypotheses, we conducted three studies (total N = 1155): one pre-pandemic study and two studies during a pandemic. The results confirm the hypotheses; however, we observed varied effects at the outset of the pandemic versus later stages. The findings contribute to the ongoing discussion around the ideological underpinnings of trust in scientists and carry implications for public health measures.",Małgorzata Kossowska et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603B-C87-EFB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603B-C87-EFB,2021-02-03,2021-02-08T14:24:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; political ideology; vaccine beliefs; perception of scientists; trust in scientists; vaccine hestitancy; covid-19,False
151,Factors influencing mental health among American youth in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objective: The article aims to show the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health of American youth. It also aims to identify factors that have an impact on the mental health maintenance of young Americans. The conducted analyses are an attempt at explaining the influence of high psycho-social stress on the mental health of young people. Methods: Secondary data from representative research conducted among the inhabitants of the United States of America on the sample of 10,139 respondents has been used in the analysis. Data is derived from the Pew Research Center, American Trends Panel. Results: The data analysis indicates that among all the age categories the highest levels of mental discomfort have been observed among the youngest Americans aged 18-29. The majority of respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The results of analyses of the youngest respondents (sample n=1083) have shown that there are a few factors which have impact on mental health of the young generation. Males, people living in relationships, practising religion more often, having a better financial situation, conservative beliefs and being devoid of citizenship had a better mental condition. Owned social, economic and cultural resources protect young Americans against the Covid-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The conducted research confirms the hypothesis that younger generations cope with the Covid-19 pandemic and related difficulties the worst. Due to the conducted analyses, the variables responsible for the deterioration of mental health in younger generations may be indicated.",Piotr Długosz,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-7A6-B6E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-7A6-B6E,2020-11-16,2021-02-08T14:21:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; anxiety; depression.; the united states of america; mental health; keywords: covid-19; youth,False
152,Information Delivered by a Chatbot Has a Positive Impact on COVID-19 Vaccines Attitudes and Intentions,"The COVID-19 vaccines will not end the pandemic if they stay in freezers. In many countries, such as France, COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy is high. It is crucial that governments make it as easy as possible for people who want to be vaccinated to do so, but also that they devise communication strategies to address the concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals. We introduce and test on 701 French participants a novel messaging strategy: a chatbot that answers people’s questions about COVID-19 vaccines. We find that interacting with this chatbot for a few minutes significantly increases people’s intentions to get vaccinated (ß = 0.12) and has a positive impact on their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination (ß = 0.23). Our results suggest that a properly scripted and regularly updated chatbot could offer a powerful resource to help fight hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines.",Sacha Altay et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B8-83D-909,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B8-83D-909,2021-01-04,2021-02-08T09:20:32+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; attitude change; covid-19 vaccines; covid-19; vaccination; chatbot; vaccine refusal",False
153,Information Dissemination and the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Relationship between Different Information Sources and Symptoms of Psychopathology,"The 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic has added to the mental health strain on individuals and groups across the world. Viral mitigation protocols and viral spread affect millions every day, but to widely different degrees. How individuals gather information about the pandemic might have an effect on levels of mental distress in the population. In this cross-sectional and representative study of the adult population of Norway, findings suggest that information gathered through newspapers and social media are the information pathways with the strongest association to symptoms of anxiety, depression and health anxiety with small to medium effect sizes. However, avoiding information about the pandemic had larger effect sizes related to symptoms of psychopathology than acquiring information about the pandemic from any source. The results suggest that to reach those who avoid pandemic news is an important goal, both to ensure the population as a whole gets relevant information regarding current viral mitigation protocols, that may in turn alleviate stress, and thus reduce the likelihood of viral transmission. The spread of pandemic misinformation on social media and the internet must be buffered, and successful interventions against misinformation may affect the mental health of the population.",Ole Myklebust Amundsen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46047-375-DB9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46047-375-DB9,2021-02-07,2021-02-08T09:03:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Impression Formation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; psychopathology; information sources; avoidance; covid-19,False
154,Underweighting of rare events in social interactions and its implications to the design of voluntary health applications,"Research on small decisions from experience suggests that people often behave as if they underweight rare events and choose the options that are frequently better. In a pandemic, this tendency implies complacency and reckless behavior. Furthermore, behavioral contagion exacerbates this problem. In two pre-registered experiments (Ntotal = 312), we validate these predictions and highlight a potential solution. Groups of participants played a repeated social game in one of two versions. In the basic version, people clearly preferred the dangerous reckless behavior that was better most of the time over the safer responsible behavior. In the augmented version, we gave participants an additional alternative abstracting the use of an application that frequently saves time but can sometimes have high costs. This alternative was stochastically dominated by the option abstracting the responsible choice and was thus normatively “irrelevant” to the decision participants made. Nevertheless, most people chose the new (“irrelevant”) alternative, providing the first clear demonstration of underweighting of rare events in fully described social games. We discuss public policies that can make the responsible use of health applications better most of the time, thus helping them get traction despite being voluntary. In one field demonstration of this idea amid the COVID-19 pandemic, usage rates of a contact tracing application among nursing home employees more than tripled when using the app also started saving them little time on a daily basis, and the high usage rates sustained over at least four weeks.",Ori Plonsky et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-4EE-84F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-4EE-84F,2020-11-18,2021-02-08T06:57:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; behavioral game theory; decisions from experience; covid-19,False
155,Mask-wearing and social distancing: Evidence from a video-observational and natural-experimental study of public space behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Face masks have been widely employed as a personal protective measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, concerns remain that masks create a false sense of security that reduces adherence to other public health measures, including social distancing. Purpose: This paper tested whether mask-wearing was negatively associated with social distancing compliance. Methods: In two studies, we combined video-observational records of public mask-wearing in two Dutch cities with a natural-experimental approach to evaluate the effect of an area-based mask mandate. Results: We found no observational evidence of an association between mask-wearing and social distancing (Study 1: p = .398; Study 2: p = .511), but found a positive link between crowding and social distancing violations (Study 1: p < .001; Study 2: p < .001). Our natural-experimental analysis showed that an area-based mask mandate did not significantly affect social distancing or crowding levels (Study 2: p = .781 and p = .126, respectively). Conclusions: Our results alleviate the concern that mask use reduces social distancing compliance or increases crowding levels. On the other hand, crowding reduction may be a viable strategy to mitigate social distancing violations.",Lasse Suonperä Liebst et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606D-869-5BF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606D-869-5BF,2021-02-05,2021-02-08T02:00:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
156,University Students’ Adherence to the COVID-19-guidelines: A Qualitative Study on Facilitators and Barriers,"Objective. This study aims to explore students’ adherence and reasons behind the (non)adherence to the COVID-19-regulations within a university setting. Methods. A total of 33 students participated in on-site and online focus group interviews (k=8). Discussed topics included the general COVID-19-guidelines of the university, including keeping ≥1.5 m distance, staying at home and getting tested when having symptoms, and wearing facemasks. Additionally, education and psychosocial wellbeing in the times of COVID-19 were discussed. We also conducted online interviews with stewards (2 focus group interviews and 1 individual interview) and security/crowd control officials (1 focus group interview) to learn more about students’ (non)adherence behaviors. Results. The findings of this study show that the interviewed students were willing to adhere to the guidelines within the university buildings. They mentioned several facilitators (e.g., the infrastructure of the buildings and staff) and barriers (e.g., being together with friends and difficulties with telling others to follow the regulations) for their compliance behaviors. Some students also stated that they are not afraid of COVID-19 because they are young, while others adhered to the regulations to protect vulnerable people. Conclusion. To create a safe environment within the university and alleviate the spread of the virus, future interventions require targeting the determinants of students’ non-adherence behaviors, such as lower risk perception (e.g., being young and no perceived threat/low vulnerability) and lower self-efficacy (e.g., for keeping distance, to determine symptoms for testing/isolating and to correct others).",Tugce Varol et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-768-FDE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-768-FDE,2021-02-05,2021-02-08T01:54:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; students; guidelines; covid-19; beliefs; behavior change; adherence,False
157,Children’s Vulnerability to Sexual Violence during COVID-19 in Kenya: Recommendations for the Future,"This article discusses the latest research that reveals that children seem to be facing new risks of sexual violence in Kenya during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patterns of sex offending against children coinciding with the implementation of lockdowns, curfews, and school closures may be shifting since the pandemic began. In particular, emerging evidence from Kenya suggests that child victims are younger, more likely to be victimized by a neighbor in a private residence, and in the daytime, compared to pre-pandemic. We conclude that situational crime prevention strategies that focus on providing alternative safe venues to reduce offending opportunities must be a central part of a public health approach to reduce children’s vulnerability during crises such as COVID-19.",Laura Stevens et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46241-648-9E4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46241-648-9E4,2021-02-05,2021-02-08T01:43:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Forensic; kenya; covid-19; public health approach; versatility; sexual violence; situational crime prevention,False

Further, replication tests with two new, independent data sources for regional Italian IQ, now including either 19 or all the 20 regions of Italy, show that these are similarly positively correlated with suicide rates.

159,The Masked Majority: Underprediction Of Widespread Support For Covid-19 Safety Policies.,"The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic in the US required organizations to make their own decisions regarding prevention policies, such as whether to require and enforce mask wearing, in the absence of regulations and norms. In five pre-registered studies, we investigate whether people support strict COVID-19 prevention policies and whether that support is underestimated, across business types, types of policy cues (stated and viral videos), and types of policies (required mask-wearing and vaccination). We consistently find that people strongly favor organizations with strict policies, such that the risks of both losing customers and of negative consumer perceptions are higher for lax policies (e.g., recommended mask-wearing) than for strict policies (requiring and enforcing mask-wearing). Nevertheless, customers and managers alike underestimate public support for strict policies, with negative consequences for word-of-mouth behavior. The underappreciation of support for public health measures that we document can impede the establishment of norms and the adoption of strict policies, undermining efforts to combat public health crises such as COVID-19.",Oleg Urminsky et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46213-8C7-974,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46213-8C7-974,2021-02-05,2021-02-08T00:23:51+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; covid-19; vaccine; prediction; norms; policy; public health,False
160,An evaluation of dual systems theories of adolescent delinquency in a normative longitudinal cohort study of youth,"Purpose: Dual systems theories of adolescent risk-taking propose that the socioemotional and self-regulation systems develop at different rates, resulting in a peak in sensation-seeking in adolescence at a time when self-regulation abilities are not yet fully mature. This ‘developmental imbalance’ between bottom-up drives for reward and top-down control is proposed to create a period of vulnerability for high-risk behaviours such as delinquency, substance use, unprotected sex, and reckless driving. However, as recently noted by Meisel et al. (2019), almost no studies have tested this hypothesis directly owing to a lack of studies that have exploited longitudinal data to construct developmental measures of imbalance. Methods: In this study, we use data from the longitudinal z-proso study (n=1522) to test whether the presence of a developmental imbalance between sensation-seeking and self-regulation is associated with levels of engagement in delinquency across early adolescence to adulthood. Results: Using a latent class growth analysis of sensation-seeking, self-regulation and delinquency, we found that a model with 3-classes was optimal in the whole sample and male sub-sample, including one class characterised by a developmental imbalance and corresponding adolescent peak in delinquency. In females, we found no evidence for a class that could be described according to the trajectories hypothesised in dual systems theory. Conclusions: Results support the claim that a developmental imbalance may drive an adolescent increase in delinquency, but only for a small subgroup of individuals, particularly males.",Aja Louise Murray et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-D6A-A3D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-D6A-A3D,2021-02-04,2021-02-07T19:31:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence,False
161,Learning by insight as a potential strategy to improve memory encoding in older adults,"Several cognitive functions show a decline with advanced age, most prominently episodic memory. Problem-solving by insight represents a special associative form of problem-solving that has previously been shown to facilitate long-term memory formation. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that the encoding network involved in insight-based memory formation is largely hippocampus-independent. This may represent a potential advantage in older adults, as the hippocampus is one of the earliest brain structures to show age-related volume loss and functional impairment. Here, we investigated the potential beneficial effects of learning by insight in healthy older (60-79 years) compared to young adults (19-28 years). To this end, we compared later memory performance for verbal riddles encoded incidentally via insight-like induced sudden comprehension in both age groups. We employed a variant of the Compound Remote Associate Task (CRAT) for incidental encoding, during which participants were instructed to judge the solvability of items. In a 24-hour delayed surprise memory test, participants attempted to solve previously encountered items and additionally performed a recognition memory test. During this test, older adults correctly solved an equal proportion of new items compared to young adults and both age groups reported a similar frequency of Aha! experiences. While overall memory performance was better in young participants (higher proportion of correctly solved and correctly recognized old items), older participants exhibited a stronger beneficial effect of insight on later recognition memory for previously presented items. Our results thus show that learning via insight might constitute a promising approach to improve memory function in old age.",Jasmin M.

162,"The effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a school-based intervention to improve sleep and psychological wellbeing in adolescents.","Introduction: Adolescents are vulnerable to experiencing insufficient sleep which can increase the risk of developing insomnia, mental/physical health problems and mood regulation. School-based sleep improvement interventions (SBSII) have been developed utilising Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia techniques and found improvements in sleep knowledge and behaviour. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a school-based sleep improvement intervention (iSLEEP) for improving sleep and psychological wellbeing in adolescents. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was adopted. The participants (115, aged 12-15) were recruited from secondary schools in Scotland. iSLEEP comprised of three lessons, combining formal sleep education and CBT-I, and were delivered over three consecutive weeks. Baseline (1 week before lesson 1) and follow-up (1 week following lesson 3) assessments comprised of self-report questionnaires to measure change in sleep, depression, anxiety and stress. Two weeks following the final lesson, a convenience sample of 19 pupils (14 females) were recruited to participate in focus groups. Results: There were significant improvements in overall sleep and marginal differences between those who were categorised with ‘probable insomnia’ at baseline and likewise for ‘good sleepers’. There were no significant improvements in symptoms of depression, anxiety or stress. Two themes and two sub-themes were generated. Participants reported that iSLEEP was acceptable and improved their sleep. Conclusions: These findings indicate that iSLEEP is an effective, feasible and acceptable SBSII. Future research should aim to utilise a controlled design to further investigate the efficacy of iSLEEP.",Stephanie Mccrory et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-0BB-152,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-0BB-152,2021-02-03,2021-02-06T22:21:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention; school-based intervention; adolescent sleep,False
163,Examining changes in parent-reported child and adolescent mental health throughout the UK’s first COVID-19 national lockdown.,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed the lives of children and adolescents, forcing them into periods of prolonged social isolation and time away from school. Understanding the psychological consequences of the UK’s lockdown for children and adolescents, the associated risk factors, and how trajectories may vary for children and adolescents in different circumstances is essential so that the most vulnerable children and adolescents can be identified and appropriate support can be implemented. Methods Parents and carers (n = 2988) in the U.K. with children and adolescents aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child’s mental health. Growth curve analysis was used to examine the changes in conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms between the end of March/beginning of April and July using data from four monthly assessments. Additionally, growth mixture modelling identified mental health trajectories for conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention and emotional symptoms separately and subsequent regression models were used to estimate predictors of mental health trajectory membership. Results Overall levels of hyperactivity and conduct problems increased over time whereas emotional symptoms remained relatively stable, though declined somewhat between June and July. Change over time varied according to child age, the presence of siblings, and with Special Educational Needs (SEN)/ Neurodevelopmental Disorders (ND). Subsequent growth mixture modelling identified three, four and five trajectories for hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems and emotional symptoms, respectively. Though many children maintained “stable 3 low” symptoms, others experienced elevated symptoms by July. These children were more likely to have a parent/carer with higher levels of psychological distress, to have SEN/ND, or to be younger in age. Conclusions The findings support previous literature and highlight that certain risk factors were associated with poorer mental health trajectories for children and adolescents during the pandemic.",Jasmine Raw et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-08D-4C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-08D-4C1,2021-02-03,2021-02-06T22:18:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; adolescents; children; covid-19; mental health; lockdown; united kingdom,False
164,Public Support for Government Responses Against COVID-19 Across Western Democracies in 2020,"To halt the spread of COVID-19 governments have engaged in policies that are both economically costly and involve infringements of individual rights. In democratic countries, these policy responses have elicited significant debate but we know little about the extent to which the responses are supported or opposed by the broader public. This manuscript investigates how citizens across eight Western democracies evaluate the specific policies imposed by their governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. We rely on large-scale, longitudinal surveys that are reflective of the national populations (total N = 124,062). On this basis, we investigate how pandemic-specific and broader political attitudes correlate with support for government responses during a significant part of 2020, a period marked by pandemic restrictions in all the countries. We find medium to high levels of support for the government's responses in all eight countries. Beyond the regular voters of the government, support is driven by individuals high in interpersonal trust and self-assessed knowledge about COVID-19. This suggests that halting the spread of COVID-19 is viewed as a collective action problem and mobilizes support from those knowing how to act and trusting others to act similarly.",Frederik Juhl Jørgensen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B6-8EC-D47,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B6-8EC-D47,2020-08-15,2021-02-06T13:26:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; government evaluation; covid-19; politics; lockdown; threat; prosociality,False
165,A Little Shot of Humility: Intellectual Humility Predicts Vaccination Attitudes and Intention to Vaccinate Against COVID-19,"Vaccinations remain a critical, albeit surprisingly controversial, health behavior, especially with the promise of widely available COVID-19 vaccine. Intellectual humility, a virtue characterized by nonjudgmental recognition of one’s own intellectual fallibility, may counter rigidity associated with anti-vaccination attitudes and help promote vaccine-related behaviors. This study investigated whether intellectual humility is related to anti-vaccination attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19, and whether intellectual humility can predict unique variance in these outcomes beyond participant demographic and personal factors. Participants (N = 351, 57.23% male, mean age = 37.41 years, SD = 11.51) completed a multi-dimensional measure for intellectual humility, the anti-vaccination attitudes (VAX) scale, and a two-item COVID-19 vaccination intention scale. Bivariate correlations demonstrated that intellectual humility was negatively related with anti-vaccination attitudes overall, r(349) = -.46, p < .001, and positively related to intentions to vaccinate against COVID-19, r(349) = .20, p < .001. Hierarchical multiple regression revealed that intellectual humility predicted all four types anti-vaccination attitudes, overall anti-vaccination attitudes, and COVID-19 vaccination intentions above and beyond demographic and personal factors (i.e., sex, race/ethnicity, age, education, socioeconomic status, and political orientation), R2 between .08 - .18, ps < .001.

166,Ecological and convergent validity of experimentally and dynamically assessed social capacity using the Perceptual Crossing Experiment in adolescence,"The Perceptual Crossing Experiment (PCE) captures social capacity using real-time social interaction dynamics but has not been externally validated. We tested ecological and convergent validity of the PCE, in a sample of 208 adolescents from the general population, aged 11 to 19. We expected associations between PCE social capacity and 1) quantity and quality of social interaction in daily life, using Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) (ecological validity), and 2) self-reported social skills using a questionnaire (convergent validity). We also expected PCE social capacity to better explain variance in ESM social measures than self-reported social skills. Multilevel analyses showed that only self-reported social skills were significantly positively associated with social experience of company in daily life.

167,Encouraging the resumption of economic activity after COVID-19: Evidence from a large scale field experiment in China,"As the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end, governments find themselves facing a new challenge: motivating citizens to resume economic activity. What is an effective way to do so? We investigate this question using a field experiment in the city of Zhengzhou, China immediately following the end of the city's COVID-19 lockdown. Using self-reports and GPS trajectory data from participants' phones, we assessed the effect of providing information about the proportion of participants' neighbors who have resumed economic activity. We find that informing individuals about their neighbors' plans to visit restaurants increases the fraction of participants visiting restaurants by 12 percentage points (37%), amongst those participants who underestimated the proportion of neighbors who resumed economic activity. Those who overestimated did not respond by reducing restaurant attendance, so the intervention yielded no `boomerang' effect. We explore moderators, risk perceptions, and a placebo intervention for parks. All of these analyses suggest our intervention worked by reducing the perceived risk of going to restaurants.",Juan Palacios et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46031-DE4-DE2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46031-DE4-DE2,2021-02-03,2021-02-06T12:03:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Behavioral Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Experimental Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; consumer city; descriptive norms; covid-19; voluntary economic resumption; field experiment; policy,False
168,The Benefits of Living with Close Others: A Longitudinal Examination of Mental Health Before and During a Global Stressor,"For better or worse, the people we live with may exert a powerful influence on our mental health, perhaps especially during times of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic—a large-scale stressor that prompted health recommendations to stay home to reduce disease spread—provided a unique opportunity to examine how the people we share our homes with may shape our mental health. A seven-wave longitudinal study assessed mental health month-to-month before and during the pandemic (February through September, 2020) in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N=656; N=544). Pre-registered analyses demonstrated that people living with close others (children and/or romantic partners) experienced better well-being, before and during the pandemic’s first six months. These groups also experienced unique increases in ill-being during the pandemic’s onset, but parents’ ill-being also recovered more quickly. These findings highlight the crucial protective function of close relationships for mental health both generally and amidst a pandemic.",Natalie M.

169,Parenting in a Pandemic: Parental Stress During the Physical Distancing Intervention Following the onset of the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective: The main aim of the study was to examine levels of parental stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general parental population (N = 2868) during the strict government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further investigated specific predictors of parental distress, including burnout, anger aimed at children, worry, lack of social support, lower perceived self-efficacy, and difficulty to work from home. Method: In this cross-sectional, epidemiological study, we disseminate an online survey that was administered two weeks after the government-initiated physical distancing protocols were established. Data were collected from March 31 to April 7. Results: Female parents compared to male parents and parents living with more than one child per parent or child(ren) with special needs compared to those living with one or fewer children per parent reported higher levels of parental stress. Burnout and social support were further associated with parental stress. Specifically, nearly one-fourth of the parents reported that they have felt burned out or in the proximity of feeling burned out more than half the days during the social distancing interventions. Also, 29% of the parents reported that they were angrier at their child(ren) than usual during the physical distancing period. Parents with a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis had significantly higher parental stress compared to individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms above standardized cutoff levels among the 2868 parents was 25.4% for depression and 24.1% for anxiety, with the highest prevalence score on both symptoms of anxiety (37.6%) and depression (38.5%) for the youngest parents (age group 21–30 years). Furthermore, the parents who were home with their children and predominantly followed distancing protocol by socially distancing from public activity and peers (i.e., at least 10 out of 14 days) had significantly higher symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (27%), compared to parents who did not isolate in the same manner (i.e., depression 13% and anxiety 15%). Conclusions: The present study reveals that home confinement during the restricted lockdown period is related to markedly high levels of parental stress, in addition to symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents. Given the detrimental effects of depression, anxiety, and parental stress on the quality of life, morbidity rates, as well as adverse child outcomes and the potential risk of child abuse and neglect, these results suggest that appropriate action should be taken to impede further development of these symptoms, as well as developing interventions aimed at vulnerable subgroups and other relevant factors associated with increased parental stress.

170,Is Commitment Getting Infected Too? How COVID-19 Stay-Home Orders Influence Workgroup Commitment,"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated “Stay-Home” restrictions in the United States have disrupted employees’ lives. We leverage the change brought on by the Stay-Home restrictions to examine corresponding changes in employees’ commitment to their workgroup. Specifically, we advance and test a model predicting that the Stay-Home restrictions prevented workgroups from engaging in rigidly performed, meaningful workplace activities (i.e., ritualistic workplace activities), which subsequently made members feel that the group was less cohesive and ultimately reduced members’ workgroup commitment. We also compare changes in workgroup commitment to changes in workgroup identification, hypothesizing that commitment to one’s group erodes more than identification when workgroups are perceived to be less cohesive. We test our model in a four-wave panel survey of 772 U.S. employees at the onset of the Stay-Home restrictions, which allows us to examine within-person changes to commitment over time. Consistent with our hypotheses, commitment decreased as the duration of Stay-Home restrictions increased, which was mediated by corresponding declines in engaging in ritualistic workplace activities and perceptions of the workgroup’s cohesiveness. Further, commitment to one’s workgroup declined more than did identification with the workgroup, due to the stronger relationship between perceived group cohesion and commitment (vs. identification). We replicated these results in a separate, preregistered cross-sectional survey. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms underlying workgroup commitment, demonstrating that engagement in ritualistic activities, which enhance workgroup cohesion, is linked to stronger commitment— more so than identification—over time.",Daniel Stein et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46073-692-665,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46073-692-665,2021-02-04,2021-02-04T22:16:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; ritual; commitment; coronavirus; identification; covid-19; psychology; organizational behavior,False
171,Storm Clouds and Silver Linings: Impacts of COVID-19 and Daily Emotional Health in Adolescent Girls,"Objective: Changes to daily life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to contribute to adolescent girls’ emotional health in both positive and negative ways, but the effects of these profound changes on adolescent daily functioning are unknown. Method: We conducted a 10-day daily diary study in a sample of 93 U.S. adolescent girls (aged 12-17) enriched for temperamental risk for anxiety and depression. The study was conducted in April/May 2020 when all participants were under state-issued stay-at-home orders. Girls provided daily reports of positive and negative affect, depressive and anxious symptoms, activities, and positive and negative impacts resulting from the pandemic. Results: Girls reported engaging in many activities that may contribute to well-being. Positive impacts associated with improved same-day emotional health included spending more time with family, more time to relax, and reduced pressure from school and activities. Negative impacts associated with poorer same-day emotional health included problems with online schooling, lack of space/privacy, lack of a regular schedule, and family conflict. Conclusion: Findings suggest that, when safe and feasible, families and communities should prioritize in-person or quality online schooling, resources and space for learning, promoting daily routines, and spending time with their teens while reducing conflict. The COVID-19 pandemic also appears to have offered many adolescent girls a respite from the chronic stress associated with modern teen life, with time to relax and engage in creative and healthy pursuits showing benefits for daily emotional health, which should be considered following the return to normal life.",Jennifer Susan Silk et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614B-ADE-C32,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614B-ADE-C32,2021-02-02,2021-02-04T21:52:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; daily diary; emotion; anxiety; depression; adolescent; covid-19,False
172,How did the mental health of children and adolescents change during early lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK?,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruption to the lives of children and young people. Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors, is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the UK in response to the pandemic. Methods UK-based parents and carers (n = 2,673) of school-aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child’s mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among pre-adolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders, exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of lockdown on children and young people’s adjustment.

173,High trait self-control and low boredom proneness help COVID-19 homeschoolers,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) schools around the world have been closed to protect against the spread of coronavirus. In several countries, homeschooling has been introduced to replace classroom schooling. With a focus on individual differences, the present study examined 138 schoolers (age range = 6 to 21 years) regarding their self-control and boredom proneness. The results showed that both traits were important in predicting adherence to homeschooling. Schoolers with higher levels of self-control perceived homeschooling as less difficult, which in turn increased homeschooling adherence. In contrast, schoolers with higher levels of boredom proneness perceived homeschooling as more difficult, which in turn reduced homeschooling adherence. These results partially hold when it comes to studying in the classroom. However, boredom threatened adherence only in the homeschooling context. Our results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical construct to consider when educational systems switch to homeschooling during a pandemic.",Corinna Martarelli et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A2-A1B-F9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A2-A1B-F9D,2020-08-12,2021-02-03T07:36:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology,False
174,"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9).

175,How the Affective Quality of Social Connections May Contribute to Public Health: Prosocial Tendencies Account for the Links Between Positivity Resonance and Behaviors that Reduce the Spread of COVID-19,"Although behaviors such as handwashing, mask wearing and social distancing are known to limit viral spread, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals in the United States did not adopt them. The Positivity Resonance Theory of co-experienced positive affect (Fredrickson, 2016) holds that shared pleasant states that include the key features of mutual care and a sense of oneness through behavioral synchrony, function to build prosocial tendencies (e.g., self-transcendent and other-oriented dispositions of felt unity, empathy, altruism and general positivity toward humanity). We tested the theory-driven hypothesis that prosocial tendencies are associated with high-quality social connections characterized by the affective state of positivity resonance, and in turn account for behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. We measured perceived positivity resonance at the level of social episodes either during the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 1, N = 1059, April-May 2020) or before it (Study 2, N = 227, March-November 2019). In both studies, cross-sectionally and prospectively, results suggest that perceived positivity resonance had a positive indirect effect on self-reported hygienic behaviors (e.g., handwashing & mask-wearing), which was mediated by a latent measure of prosocial tendencies. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these mediation effects to be independent of competing predictors of prosocial tendencies (e.g., overall positive and negative affect, frequency of social interaction) and competing predictors of health behaviors (e.g., political orientation, high-risk status, illness symptoms). Effects for social distancing were mixed. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that positivity resonance builds self-transcendent prosocial tendencies that motivate behaviors to protect community health.",Taylor Nicole West et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-9A6-321,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-9A6-321,2020-08-19,2021-02-02T15:43:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; emotion; broaden-and-build; affective science; social connection; prosocial; health behavior; covid-19; positive psychology,False

177,Identification of relevant socio-cognitive determinants explaining multiple parental sun protection behaviors,"Background: Adequate sun safety during childhood is crucial for decreasing skin cancer risk in later life. Although parents are an essential target group in applying sun protection measures for their children, insight into the determinants associated with their sun protection behaviors is limited. Aims: This study aims to identify most relevant determinants in predicting multiple parental sun protection intentions and behaviors in different sun exposure situations. Methods: A longitudinal survey study with two measurements was conducted among Dutch parents (N=670) of children (4-12 years old). Twenty-seven socio-cognitive determinants were examined in terms of relevance regarding four parental sun protection behaviors in different sun exposure situations. The CIBER approach was used to visualize room for improvement (sample means) on all determinants and their association strengths (correlations) with sun protection intentions and behaviors. Results: Behavior-specific rather than generic determinants were most relevant in explaining all sun protection behaviors. Of these determinants, attitude, self-efficacy and action planning, and especially parental feelings of difficulty in performing sun protection behaviors, were most relevant. Altogether, the explained variance of all socio-cognitive determinants was highest for shade-seeking behavior (R2= .41 and .43) and lowest for supportive behavior (R2=.19 and .29) in both planned and incidental sun exposure situations respectively. Discussion: This study provides detailed insight into relevant socio-cognitive determinants of parental sun protection behaviors in various sun exposure situations and directions for composing parental skin cancer prevention interventions.

178,"A qualitative exploration of parental perceptions regarding children’s sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn","Sun protection among children is of utmost importance since sunburn in early life is a major risk factor for skin cancer development. Because parents play a vital role in enhancing sun safety among children, this study explored parental perceptions concerning sun exposure, sun protection behaviors, and sunburn in children. Additionally, the context in which children experience sunburn in order to assist the development, optimization, and targeting of sun safety interventions for parents is revealed. A qualitative study design, using a semi-structured interview guide addressing several themes (e.g. sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn experiences), was used. Data were collected in the Netherlands in the fall of 2019. Parents were recruited via purposive sampling at schools, youth services centers, and social media. Execution, transcription, and coding of the interviews was done by two researchers, using the qualitative analyzing program Nvivo (interrater reliability of d =.84). In total, 26 interviews were performed (n=17 mothers, n=17 daughters, aged between 4 -11 years). Parental perceptions and recall of their child’s lifetime sunburn were frequent, even though all parents reported using at least one sun protection measure during sun exposure situations and parents seemed often unaware of their child’s sunburn. Moreover, parents reported an overreliance on sunscreen, often failing to adequately protect their children’s skin. Water-related activities, a lack of shade, and misconceptions regarding UV-index were often related to sunburn. In addition, unexpected sun exposure or longer exposure duration than initially planned were reported as challenging situations. The majority of parents had positive perceptions regarding tanned skin for both themselves as for children. This study provides directions for skin cancer prevention efforts targeted at both parents and their children. Since a lack of knowledge regarding sufficient sun protection measures and sunburn occurrence in various situations was reported, educational efforts are warranted. Additionally, focusing on clothing, shade-seeking, and adequate sunscreen use is recommended to increase children’s sun safety. By intervening in the physical environment as well (e.g. providing shady areas), sun protection barriers can be reduced. Lastly, the general positive attitude towards tanned skin evident in this study is certainly worthy of attention in future interventions.",Karlijn Thoonen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-0F7-ABA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-0F7-ABA,2020-08-18,2021-02-01T16:06:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; parenting; health promotion; sunburn; tanned skin; sun protection behavior; children's health; skin cancer prevention,False

180,Perceived stress as mediator for longitudinal effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on wellbeing of parents and children,"Dealing with COVID-19 lockdown may have negative effects on children, but at the same time might facilitate parent-child bonding. Perceived stress may influence the direction of these effects. Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents and children. A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-old) filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental negative feelings (anxiety, depression, hostility and interpersonal sensitivity). Longitudinal child measures showed a gradual decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in parental negative feelings and children’s externalizing behavior were mediated by perceived stress: higher scores prior to the lockdown were related to more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in parental negative feelings and children’s’ externalizing behavior. Perceived stress in parents and children was associated with negative coping strategies. Additionally, children’s stress levels were influenced by prior and current parental overreactivity. These results suggest that children in families with negative coping strategies and (a history of) parental overreactivity might be at risk for negative consequences of the lockdown.",Michelle Achterberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,2020-09-28,2021-02-01T09:05:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Gene-environment Interaction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; wellbeing; resilience; covid-19; externalizing behavior; twin study; psychological symptoms; internalizing behavior; risk factors; lockdown; parental reactivity; perceived stress; development,False
181,Association of COVID19-induced Anosmia and Ageusia with Depression and Suicidal Ideation,"Background. Clinical reports from patients suffering from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) reflect a high prevalence of sensory deprivation or loss pertaining to smell (dysosmia/anosmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia/ageusia). Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. Methods. A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. Results. Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. Limitations. Use of self-diagnosed disease as well as a broad array of anosmia/ageusia-related terminology may entail both information bias and overestimates of symptom incidence. Conclusions. The specific effects of COVID-19 on the senses may have long-term implications for patient mental health well-being beyond the primary recovery period.

182,“It is the only constant in what feels like a completely upside down and scary world”: Living with an Eating Disorder during COVID-19 and the importance of perceived control for recovery and relapse.,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound, negative impact on the lives and wellbeing of the population, and it can raise additional challenges for individuals with eating disorders. During early stages of the UK lockdown, individuals reported disruptions to many aspects of their lives, including reduced feelings of control and serious concerns over the impact of the pandemic on eating disorder symptoms and/or recovery. This study compares data from two time points to explore the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on this population. Method: A mixed-methods online survey was developed for the purpose of this study. Data was collected at the two key time points: First, soon after the start of the first UK lockdown (April 2020) and second, as the first lockdown restrictions began to be lifted (June 2020). The sample consisted of 58 individuals currently experiencing, or in recovery from, an eating disorder. Participants were aged between 16-65 years; 57 identified as female, and 1 male. Results: Higher perceptions of general, external control were associated with recovery between the time points. Individuals who experienced less perceived control reported a tendency to rely upon eating disorder behaviours as an auxiliary coping mechanism, i.e., diminished external control was directed inwards and replaced with controlling their own behaviour. Conclusions: Perceived control is a significant factor in eating disorder recovery. As a result of the pandemic’s negative impact upon peoples’ sense of control, individuals with eating disorders are at significant risk of detrimental impacts on their recovery and wellbeing. The results have implications for future treatments based on strengthening individuals’ perceptions of control to promote recovery.",Dawn Branley-Bell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46161-1A0-A59,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46161-1A0-A59,2021-01-29,2021-01-31T17:01:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; perceived control; relapse; bulimia; pandemic; control; recovery; anorexia; healthcare; covid-19; health; eating disorders; covid; treatment,False
183,"Individual Differences in Social Distancing and Mask-Wearing in the Pandemic of COVID-19: The Role of Need for Cognition, Self-control, and Risk Attitude","In the United States, while the number of COVID-19 cases continue to increase, the practice of social distancing and mask-wearing have been controversial and even politicized. The present study examined the role of psychological traits in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior and attitude. A sample of 233 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, mask-wearing behavior and attitude, need for cognition, self-control, risk attitude, and political ideology. Epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state participants resided in. As a result, epidemiological information did not correlate with protective behaviors. Political ideology, on the other hand, was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with greater engagement in social distancing compliance and mask-wearing behavior an attitude. Importantly, those who were more risk averse, or had a higher level of self-control or need for cognition practiced more social distancing and mask-wearing, after controlling for demographics, epidemiological information, and political ideology. For mask-wearing behavior, political ideology interacted with both need for cognition and self-control. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological roots of individual differences in social distancing and mask-wearing compliance.",Ping Xu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621C-078-521,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621C-078-521,2020-08-14,2021-01-31T03:26:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; mask wearing; need for cognition; social distancing; self-control; political orientation; covid-19; risk preference,False
184,Empathy predicts self-isolation behaviour acceptance during coronavirus risk exposure,"Health risk exposure during the global COVID-19 pandemic has required people to adopt self-isolation. Public authorities have therefore had the difficult task of sustaining such protective but stressful behaviour. Evidence shows that besides egoistic drives, the motivation for self-isolation behaviour could be altruistic. However, the type and role of prosocial motivation in the current pandemic is underestimated and its interaction with risk exposure and psychological distress is largely unknown. Here we show that empathic concern for the most vulnerable predicts acceptance of lockdown measures. In two retrospective studies, one with a general population and one with COVID-19 positive patients, we found that 1) along with health risk exposure, empathic concern is a predictor of acceptance of lockdown measures 2) social covariates and psychological distress have no significant impact. Our results support the need to focus on altruistic behaviours while informing the public instead of on fear-inducing messages.",Serena Petrocchi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-DBD-F3F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-DBD-F3F,2021-01-28,2021-01-30T11:42:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; empathy; human behaviour; lockdown; quarantine; public health; psychological distress; depression; cummunication; isolation; covid-19; prosocial behaviour; anxiety,False
185,"Conspiratorial thinking during COVID-19: The roles of paranoia, delusion-proneness, and intolerance of uncertainty","The COVID-19 global pandemic has left many feeling a sense of profound uncertainty about their world, safety, and livelihood. Information that can help make sense of this uncertainty is offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individuals high in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be particularly impacted by the impoverished epistemic environment and may thus be more drawn to conspiratorial thinking (CT). In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty as well as anxiety, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia explained the relationship between IU and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. In contrast, anxiety did not explain the relationship between IU and CT, suggesting a stronger role of cognitive traits as opposed to affective factors. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in IU, delusion proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global crisis, in which CT is more prevalent and salient. Informational intervention designs may benefit from leveraging the body of work demonstrating the efficacy of targeting IU to incite meaningful changes in thinking.",Emmett M.

186,Development of Parent-Adolescent Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Stress and Coping,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the extensive measures to prevent spread of the virus have had a major impact on the daily life of families. Such changes in family routines might have an impact on the quality of parenting and the parent-adolescent relationship. However, not all families might be affected by the crisis to a similar extent. In particular, parents and adolescents who have high levels of COVID-19-related stress might experience reduced quality of parenting or parent-child relationships. Families who are able to cope actively might experience limited or even positive changes in relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal, multi-informant, and pre-registered study used data of 240 Dutch parents and adolescents (Mage 11.4 years). Using Latent Change Score models, we examined how parent-reported parenting and adolescent-reported relationship quality changed over a six month’s period, from the pre-COVID-19 to the COVID-19 period. Moreover, we examined the moderating role of parents’ and adolescents’ COVID-19-related stress, coping, and the interaction between stress and coping on relationship change. Results showed that on average both the amount of warmth and conflict in parent-adolescent relationships decreased. For positive parenting, there was a significant interaction effect of stress and coping, with active coping leading to a mitigated decline in the quality of parenting only in families who experienced low levels of COVID-19-related stress.",Monika H.

187,A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19,"Aim and Method: This perspective searches presents evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. Results: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.",Lilian Jans-Beken,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,2020-11-25,2021-01-29T07:49:29+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; clinical psychology; virtues; character strengths; corona; positive psychology",False

Method: Information regarding the Israeli population since mid-1948 was collected from records of the Israeli Ministry of Health and the Central Bureau of Statistics. The British Mandate Administration collected and registered statistical data regarding suicide since 1938. Therefore, data for the years 1919-1937 were estimated by the author. Results: The study discerns a picture of decreasing suicide rates, in particular for suicide rates among women. In addition, analysis of suicide rates by gender reveals an uneven distribution, where more men than women died by suicide. Conclusions: The noticeable changes in the suicide rates throughout the years were influenced by the countries of birth from which the immigrants came. Thus, compared with immigrants from Europe, those from Middle Eastern and North African Muslim countries have remarkedly reduced the overall rates in Israel.

Most studies report the impact on mental health and mental distress during the pandemic. As a result of various stressors (such as lockdown, quarantines, and misinformation) there is heightened fear of a pandemic. The sufferer may experience a variety of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. In predisposed vulnerable individuals, fear of COVID-19 is perpetuating pain and dysfunction. This study discussed the ABC framework of fear and influencer to better understand the different levels of symptoms and interventions. There is an urgent need to integrate mental health into primary health-care centers. The attending physician should be aware of the stress disorders associated with the pandemic.

190,Psychology Students’ Motivation and Learning in Response to the Shift to Remote Instruction During COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to dramatic shifts in the teaching and learning of psychology. The purpose of this study was to document the impact of those shifts on undergraduate psychology students’ motivation and self-regulation of learning during the initial transition to remote instruction. Psychology majors (N = 358) attending a public land-grant university in the southeastern U.S. voluntarily completed a survey at the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Closed- and open-ended items assessed students’ self-reported behavioral and psychological wellness, motivation, and learning experiences during the COVID-19 outbreak. A convergent mixed methods analysis was used in which open-ended questions provided context and experiential nuance to quantitative findings. Students reported increases in sleep, social media use, gaming, and procrastination, but decreases in academic motivation and self-regulation (e.g., focusing, juggling responsibilities). Over 75% reported increases in stress, which they attributed most frequently to motivational and academic challenges. Students reported learning less in most of their classes following the shift. They attributed this to internal factors, including self-regulatory/motivational difficulties, and external factors, such as instructional delivery modality. Although most perceived their instructors as understanding, nearly half reported a decline in instructional quality and communication after the shift to remote instruction. Over one third of students reported feeling less certain about their future educational plans.

In this study, participants completed online questionnaires assessing objective social isolation, loneliness, mental health, and virtual social interactions. There was clear evidence for lower well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adults characterized by large increases in depressive symptoms, and large decrements in happiness and social satisfaction post-pandemic onset. In line with expectations, a robust positive association was seen between household size (an index of objective social contact) and well-being. However, contrary to expectations, there was no association between the frequency of virtual social interactions and well-being.

Prosocial support directed to friends peaked in mid-adolescence, whereas prosocial support towards family members showed a gradual increase from childhood to young adulthood. Overall, adolescents gave more to COVID-19 targets than to peers and friends.

193,The ‘Zoom Effect’: Exploring the impact of video-calling on appearance dissatisfaction and interest in cosmetic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The popularity of videoconferencing platforms has skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, there have been concerns regarding the potential for video-calls to promote appearance dissatisfaction, as individuals are exposed to their reflection on camera for extended periods. The current study characterised current video-usage behaviours and their relationship with appearance dissatisfaction and interest in beauty procedures in the general population. An online survey was completed by 379 adults currently living in Australia. Multiple aspects of video usage were assessed, including engagement in ‘video-manipulation’ techniques to enhance appearance and the focus of visual attention while on video-calls (i.e. on self or others). The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire was administered to determine if video-use behaviours were associated with greater body image disturbance. Over one-third of participants had identified new appearance concerns while on video. Dysmorphic concern was associated with self-focused attention, video manipulation behaviours and increasing appearance concerns. Individuals who identified new video-based appearance concerns reported greater interest in obtaining future beauty and cosmetic procedures. This is the first study to report the potential risks of video-call usage on body image and appearance dissatisfaction.

Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity.

195,A Bayesian approach to reveal the key role of mask wearing in modulating interpersonal distance during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Creating and maintaining bonds in humans typically comes with interactions occurring at close social distances which are usually shorter than the one (of at least 1.5 meters) recommended as a relevant measure of COVID-19 contagion containment. In a web-based experimental study conducted during the first pandemic wave (mid-April 2020), we asked 242 participants to regulate their preferred distance towards confederates who did or did not wear protective mask/gloves and who could have tested positive or negative to COVID-19 or whose test results are unknown. Information concerning the dispositional factors (perceived vulnerability to disease, moral attitudes and prosocial tendencies) and situational factors (perceived severity of the situation in the country, frequency of physical and virtual social contacts and attitudes toward quarantine) that may modulate compliance with safety prescriptions was also acquired. A bayesian analysis approach was adopted. Individual differences did not modulate the interpersonal distance. We found strong evidence in favor of a reduction of interpersonal distance towards characters wearing protective equipment and who tested negative to Covid-19. Importantly, shorter interpersonal distances were kept towards confederates wearing protections, even when their test result was unknown or turned out positive to Covid-19. The protective equipment-related regulation of interpersonal distance may reflect an underestimation of the perceived vulnerability to the infection, which has to be discouraged when pursuing individual and collective safety.",Matteo P.

In August of 2020, we asked participants about changes in their friendships as a result of the pandemic - including changes in the quality of friendships and people’s feelings about their friends - as part of a larger longitudinal study. We found that people who are younger, male, and less educated reported more negative effects on their friendships as a result of the pandemic, including feeling lonelier and less satisfied with their friends, while people with higher subjective socioeconomic status (SES) wanted to make more and shallower friends than those with lower subjective SES. We also found that feelings of stress, isolation and guilt around friendship are associated with greater COVID-related social risk taking, such as being motivated to make new friends and visit friends in person. Males, who reported more negative effects of the pandemic on their friendship than females, also reported a greater likelihood than females that they would attend large parties.

199,Temporal Distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Letter Writing with Future Self can Mitigate Negative Affect,"Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading across the world, threatening not only physical health but also psychological well-being. We reasoned that a broadened temporal perspective may attenuate current mental distress and tested a letter-writing manipulation designed to connect people to their post-COVID-19 future selves. Participants were randomly assigned to either send a letter to their future self (letter-to-future), send a letter to present self from the perspective of future self (letter-from-future), or a control condition. Participants in both letter-writing conditions showed immediate decrease in negative affect and increase in positive affect relative to the control condition.

200,Assessment supervision during COVID-19 and beyond: Trainee perspectives on the supervision of teleassessment,"Due to COVID-19, there has been a rapid shift toward the remote administration of psychological assessments, or teleassessment. Guidelines have been published by the American Psychological Association regarding best practices for teleassessment administration, yet there is limited guidance for the clinical supervision of trainees. Quality supervision is a core competency of health service psychologists, and critical to the professional development of practitioners, as well as the protection of patients. This article reviews the extant literature on teleassessment and makes practice-informed recommendations to enhance the supervision of teleassessment administration. Implications for training in teleassessment during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the development of clinical training competencies in teleassessment are considered.",Zabin Salim Patel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616F-1EE-A35,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616F-1EE-A35,2021-01-24,2021-01-25T00:44:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; training; supervision; teleassessment; telehealth,False
201,A systematic review on sex- and gender-sensitive research in public mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis,"Background Sex and gender are important modifiers of mental health and behavior in normal times and during crises. We investigated whether they were addressed by empirical, international research which explored the mental health and health behavior ramifications after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We systematically searched the databases PsyArXiv, PubMed, PsycInfo, Psyndex, PubPsych, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies assessing mental health outcomes (main outcomes) as well as potential risk and protective health behavior (additional outcomes) up to July 2, 2020. Findings Most of the 80 publications fulfilling the selection criteria reflected the static difference perspective treating sex and gender as dichotomous variables. The focus was on internalizing disorders (esp. anxiety and depression) burdening women in particular, while externalizing disorders were neglected. Sex- and gender-specific evaluation of mental health care use has also been lacking. With respect to unfavorable health behavior in terms of adherence to prescribed protective measures, men constitute a risk group. Interpretations Women remain a vulnerable group burdened by multiple stresses and mental health symptoms. The neglect of sex and gender-specific evaluation of aggression-related disorders, substance addiction, and mental health care use in the early stage represents a potentially dangerous oversight.",Ana Nanette Tibubos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46119-B62-858,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46119-B62-858,2021-01-24,2021-01-25T00:36:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; public mental health; sex; covid-19; mental health; health behavior; gender,False
202,The Burden of Being Certain: National Identity Certainty Predicts Support for COVID-Related Draconian Measures and Outgroup Conspiracy Beliefs,"The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced various controversies. Some people debate about the usage of “draconian” measures of social distancing (e.g., lockdown). Others concern the origin of the pandemic with some buying conspiracy theories that attribute the cause of COVID-19 to the plot of some powerful outgroups. The current research examined national identity certainty (i.e., the certainty people placed in national identity) as predictor of these beliefs and attitudes. Two studies (total N = 625), one longitudinal and one cross-sectional, revealed that individual differences in national identity certainty predicted increased support of draconian measures and increased outgroup conspiracy beliefs. Moreover, realistic (but not symbolic) threat accounted for the increased support for draconian measures. Symbolic (but not realistic) threat accounted for the increased outgroup conspiracy beliefs. Our findings highlight how national identity certainty constrains individuals’ beliefs and attitudes towards issues related to the pandemic.",Kaiyuan Chen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604F-B97-6A5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604F-B97-6A5,2021-01-23,2021-01-23T13:06:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; covid-19; conspiracy theories; public health; national identity certainty,False
203,Pairing Facts with Imagined Consequences Improves Pandemic-Related Risk Perception,"The COVID-19 pandemic reached staggering new peaks during an ongoing global resurgence at the end of 2020. Although public health guidelines initially helped to slow the spread of disease, widespread pandemic fatigue and prolonged harm to financial stability and mental wellbeing have contributed to this resurgence. In this late stage of the pandemic, it is clear that new interventions are needed to support long-term behavior change. Here, we examined subjective perceived risk about COVID-19, and the relationship between perceived risk and engagement in risky behaviors. In Study 1 (N = 303), we found that subjective perceived risk is inaccurate but predicts compliance with public health guidelines. In Study 2 (N = 760), we developed a multi-faceted intervention designed to realign perceived risk with actual risk. Participants completed one of three variants of an episodic simulation task; we expected that imagining a COVID-related scenario would increase the salience of risk information and enhance behavior change. Immediately following the episodic simulation, participants completed a risk estimation task with personalized feedback about local risk levels. We found that information prediction error, a measure of surprise, drove beneficial change in perceived risk and willingness to engage in risky activities. Imagining a COVID-related scenario beforehand enhanced the effect of prediction error on learning. Importantly, our intervention produced lasting effects that persisted after a 1-3 week delay. Overall, we describe a fast and feasible online intervention that effectively changed beliefs and intentions about risky behaviors.",Alyssa Hannah Sinclair et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-66C-8F1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-66C-8F1,2021-01-20,2021-01-22T22:43:14+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; public health; intervention; prediction error; psychology; covid-19; episodic simulation; risk perception",False
204,"‘We need clear directions, if we're going to move forward. It’s as simple as that’: Teachers’ narratives during partial school reopenings in the COVID-19 pandemic","After school closures for most pupils in March 2020, following national lockdown due to COVID-19, England prepared to reopen schools to certain year groups in June. These dramatic changes in education may have frustrated teachers’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, as framed within Self-Determination Theory. The current study, which presents data from the second timepoint in a longitudinal study of teachers' experiences of COVID-19 in England, examines their experiences of partial reopenings of schools in mid-June. All twenty-four primary and secondary state school teachers were interviewed again and asked to tell stories of a low point, a high point and a turning point since their initial interviews in late April. A reflexive thematic analysis, using a mix of inductive and deductive coding was conducted, resulting in the identification of six themes: uncertainty, practical concerns, worry for pupils, importance of relationships, teacher identity, and reflections. Challenging their basic need for autonomy and competence, teachers were anxious about current and future uncertainties while navigating school reopenings. Challenging their basic need for relatedness, teachers described the importance of connecting with pupils and their families, and with colleagues. Lastly, teachers searched for holistic meaning, evaluating what it means to be a teacher and reflecting on how these circumstances have affected their personal and professional lives. Policy implications as to how teachers’ psychological needs can be met during a pandemic are discussed.",Lisa E.

205,"""Lazy, lazy teachers"": Teachers’ perceptions of how their profession is valued by society, policymakers, and the media during COVID-19","School closures during COVID-19 have led to close and very public scrutiny of how teachers have approached remote education. We know that teachers’ perceptions of how their profession is valued are associated with morale and retention as well as student attainment. The current study, therefore, examined how teachers’ perceptions of how others value their profession have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Twenty-four teachers from English state schools were interviewed in June 2020, representing mainstream primary and secondary schools and a wide range of years of experience. A reflective thematic analysis of the interview data was conducted. Four themes were identified: (1) heroes or villains?; (2) key workers or not?; (3) voiceless and disrespected; and (4) appreciated locally. Teachers reported discomfort and distress about media reports that asked them to be heroes and criticized them as villains when they questioned the safety of staff and students returning to school buildings. They resented the negative way in which their profession has been portrayed by the media, and the ramifications for public opinion. Teachers were also angry and frustrated by what they perceived as the government’s refusal to consult with them as a profession, and their failure to communicate effectively. However, teachers also reported feeling more valued than ever by their students’ parents.

206,"We distance most when our close circle does, not when we think we should","Why do we adopt new rules, such as social distancing? Although human sciences research stresses the key role of social influence in behaviour change, most COVID-19 campaigns emphasise the disease’s medical threat. In a global dataset (n= 6675), we investigated how social influences predict people’s adherence to distancing rules during the pandemic. Bayesian regression analyses controlling for stringency of local measures showed that people distanced most when they thought their close social circle did. Such social influence mattered more than people thinking distancing was the right thing to do. People’s adherence also aligned with their fellow citizens’, but only if they felt deeply bonded with their country. Self-vulnerability to the disease predicted distancing more for people with larger social circles. Collective efficacy and collectivism also significantly predicted distancing. To achieve behavioural change during crises, policymakers must emphasise shared values and harness the social influence of close friends and family.",Bahar Tuncgenc et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BB-20C-036,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BB-20C-036,2020-08-05,2021-01-22T11:23:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; vulnerability; covid-19; identity fusion; social closeness; social distancing; norm change,False

We collected nationally representative two-wave panel data in the United States, Denmark, Italy, and Hungary (N = 10,699). Pre-registered analyses indicated that COVID-19 burden increases desires to ""watch the world burn"" and predicts behavioral intentions to engage in political violence.

208,Considerations for assessment training competencies in health service psychology programs in the age of COVID-19,"Health service psychologists have made a rapid transition to delivering telepsychology services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision of remote assessment services, or teleassessment, however, has lagged behind given the limited evidence base. This delay has been uniquely chal-lenging for university training clinics, which are equally responsible for developing trainee assess-ment competencies and providing high quality assessments to clients. Training clinics have been tasked with implementing programmatic adaptation to meet this need with limited guidance. We address this gap by describing the considerations university training clinics must make under phys-ical distancing policies, including protections for the health of trainees and clients, ensuring stand-ardized administration of assessments, providing developmentally appropriate training opportuni-ties, and guaranteeing transparency in the consent and feedback processes. We recommend solu-tions to reconcile these inherent challenges and highlight training opportunities as they relate to the development of profession-wide competencies and ethical principles. These recommendations demonstrate that by integrating flexibility into program curriculums, training clinics can continue to adhere to accreditation standards while developing trainee competencies in assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Elizabeth Casline et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-CBD-50A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-CBD-50A,2020-12-17,2021-01-21T22:50:51+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; ethics; assessment competency; teleassessment; training,False
209,Using behavioural theory to understand adherence to behaviours that reduce transmission of Covid-19: evidence from the CHARIS representative national study,"Objectives: To examine the ability of four models of behaviour, namely, Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), the Common Sense Self-Regulation Model (CS-SRM) and Social Cognitive Theory and the Reasoned Action Approach (SCT and RAA) to understand adherence to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs) advised by national governments for suppression of SARS-CoV2. Design: A series of six cross-sectional telephone surveys of a random representative sample of adults living in Scotland. Methods: Self-reported adherence to three TRBs (physical distancing, wearing a face covering and hand washing), PMT, CS-SRM and SCT/RAA constructs, and sociodemographic variables were measured each week for 6-weeks (n=~500p/w; 3rd June-15th July) via a 15min telephone survey. Results: Adherence was high (‘Always’ or ‘Most times’) throughout for physical distancing and hand washing, and, when mandated, for wearing a face covering. Older people were more adherent to all TRBs. Constructs from all three models predicted all three TRBs. Intention and self-efficacy (SCT/RAA) were the only beliefs to predict to all three TRBs each week and for all groups equally; intention was the strongest predictor. The predictive utility of PMT and CS-SRM varied by TRB and by group. Of note was the observation that several illness beliefs were associated with adherence only for those who believed they had not had Covid-19. Conclusions: The CHARIS project has identified beliefs about specific behaviours, the illness and the risks associated with lower adherence rates that might be addressed in national interventions. It confirms previous findings that some groups show lower levels of adherence and might be specially targeted.",Diane Dixon et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-999-576,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-999-576,2021-01-21,2021-01-21T20:38:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
210,“My brain feels like a browser with 100 tabs open”: A longitudinal study of teachers’ mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,"Teaching and caring for pupils during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for many teachers. In a time of greater job demands and limited job resources, its impact on teachers’ mental health and wellbeing (MHWB) should be of great national and international concern, especially as it has implications for educational systems now and in the future. In this light, the current study examines 24 primary and secondary school teachers’ MHWB experiences across three time points (April to November 2020) using longitudinal qualitative trajectory analysis. Generally, teachers’ MHWB seemed to have declined throughout the pandemic, especially for primary school leaders. Moreover, using the Job Demands–Resources Model as a theoretical framework, we identified six job demands contributing negatively to teachers’ MHWB (i.e., uncertainty, workload, negative perception of the profession, concern for others’ wellbeing, health struggles, and multiple roles) and three job resources contributing positively to their MHWB (i.e., social support, work autonomy, and coping strategies).

211,The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N=8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,2020-07-22,2021-01-21T19:38:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health,False
212,Low Levels of Trust affect Guideline Adherence and Conspiracy Belief during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, and the spread of the virus needs to be curbed. We hypothesized that trust in authorities is at the root of adherence to guidelines, associated with improved information and risk perceptions. Moreover, we hypothesised that the pivotal role of trust means that populism and conspiracy thinking - both characterised by a deep distrust of authorities - are risk factors in the effort to curb the pandemic. Distrust in the information sources of authorities, but trust in social media, further typifies those endorsing populism and conspiracy theories. Through a large survey in twelve countries worldwide (N = 7,755), we show that adherence to government-generated protective guidelines is driven by concern about COVID-19, perceived risk, female gender, perceived knowledge, and trust in scientists. Endorsement of core conspiracy belief that the virus is artificially created was predicted by distrust in scientists, trust in populist governments, and distrust in non-populist governments. An examination of trust in media demonstrated that conspiracy belief was associated with trust in Facebook and distrust in institutional websites (WHO, government and healthcare). This research shows that trust in authorities, associated with access to trustworthy information, is paramount to encourage adherence to safety guidelines and avoid conspiracy thinking during the COVID-19 pandemic.

213,Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings,"COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

215,Triage Dilemmas: A Window into (Ecologically Valid) Moral Cognition,"At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, frontline professionals at intensive care units around the world faced gruesome decisions about how to ration life-saving medical resources. These events provided a unique context for moral psychologists to understand how the general public reasons about real-world dilemmas involving trade-offs between human lives—in contrast to most prior research pursuing parallel questions via hypothetical thought experiments with limited relevance to the real world. In three studies (total N = 2298), we examined people’s moral attitudes toward triage of acute coronavirus patients. Our findings indicate that people generally support utilitarian approaches to critical care triage. These utilitarian tendencies do not stem from period change in people’s moral attitudes (relative to pre-pandemic levels); rather, people favor utilitarian resolutions of critical care dilemmas more than structurally analogous, non-medical dilemmas. Support for utilitarian triage decisions was rooted in prosocial dispositions, including empathy and impartial beneficence—which defies the received wisdom in moral psychology. Finally, despite abundant evidence of political polarization surrounding Covid-19, moral attitudes toward critical care triage differed modestly between liberals and conservatives. Taken together, our findings highlight people’s robust support for utilitarian measures in the face of a global public health threat. Our results also illustrate how the dominant research methods in moral psychology may be handicapped by their reliance on hypothetical stimuli (e.g., trolley cases) and could deliver insights that do not generalize to real-world, ethical priorities.",Markus Kneer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-CBF-45F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-CBF-45F,2020-09-18,2021-01-19T18:45:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Theory and Philosophy of Science; ecological validity; covid-19; utilitarianism; triage; moral dilemmas,False
216,Perceived COVID-19 risk is attenuated by ingroup trust: Evidence from three empirical studies,"Background: The social identity model of risk taking proposes that people take more risks with ingroup members because they trust them more. While this can be beneficial in some circumstances, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it has the potential to undermine an effective public health response if people underestimate the risk of contagion posed by ingroup members, or overestimate the risk of vaccines or treatments developed by outgroup members. Methods: Three studies (two prospective surveys, one experiment) with community-based adults tested the potential for the social identity model of risk taking to explain risk perception and risk taking in the context of COVID-19. Results: Study 1 was a two-wave study with a pre-COVID baseline, and found that people who identified more strongly as a member of their neighborhood pre-COVID tended to trust their neighbors more, and perceive interacting with them during lockdown restrictions as less risky. Study 2 (N=2033) replicated these findings in a two-wave nationally representative Australian sample. Study 3 (N=216) was a pre-registered experiment which found evidence that the tendency to trust ingroup members more could be harnessed to enhance the COVID-19 response. Specifically, people were more willing to take a vaccine and perceived it to be less risky when it was developed by an ingroup compared to an outgroup source.

217,Daily associations between sleep and physical activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The day-to-day variations of sleep and physical activity are associated with various health outcomes in adults, and previous studies suggested a bidirectional association between these behaviors. The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep – physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g. inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. From a clinical perspective, care providers should monitor the effects of better sleep promotion on physical activity behaviours in their patients. Future studies should examine sleep and physical activity during a longer period and perform additional sophisticated statistical analyses.",Sarah Atoui et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-2BA-AA2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-2BA-AA2,2020-06-17,2021-01-19T11:56:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; intraindividual; insomnia; sleep; ambulatory assessment; daily; physical actvity,False
218,Information about herd immunity through vaccination and empathy promote COVID-19 vaccination intentions,"Objective: An effective vaccine against COVID-19 is a desired solution to curb the spread of the disease. However, vaccine hesitancy might hinder high uptake rates and thus undermine efforts to eliminate COVID-19 once an effective vaccine became available. The present contribution addresses this issue by examining two ways of increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: Two pre-registered online studies were conducted (N = 2,315 participants from the UK) in which knowledge about and beliefs in herd immunity through vaccination, as well as empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus, were either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). As a dependent variable, individuals’ self-reported vaccination intention once a vaccine against COVID-19 became available was assessed. Results: In Study 1 (N = 310), the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was correlated with knowledge about and belief in herd immunity (r = .58, p < .001), as well as with empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus (r = .26, p < .001). In Study 2 (N = 2,005), information about herd immunity (Cohen’s d = 0.13, p = .003) and empathy (Cohen’s d = 0.22, p < .001) independently promoted vaccination intention. Conclusions: The motivation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 was related to and could be causally promoted by both mere information about herd immunity and by empathy. As such, the present research provides a better understanding of the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19.",Stefan Pfattheicher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-E9A-7B0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-E9A-7B0,2020-09-30,2021-01-19T09:46:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; prosociality; covid-19; vaccination; empathy; herd immunity,False
219,Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life followed by a call for knowledge about how these changes have affected parental functioning, particularly in vulnerable families (Prime, Wade & Brooks, 2020). This study uses a natural experiment design to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on parental mental health, parenting stress and three dimensions of destructive interparental conflict in a heterogeneous sample characterized by pre-existing relationship problems. Results from mixed model regression analyses showed that despite significantly higher levels of parenting stress in the lockdown group (n = 744 families) compared with the control group (n = 427 families), lockdown did not adversely affect parental mental health or levels of destructive conflicts behaviors. In fact, levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict decreased during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre-existing destructive conflict levels, financial problems and age of youngest child did not moderate any of the associations. Thus, findings indicated that pre-existing family vulnerability did not predispose for reduced parental functioning during lockdown, beyond increased parenting stress. Resilient processes and an increased sense of purpose may be potential mechanisms. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings due to the welfare context of the sample and as long-term lockdown effects were not investigated. Importantly, children in vulnerable families may have been negatively impacted by increased family time, despite relatively stable parental functioning during lockdown.",Maren Sand Helland et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A,2020-12-07,2021-01-18T20:03:45+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Experimental Design and Sample Surveys; vulnerable families; covid-19; natural experiment design; parental functioning",False
220,Unrealistic optimism and HEXACO traits as predictors of risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures during the first wave of pandemic,"The aims of this study were to examine possible differences and factors that contribute to risk perception and compliance with preventive measures at the beginning (T1) and the end (T2) of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 423 participants (M = 30.29, SD = 14.45; 69% female). Compliance, risk perception and trust in information were significantly higher in T1 than T2. For risk perception, significant predictors in both T1 and T2 were age, Emotionality (HEXACO-PI-R) and Unrealistic Optimism (NLE, Negative Life Events). Trust in information was a significant predictor in T1, while Unrealistic Optimism (Positive Life Events) was a signifi-cant predictor in T2. For compliance, significant predictors in T1 were gender and trust in information while in T2 were Emo-tionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness (HEXACO-PI-R), NLE and trust in information, for both T1 and T2. In general, findings suggest a much more pronounced role of personality traits in adherence to protective measures at the end than at the beginning of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia.

221,"Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Amongst Kenyan Adolescents: Psychometric Properties, Prevalence, Psychosocial and Sociodemographic Factors","Background: We assessed the psychometric properties of standard Western-derived instruments, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and their associations with sociodemographic and psychosocial variables in a large sample of Kenyan adolescents. Methods: We administered self-report measures of depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, social support, gratitude, happiness, optimism and perceived control to 2,192 Kenyan youths (57.57% female) aged 12-19. Results: Both the PHQ-8 (α = 0.78) and GAD-7 (α = 0.82) showed adequate internal consistency. EFA with a sub-sample (N = 1096) yielded a 1-factor structure for both the PHQ-8 and GAD-7, a subsequent CFA conducted on the basis of the 1-factor model on another sub-sample (N = 1096) yielded good goodness of fit for the PHQ-8 (2=76.73; p<0.001; RMSEA=0.05; CFI=0.96; TLI=0.95) and GAD-7 (2=88.19; p<0.001; RMSEA=0.07; CFI=0.97; TLI=0.95). Some 28.06% of participants met the clinical cut-off for depressive symptoms and 30.38% for anxiety symptoms. Social support, gratitude, happiness, optimism, and perceived control were negatively associated with symptoms. Older and female adolescents reported higher symptoms, while adolescents with three or more siblings reported lower symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional data no not allow us to investigate the onset, maintenance, and course of depressive and anxiety symptoms and our large sample was not randomly sampled.

222,COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity?,"In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of lockdown that impacted individual’s lifestyles, in both professional and personal spheres. New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity. Our results provide new insights on the impact of lockdown and its positive outcomes. These measures may have inarguably negative consequences on the physical and mental health of many, but their positive impact exists as well.",Maxence Mercier et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-44D-278,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-44D-278,2020-09-01,2021-01-18T10:57:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Creativity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Innovation and Technology; covid-19; creativity development; creativity; pro-c; little-c; positive outcome; lockdown,False
223,Parental Social Isolation and Child Maltreatment Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. Objective: This study examines the association of parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting: Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Methods: Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Results: Parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after statistically controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents’ perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in “lockdown.” Conclusions: Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.",Shawna J.

224,"Resilience, mood, and mental health outcomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria","Background: The fundamental challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic may have lasting negative effects on the quality of mental health worldwide. Resilience is considered an important protective factor in reducing the risk of psychopathology in the face of various adverse events, such as the ongoing health crisis. The aims of the current study were to: (1) evaluate the predictive utility of resilience in accounting for positive and negative moods, substance use, depression and anxiety; and (2) compare negative and positive moods experienced before the pandemic to emotions reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, when the country still had low prevalence of infections and fatalities. Methods: 179 Bulgarian participants completed the international online Minnesota Global Survey on Stress and Resilience in the Face of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which included measures of resilience, depression and anxiety, substance use, positive and negative moods experienced both before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Resilience predicted higher levels of positive affect and lower anxiety, depression, and negative mood during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bulgaria. A significant increase was found in negative mood and a corresponding decrease in positive mood in the time since COVID-19 began spreading compared to before the pandemic. Conclusions: Results suggest that the initial wave of the COVID-19 crisis impacted individuals’ well-being, even in countries with relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 and associated fatalities.

225,"Noticing nature, nature connectedness and time in nature: Associations with Human and Nature’s Wellbeing during the Corona Pandemic.","During the restrictions imposed to control the coronavirus pandemic people have visited and noticed nature more. Research into the human-nature relationship often considers how visits or time in nature are related to human wellbeing. Recently, the closeness of the human-nature relationship measured by nature connectedness, and built through noticing nature, has also been considered, although rarely in concert with nature visits. Further, the reciprocal benefits of pro-nature behaviours are often overlooked. Natural England’s People and Nature Survey (PANS) in the UK was conducted during the initial pandemic response and allows further analysis of these factors. Using PANS data we assessed a number of wellbeing outcomes (loneliness, life satisfaction, worthwhile life and happiness) and pro-nature behaviours as a function of longer-term physical time in nature and psychological connectedness to nature and shorter-term visits and noticing of nature. In a baseline analysis of longer-term factors nature connectedness and time in nature were both consistent significant predictors of wellbeing measures (apart from loneliness) and pro-nature conservation behaviours. Considered alone, without controlling for longer-term measures, short-term visits and noticing were again consistent and significant predictors of three wellbeing measures. There was also a weak significant association between increased noticing of nature and increased loneliness and recent visits to nature were not associated with pro-nature conservation behaviours. A combined regression highlighted the importance of a longer-term relationship with nature in all outcomes apart from loneliness, but also revealed that, even when considered in concert with longer-term factors, currently noticing nature had a role in feeling one’s life was worthwhile life, pro-nature behaviours and loneliness.",Miles Richardson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-6BA-6E6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-6BA-6E6,2021-01-13,2021-01-16T20:15:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Natural Environments; nature connectedness; nature visits; wellbeing; pro-nature conservation behaviour.,False
226,Integrating health behavior theories to predict COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent among the American public,"Wide uptake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines is key to containing the ongoing pandemic. Integrating constructs from three prominent health behavior theories (HBT) including the extended parallel process model (EPPM), the health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the current study seeks to identify sociopsychological factors that influence American public’s COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent. An online survey was delivered to a national sample (N = 934) with demographic composition similar to the U.S. population. This study assessed the influences of risk perception and fear associated with COVID-19, beliefs about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, self-efficacy, social and psychological contexts, and demographic characteristics on people’s intention to get COVID-19 vaccines. Most respondents intended to get a COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. However, participants tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19, which may prevent them from getting vaccinated. Exposure to COVID-19 infections and deaths led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits of the vaccines were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines in general and recent vaccine history were also positively linked to COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent. This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting COVID-19 vaccines uptake intent. The results point to the importance of fostering confidence in vaccine safety in interventions seeking to promote COVID-19 vaccines uptake.",Haoran Chu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-DD3-CBB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-DD3-CBB,2021-01-15,2021-01-16T20:14:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
227,Attitudes toward Blood Donation and Deferral Policies Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,"As part of its responsibilities to protect the safety of the American public, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates blood donations. One FDA policy concerns the prohibition of blood donation by men who have sex with men (MSM) and their sexual partners. The policy risks reinforcing stigma against people in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning (LGBTQ) community. The coronavirus pandemic created an urgent need for blood products; hence, the FDA shortened the deferral period for MSM and their sexual partners. Yet, the public’s awareness and support of the deferral policy remained unclear. US community adults (N=829, Mage =46.83, 50.3% women, 9.5% LGB) rated their awareness and approval of FDA blood deferral policies, and their attitudes toward blood donations from people across sexual orientations and gender identities. Half of participants were uninformed about blood donation deferral policies affecting MSM. Participants generally reported positive attitudes toward receiving blood from heterosexual donors and neutral attitudes toward receiving blood from LGBTQ donors. Participants were inclined to believe that the 2020 policy revision was motivated by an increased demand for blood donations amid the coronavirus pandemic rather than an intent to reduce discrimination. Relative to LGB participants, heterosexual participants were less willing to receive blood from LGBTQ donors, more likely to endorse FDA blood donation deferral policies, and less likely to consider FDA policies to be discriminatory. Grounded in a minority stress framework, understanding public opinion can inform the utility of FDA’s policy and contextualize the possible negative impact on LGBTQ health.",Sarah Gobrial et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46078-51F-463,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46078-51F-463,2021-01-15,2021-01-16T20:11:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; prejudice; covid-19; lgbtq; sexual behavior; blood donor; sexual minority; msm; exclusion,False
228,Probability Discounting and Adherence to Preventive Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This brief communication reports preliminary findings of a study conducted to investigate the relationship between probability discounting and people’s adherence to preventive behaviors recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 112 adults living in Brazil completed an online survey composed of a Probability Discounting Questionnaire (PDQ) and a 10-item assessment of how often they complied with the health authorities’ recommendations (e.g., wash the hands frequently, practice social distancing, stay at home as much as possible, wear a mask when in public). Data analysis included the participants who showed higher (n = 40) and lower (n = 40) adherence to preventive behaviors. Results revealed that probability discounting measures are related to people’s preventive actions. Participants in the higher adherence group present significantly larger risk aversion indices (i.e., larger h values) than participants in the lower adherence group. Also, participants who showed lower adherence to preventive behaviors were more likely to perform risky choices in the PDQ than participants who demonstrated higher compliance with health authorities’ recommendations. These preliminary results suggest that probability discounting can play an essential role in people’s self-protective decisions during a global health emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Julio Camargo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46010-997-DF9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46010-997-DF9,2021-01-15,2021-01-16T20:11:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; covid-19; risk; medical decision-making; choice under uncertainty; compliance; probability discounting,False
229,Hong Kong University Students’ Normative Beliefs about Aggression toward Police: The Role of Ecological Risks and Future Perspective,"Ample social protests occurred in Hong Kong during 2019-2020 to achieve various political goals. One of the goals was to require an investigation of police’s excessive and brutal enforcement while handling the protests. University students were actively involved in the protests. Normative beliefs about aggression toward police (NBAGG→P) play an important role in students’ behavior during the protests. In this cross-sectional study, we quantified NBAGG→P among Hong Kong university students (N=1,025) and examined the associations between NBAGG→P and multiple ecological risks (i.e., distrust in institutions, exposure to community violence, poor family monitoring, poor university discipline and affiliation with delinquent peers). Moreover, we examined the protective and buffering role of future orientation. The results showed that about 78.6% students had participated in social protests and about 35.4% of them had engaged in aggressive acts during protests. Students reported medium levels of NBAGG→P, and NBAGG→P was positively related to participation in social protests and use of aggression during protests. Except for poor family monitoring, other ecological risks were related to higher levels of NBAGG→P. Moreover, a positive future orientation was related to lower levels of NBAGG→P. Future orientation moderated the link between distrust in institutions and NBAGG→P. The relation was stronger for students with a more positive future orientation than those with a less positive future orientation.

230,Digital Parent Training RCT Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review,"Telehealth interventions have the opportunity to scale evidenced-based therapeutics and increase service access to historically hard to reach populations, including rural, and minority groups. Behavior management parenting interventions are a best-practice intervention to treat a range of disruptive behavior disorders and family dysfunction concerns, which have traditionally occurred in person, but recently been trialed online due to growing demand and a need for remote delivery during COVID-19. There is limited and mixed information to date regarding evidence for online services and minimal research on client and therapeutic factors associated with better outcomes, which is critical for advancing efficacy in the rapidly-growing approach to treating child mental illness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (k = 24, total number of intervention participants = 1469 and control participants = 800) of the impact of digital parent training interventions on parent skill, parent mental health, and child externalizing mental health outcomes from 2000 to 2020, among children 2-12 years old, across four databases. Exclusionary criteria include programs targeted for parents of children with intellectual disabilities, autism, brain injury, nutrition/health/dental needs or primary medical diagnosis. Across outcomes, there was a modest effect size of digital parent training interventions (g =.22-.30), compared to controls using random effect two-level and multi-level models. Study heterogeneity varied across outcomes (I² = 18.6% to 66.3%). Results of publication bias were mixed across tests, but they were suggestive of a slight inflation of the effects sizes across outcomes. We tested several moderators related to child demographics, family socioeconomic status, intervention design, and risk of bias. We found the effects of digital parent training on parent skills and child outcomes were stronger if the intervention used was evidence-based, combined hybrid interactive platforms with a therapist and was compared to an inactive control. Given the limitations from the existing literature assess moderating effects regarding population characteristics (i.e. SES, parent mental health), we call on future studies to provide standardized demographics to aide future knowledge synthesis work and provide templates for shared measurement.

231,A Week During COVID-19: Online Social Interactions Predict Greater Connection and More Stress,"Who thrives while socially distancing? For this descriptive, exploratory study, we polled a sample of over 500 participants from the United States on April 8, 2020—in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when practicing social distancing was at its peak. Above and beyond other social and nonsocial activities, living and employment arrangements, personality traits, demographics, and other variables, people who spent more time interacting with close others—either in person or online—felt more socially connected. However, only interacting with close others in person, but not online, predicted greater positive affect. In contrast, people who spent more time interacting with weak ties online experienced greater negative affect and more stress. Looking at specific interaction partners, we found that people who interacted with their relatives, romantic partners, and even coworkers/classmates felt more socially connected. Living arrangements mattered little beyond people’s social interactions, except for living with one’s children, which predicted greater stress. Certain social online activities, including playing games with close ties and group/club meetings predicted greater positive affect. Amongst nonsocial activities, active leisure like exercise emerged as a robust predictor of positive affect, whereas passive leisure like watching TV predicted greater negative affect. Even during a historic pandemic and unprecedented conditions of social distancing, then, the factors that predict well-being are much the same as those already established in the literature.

232,The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdowns: A Review and Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Studies and Natural Experiments,"Lockdowns to control the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have had profound effects on everyday life worldwide, but their effect on mental health remains unclear because available meta-analyses and reviews rely mostly on cross-sectional studies. We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments investigating the relationship between COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health. A total of 25 studies involving 72,004 participants and 58 effect sizes were analyzed. Using a random effects model, we found that lockdowns had small effects on mental health symptoms, g = 0.17, SE = 0.05, 95% CI [0.06, 0.24], p = .001, but the effects on positive psychological functioning, g = -0.12, SE = 0.11, 95% CI [-0.33, 0.09], p = .27, were not significant. Multivariate analysis of effect sizes revealed significant and relatively small effect sizes for anxiety and depression, while those for social support, loneliness, general distress, negative affect, and suicide risk were not significant. Results indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies, but meta-regression analyses found no significant moderation effects for mean age, gender, continent, COVID-19 death rate, days of lockdown, publication status or study design. The psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns is small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting that lockdowns do not have uniformly detrimental effects on mental health and that most people are psychologically resilient to their effects.",Gabriele Prati et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-5AA-9DE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46168-5AA-9DE,2021-01-13,2021-01-15T19:57:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; natural experiment; anxiety; longitudinal; mental health; meta-analysis; covid-19; depression,False
233,"Deliberate Self-Harm in Adolescents During COVID-19: The Roles of Pandemic-Related Stress, Emotion Regulation Difficulties, and Social Distancing","Objectives: We used data from a large sample of Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic to conduct an ecologically valid test of etiological models of deliberate self-harm (DSH). Specifically, the study objectives were to: (1) investigate the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH, (2) test whether dimensions of emotion regulation (ER) difficulties mediated and moderated this association, including whether these effects differed by age, and (3) examine whether the mediating and moderating effects of ER difficulties were stronger for youth who engaged in more social distancing. Methods: 809 Canadian adolescents aged 12 to 18 were recruited via social media websites and completed online surveys from June 17 to July 31, 2020. Results: COVID-19-related stress was positively associated with recent DSH. Lack of emotional clarity, nonacceptance of emotional responses, and limited access to ER strategies mediated the association between COVID-19-related stress and DSH. The magnitude of these indirect effects did not differ by age. Although COVID-19-related stress and ER difficulties did not interact to predict DSH, there was a significant three-way interaction between lack of emotional awareness, COVID-19-related stress, and age. Finally, the indirect effect of COVID-19-related stress on DSH through limited access to ER strategies was stronger for youth who engaged in more social distancing. Conclusions: Overall, these findings align with etiological models that propose central roles for stress and ER difficulties in the development of DSH. Findings also underscore a need to support adolescents, particularly those with reduced in-person social contact, in adaptively coping with stress generated by pandemics.",Christina Lauren Robillard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-8E6-4A6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-8E6-4A6,2021-01-15,2021-01-15T19:26:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; emotion dysregulation; covid-19; social distancing; self-injury; adolescents; physical distancing; youth; deliberate self-harm; pandemic; emotion regulation difficulties,False
234,Sexual minority orientation is associated with greater psychological impact due to the COVID-19 crisis—evidence from a longitudinal cohort study of young Swiss men,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic and its countermeasures may have had a significant impact on the psychological well-being of specific population subgroups. The present study investigated whether sexual minority men from an ongoing cohort study of young Swiss men experienced different psychological impacts, levels of substance use and addictive behaviours. Methods An ongoing cohort sample based on the general population of young Swiss men (mean age=29.07 years; SD=1.27) was assessed before and during the COVID-19 crisis for depression, stress, sleep quality, substance use and addictive behaviours. Additionally, during the crisis, we assessed its impact in form of fear, isolation and traumatic experiences. Potential associations between these outcomes and sexual orientation (sexual minority vs heterosexual) were tested using linear regression models. Results Compared to heterosexual men, sexual minority men showed higher levels of psychological trauma (b=0.37 [0.25, 0.49]), fear (b=0.18 [0.06, 0.30]) and isolation (b=0.32 [0.20, 0.44]) due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher levels of depression (b=0.31 [0.20, 0.41]) and lower sleep quality (b=-0.13 [-0.24, -0.02]) during the crisis. These differences were to a large degree explained by higher pre-crisis levels of mental health problems and the personality dimension of neuroticism-anxiety. Sexual minority men showed higher overall levels of substance use and addictive behaviours, but these differences were already present before the crisis. Conclusion The COVID-19 crisis may have worsened pre-existing vulnerabilities in sexual minority men, leading to its greater psychological impact on them than on heterosexual men. Services offering psychological support to sexual minorities may need to be reinforced during crises.",Simon Marmet et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-5E6-4CE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-5E6-4CE,2021-01-15,2021-01-15T17:17:09+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
235,Locking down behavioural compliance: the role of emotion and emotion regulation in breaches of COVID-19 mitigation measures,"Objectives: Although health-related anxiety and worry can motivate engagement with public health behaviours, people may choose to cognitively reappraise these unpleasant emotional experiences, restoring their emotional wellbeing at the cost of public health behaviours. This study aims to investigate whether reappraisal of COVID-19 lockdown reduces anxiety and worry, creating a trade-off between short term emotional wellbeing and long-term compliance with COVID-19 lockdown policies. Design: A cross-sectional survey of New Zealand young adults (n = 278) during a strict nationwide lockdown. Methods: Participants completed measures indexing the extent of their current and future COVID-19 worry, current anxiety, COVID-19 reappraisal, knowledge of government-mandated lockdown policies, and compliance with these policies. Results: Despite high knowledge of lockdown policies, 92.5% of participants reported breaching one or more lockdown policies (M = 2.74, SD = 1.86). Counter to predictions, no relationships were found between anxiety, current worry, or future worry with COVID-19 specific reappraisal use or lockdown breaches. Participants with essential worker(s) in their lockdown ‘bubble’ reported fewer lockdown breaches, but knowledge of lockdown policies and having individual(s) at high risk of COVID-19 complications in their ‘bubble’ were unrelated to lockdown breaches. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of targeting young adults when promoting widespread compliance with public health measures and offer further insights into the role of emotion during lockdown and quarantine.",Terise Broodryk et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622A-BAF-2B1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622A-BAF-2B1,2020-12-18,2021-01-14T21:36:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; pandemic; lockdown; emotion regulation; public health behaviour; quarantine,False

Longitudinal analyses showed that all demographic groups examined (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income) experienced increases in distress after the onset of the pandemic followed by significant decreases. By September 2020 distress levels were indistinguishable from prepandemic levels for all groups.

Participants of this cross-sectional study were 388 Latinx adults who completed an online survey between June and November 2020. Almost half of participants showed clinical levels of anxiety and depression and more than a quarter of participants showed clinical levels of posttraumatic stress. Latinxs reported on average 22 types of negative pandemic life impacts. Group differences based on gender, educational attainment, income, vulnerability to COVID-19, and essential worker status were found for mental health symptoms.

238,"""Help! I Need Somebody"": Music as a Global Resource for Obtaining Wellbeing Goals in Times of Crisis","Music can reduce stress and anxiety, enhance positive mood, and facilitate social bonding. However, little is known about the role of music and related personal or cultural (individualistic versus collectivistic) variables in maintaining wellbeing during times of stress and social isolation as imposed by the COVID-19 crisis. In an online questionnaire, administered in 11 countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, Colombia, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the UK and USA, N = 5619), participants rated the relevance of wellbeing goals during the pandemic, and the effectiveness of different activities in obtaining these goals. Music was found to be the most effective activity for three out of five wellbeing goals: enjoyment, venting negative emotions, and self-connection. For diversion, music was equally good as entertainment, while it was second best to create a sense of togetherness, after socialization. This result was evident across different countries and gender, with minor effects of age on specific goals, and a clear effect of the importance of music in people’s lives. Cultural effects were generally small and surfaced mainly in the use of music to obtain a sense of togetherness.

239,Scared into Action: How Partisanship and Fear are Associated with Reactions to Public Health Directives,"Differences in political ideology are increasingly appearing as an impediment to successful bipartisan communication from local leadership. For example, recent empirical findings have shown that conservatives are less likely to adhere to COVID-19 health directives. This behavior is in direct contradiction to past research which indicates that conservatives are more rule abiding, prefer to avoid loss, and are more prevention-motivated than liberals. We reconcile this disconnect between recent empirical findings and past research by using insights gathered from press releases, millions of tweets, and mobility data capturing local movement in retail, grocery, workplace, parks, and transit domains during COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders. We find that conservatives adhere to health directives when they express more fear of the virus. In order to better understand this phenomenon, we analyze both official and citizen communications and find that press releases from local and federal government, along with the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, lead to an increase in expressions of fear on Twitter.",Mike Lindow et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E2-D12-A5A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E2-D12-A5A,2021-01-12,2021-01-14T19:28:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; covid-19; natural language processing; political ideology; tweets; word embedding; gradient boosted decision trees,False
240,Perinatal Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence for Heightened Distress in Pregnant Women Highlights the Need for Novel Interventions,"This manuscript reports on a sample of 641 pregnant women surveyed in spring 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing was at its peak in the United States. Expectant mothers described elevated psychological distress, perceived stress, loneliness, and many behavioral changes. More than half of the women in the sample endorsed depressive symptoms above clinical threshold and two-thirds reported clinically significant anxiety, with average scores for depression, anxiety, and stress more than a standard deviation higher than those measured pre-pandemic. Given this early evidence for heightened distress, treatment options that can be targeted to support perinatal women and comply with social distancing guidelines are needed. The final sections of this paper highlight the promising role of telehealth modalities and discuss specific interventions, such as Interpersonal Therapy, that may be particularly useful in treating perinatal women in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

241,Conceptual flexibility and the meaning of Covid-19: evidence from the first Italian lockdown,"Several studies highlighted the flexible character of our conceptual system. However, less is known about the construction of meaning and the impact of novel concepts on the structuring of our conceptual space. We addressed these questions by collecting free listing data from Italian participants on a newly–and yet nowadays critical–introduced concept, i.e., Covid-19, during the first Italian lockdown. We also collected data for other five illness-related concepts. Our results show that Covid-19’s representation is mostly couched in the emotional sphere, predominantly evoking fear—linked to both possible health-related concerns and social-emotional ones. In contrast with initial public debates participants did not assimilate Covid-19 neither completely to severe illnesses (e.g., tumor) nor completely to mild illnesses (e.g., flu). Moreover, we also found that Covid-19 has shaped conceptual relations of other concepts in the illness domain, making certain features and associations more salient (e.g., flu-fear; disease-mask).

242,Pandemic Grief in Poland: Adaptation of a Measure and its relationship with Social Support and Resilience,"Millions of people are mourning the death of a loved to COVID-19. According to previous studies, the circumstances of coronavirus disease-related deaths may lead to dysfunctional grief. The purpose of this study was to introduce the Polish adaptation of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) as well as to assess the relationship between dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 death, resilience and perceived social support. The adaptation was carried out on a general population sample of 286 individuals aged 18–54 years, with the evaluation being performed on a group comprising 214 people aged 18–78 years, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. The Polish version of PGS revealed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (α = 0.89). The PGS scores were associated with measures of complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression (Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale) and lower resilience (Resilience Scale 14), which confirmed the scale’s convergent validity. No relation between PGS scores and health behaviors (Inventory of Health Behaviors) was observed, which confirmed the scale’s discriminant validity. The results of the bootstrapping technique revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) and dysfunctional grief (total mediation). The results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic.",Sebastian Skalski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-7D9-04A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-7D9-04A,2021-01-11,2021-01-13T03:49:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; covid-19; resilience; dysfunctional grief; perceived social support; pandemic grief scale,False

Measures of Big Five personality, SWB (life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect) and PWB (positive relations, autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance) were obtained from a sample of young adults in Melbourne, Australia (n = 1132; 13 July to 11 August, 2020) during a second wave of viral transmission and lockdown, and an identically recruited Pre-COVID sample (n = 547). Well-being was lower in the COVID sample and differences were largest for positive affect (d = -0.48) and negative affect (d = 0.70).

244,Examining early structural and functional brain alterations in postpartum depression through multimodal neuroimaging,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects approximately 1 in 10 women after childbirth. A thorough understanding of a preexisting vulnerability for PPD will likely aid the early detection and treatment of PPD and help minimize its debilitating effects. Methods: Using a within-sample association, the study aimed to determine whether the brain’s structural and functional alterations predict the onset of depression. To that end, 157 euthymic postpartum women were subjected to a multimodal MRI scan within the first 6 days of childbirth, and were subsequently followed up for 12 weeks. Based on a clinical interview 12 weeks postpartum, participants were classified as mentally healthy or having either PPD or adjustment disorder (AD). Voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional connectivity comparisons were performed between the three groups. Results: 13.4% of women in our study developed PPD (n=21) and 12.1% (n=19) adjustment disorder (AD). The risk factors for PPD were a psychiatric history and the experience and severity of baby blues and the history of premenstrual syndrome. Despite the different risk profiles, no differences between the PPD, AD and control group were apparent based on the structural and functional neuroimaging data. At 12 weeks postpartum, a significant association was observed between Integrated Local Correlation (LCor) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score (EPDS). Conclusion: Our findings do not support the notion that the brain’s structural and resting-state functional alterations, if present, can be used as an early biomarker of PPD or AD.

245,Listening effort is not the same as speech intelligibility score,"Listening effort is a valuable and important notion to measure because it is among the primary complaints of people with hearing loss. It is tempting and intuitive to accept speech intelligibility scores as a proxy for listening effort, but this link is likely oversimplified and lacks actionable explanatory power. This study was conducted to explain the mechanisms of listening effort that are not captured by intelligibility scores, using sentence-repetition tasks where specific kinds of mistakes were prospectively planned or analyzed retrospectively. Effort measured as changes in pupil size among 20 listeners with normal hearing and 19 listeners with cochlear implants. Experiment 1 demonstrates that mental correction of misperceived words increases effort even when responses are correct. Experiment 2 shows that for incorrect responses, listening effort is not a function of the proportion of words correct, but is rather driven by the types of errors, position of errors within a sentence, and the need to resolve ambiguity, reflecting how easily the listener can make sense of a perception. A simple taxonomy of error types is provided that is both intuitive and consistent with data from these two experiments. The diversity of errors in these experiments implies that speech perception tasks can be designed prospectively to elicit the mistakes that are more closely linked with effort. Although mental corrective action and number of mistakes can scale together in many experiments, it is possible to dissociate them in order to advance toward a more explanatory (rather than correlational) account of listening effort.",Matthew Winn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46124-E44-CC1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46124-E44-CC1,2020-08-17,2021-01-11T22:53:43+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Audition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; cochlear implants; pupillometry; hearing loss; listening effort; intelligibility; speech perception",False
246,Visual Perceptual Deficit Screening in Stroke Survivors: Evaluation of Current Practice in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland,"PURPOSE Visual perceptual deficits are frequently underdiagnosed in stroke survivors compared to sensory vision deficits or visual neglect. To better understand this imparity, we evaluated current practice for screening post-stroke visual perceptual deficits. METHODS We conducted a survey targeted at stroke clinicians involved in screening visual perceptual deficits across the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. RESULTS Forty orthoptists and 174 occupational therapists responded to the survey. Visual perceptual deficit screening was primarily conducted by occupational therapists (94%), with approximately 75-100% of stroke survivors screened per month. Respondents lacked consensus on whether several common post-stroke visual deficits were perceptual or not. During screening, respondents primarily relied on self-reports and observation (94%), while assessment batteries (58%) and screening tools were underutilised (56%) and selected inappropriately (66%). Respondents reported lack of training in visual perception screening (20%) and physical/cognitive condition of stroke survivors (19%) as extremely challenging during screening. CONCLUSIONS Visual perceptual deficits are screened post-stroke at a similar rate to sensory vision or visual neglect. Underdiagnosis of visual perceptual deficits may stem from both reliance on subjective and non-standardised screening approaches, and conflicting definitions of visual perception held among clinicians. We recommend increased training provision and brief performance-based screening tools.",Michael James Colwell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622E-BE1-0A3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622E-BE1-0A3,2021-01-09,2021-01-11T21:10:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception|Vision; visual cognition; screening; service evaluation; visual percetion; occupational therapy; assessment,False
247,"Ageing, Social Distancing, and COVID-19 Risk: Who is more Vulnerable?","Perceived social support represents an important predictor of healthy ageing. The global COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the face of social relationships and exposed elderly as a particularly vulnerable population. Social distancing may represent a double-edged sword for older adults, protecting them against COVID-19 infection while also sacrificing personal interaction and attention at a critical time. Here, we consider the moderating role of social relationships as a potential influence on stress resilience, allostatic load, and vulnerability to infection and adverse health outcomes in the elderly population. Understanding the mechanisms how social support enhances resilience to stress and promotes mental and physical health into old age will enable new preventive strategies. Targeted social interventions may provide effective relief from the impact of COVID-19-related isolation and loneliness. In this regard, a pandemic may also offer a window of opportunity for raising awareness and mobilizing resources for new strategies that help build resilience for our ageing population and future generations.",Jamshid Faraji et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-FF8-A0A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-FF8-A0A,2021-01-09,2021-01-11T21:07:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience,False

Parents (N=240, Mage=38.50 years, 75% mothers) with elementary-school-aged children (Mage=9.48 years, 46% girls) in Wenzhou, one of the most impacted cities in China, reported on the presence of confirmed or suspected cases in their communities, their frequencies of consuming COVID-19-related information, fear induction practices, and their children’s trait anxiety and disease prevention practices during the outbreak (January 28 to 30, 2020). Child-reported depressive symptoms were collected between March 7 and 11, 2020, during which there were very few remaining cases and no new confirmed cases or deaths. Results. Parents’ higher frequency of virus-related information consumption but not the presence of community infection was associated with their engagement in more fear induction practices, which was in turn associated with children’s greater engagement in prevention practices during the outbreak, but more post-quarantine depressive symptoms. Child trait anxiety exacerbated the association between parent fear induction and child depressive symptoms. Conclusion. Using fear induction parenting may promote children’s willingness to cooperate and participate in disease prevention practices during the crisis but at the cost of children’s long-term mental health.",Huiguang Ren et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E8-B3B-B00,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E8-B3B-B00,2021-01-11,2021-01-11T17:00:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; fear induction; child trait anxiety; child depressive symptoms; covid-19; parenting,False
249,Homeschooling and affective well-being of parents and children during the COVID-19 pandemic: A daily diary study,"To slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus, schools around the world were closed in early 2020, transferring children’s scholastic activities to the homes and imposing a massive burden on parents and school-aged children. Using data of a 21-day diary study conducted between March and April 2020 in Germany, this work examined whether homeschooling (and parents’ involvement therein) was associated with negative parent-child interactions and affective well-being of parents and children, over and above the effect of daily stressors. Participants were 562 parents (489 mothers, Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12, range = 25-63) most of whom were married (n = 382, 68.0%). They responded to the daily items with respect to the youngest child living in their household (Mage = 9.74, SDage = 2.81, range = 6-19). On days when children were working on school tasks, parents reported more negative parent-child interactions as well as lower parental and child positive affect and higher child negative affect, but not higher parental negative affect. Moreover, days when parents were more heavily involved in learning (i.e., when children worked less independently) were days with more negative parent-child interactions, lower parental and child positive affect, and higher parental and child negative affect. Negative parent-child interactions were linked to lower affective well-being of parents and children, and partially accounted for the relation among daily stressors and affective well-being. The present work highlights the need for measures to better support school-aged children and their parents during homeschooling.",Andrea Schmidt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46051-633-C9E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46051-633-C9E,2020-10-14,2021-01-11T07:01:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; parenting; homeschooling; affective well-being; parent-child dyad; covid-19; ambulatory assessment; daily diary study,False
