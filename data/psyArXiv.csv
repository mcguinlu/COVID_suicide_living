0,Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden,"New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,2020-06-23,2020-10-16T16:11:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; employment; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health,False
1,How Does Social Distancing During COVID-19 Affect Negative Moods and Memory?,"In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment, the current best defence against COVID-19 is social distancing—staying at home as much as possible, keeping distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings. Although social distancing maximizes physical health, we know little about its psychological consequences. In this research (N = 374), we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased steadily as social distancing duration increased, at which point (~ 30 days) they began to steadily increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular. Thus, short-term social distancing might benefit psychological well-being and memory performance, but extended social distancing has the expected negative impact on mood and memory.",Weiwei Zhang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-2B8-CC1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-2B8-CC1,2020-06-23,2020-10-16T16:04:15+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; negative mood; social distancing; social isolation; false memory; covid-19",False
2,Development of Parent-Adolescent Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Stress and Coping,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the extensive measures to prevent spread of the virus have had a major impact on the daily life of families. Such changes in family routines might have an impact on the quality of parenting and the parent-adolescent relationship. However, not all families might be affected by the crisis to a similar extent. In particular, parents and adolescents who have high levels of COVID-19-related stress might experience reduced quality of parenting or parent-child relationships. Families who are able to cope actively might experience limited or even positive changes in relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current longitudinal, multi-informant, and pre-registered study used data of 240 Dutch parents and adolescents (Mage 11.4 years). Using Latent Change Score models, we examined how parent-reported parenting and adolescent-reported relationship quality changed over a six month’s period, from the pre-COVID-19 to the COVID-19 period. Moreover, we examined the moderating role of parents’ and adolescents’ COVID-19-related stress, coping, and the interaction between stress and coping on relationship change. Results showed that on average both the amount of warmth and conflict in parent-adolescent relationships decreased. For positive parenting, there was a significant interaction effect of stress and coping, with active coping leading to a mitigated decline in the quality of parenting only in families who experienced low levels of COVID-19-related stress.",Monika H.

3,A meta-analytic review of the Self-Administered Interview: Quantity and accuracy of details reported on initial and subsequent retrieval attempts,"The Self-Administered Interview (SAI©) is designed to elicit detailed witness reports in the aftermath of incidents. In two sets of meta-analyses, we compared the number of correct details reported, the number of incorrect details reported, and the accuracy of reports provided by witnesses in initial reports (SAI© vs. other reporting formats) and in subsequent accounts (initial SAI© vs. no initial SAI©). The number of comparisons ranged from 15 to 19, (N = 722 to 977). For initial accounts, the SAI© was associated with more correct details and more incorrect details than other reporting formats; accuracy was slightly lower for the SAI© than for other reporting formats. Subsequent accounts were more detailed and accurate for witnesses who had completed an initial SAI© than for those who had not. The SAI© is an effective tool for capturing detailed initial accounts and for preserving witness memory until a formal interview can be conducted.",Ruth Horry et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-C88-59B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-C88-59B,2020-10-16,2020-10-16T15:58:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; meta-analysis; self-administered interview; investigative interviewing; eyewitness testimony; eyewitness memory,False
4,Face-touching behavior as a possible correlate of mask-wearing: A video observational study of public place incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Most countries in the world have recommended or mandated face masks in some or all public places during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, mask-wearing has been thought to increase people’s face-touching frequency and, thus, the risk of self-inoculation. Across two studies, we video observed the face-touching behavior of members of the public in Amsterdam and Rotterdam (the Netherlands) during the first wave of the pandemic. Study 1 (n = 383) yielded evidence in favor of the absence of an association between mask-wearing and face-touching (defined as touches of face or mask), and Study 2 (n = 421) replicated this result. Secondary outcome analysis of the two studies—separately and with pooled datasets—found a robust negative association between mask-wearing and hand contacts with the face and t-zone (i.e., eyes, nose, and mouth). Our results alleviate the concern that mask-wearing has an adverse face-touching effect.",Lasse Suonperä Liebst et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-F15-649,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-F15-649,2020-08-22,2020-10-16T15:15:12+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
5,Why did Israelis comply with COVID-19 Mitigation Measures during the initial first wave lockdown?,"This paper investigates why Israeli citizens complied with measures taken to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus in early April. At the time, Israel had relatively stringent mitigation measures that encouraged people to stay at home and keep a safe social distance. The data of 411 adult participants, gathered using survey research, showed that overall, compliance levels at that time were high. It finds that compliance depended on a combination of moral factors, such as people’s moral duty to obey the law and people’s tendency to obey the law generally. In addition, people who had friends over 75 years old were more likely to comply. Furthermore, people were more likely to comply if they were able to do so, and less likely to violate if they did not have the opportunity to do so. The study did not find that fear of punishment (deterrence) was significantly associated with compliance. Overall, these findings are in line with studies conducted the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands.",Anne Leonre De Bruijn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F6-260-A1F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F6-260-A1F,2020-08-28,2020-10-16T15:05:42+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; impulsivity; safe distance measures; procedural justice; israel; public health; political orientation; deterrence; religion; obligation to obey the law; authority mistrust; compliance; social norms; social distancing; covid-19; technological surveillance; emotions; trust in media; minorities; trust in science",False
6,Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing,"Covid-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. We conducted two online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards, COVID-19 beliefs, social distancing behaviors, and mental health symptoms. We used the initial study (N = 233) to form our hypotheses about social distancing behaviors and we ran the second, pre-registered study (N = 243) to determine if these relationships replicated. We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Although older adults reported being more likely to contract Covid-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall Covid-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.",Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,2020-07-17,2020-10-16T14:31:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging,False
7,"Loneliness, college belongingness, subjective vitality, and psychological adjustment during coronavirus pandemic: Development of the College Belongingness","Loneliness is a serious risk factor for healthy development and flourishing. Although loneliness has been revealed to play an important role in psychological health and well-being, little is known about moderating and mitigating mechanisms underlying this association, especially, during adverse experiences (e.g., coronavirus pandemic). The current study purposed to explore whether subjective vitality mediated the association of loneliness with psychological well-being (i.e., psychological adjustment), and whether college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on students’ well-being in the context of loneliness. The sample of this study comprised of 333 undergraduate students (69% female) from a state university in Turkey. They ranged in age between 19 and 45 years (M= 22.13, SD= 4.55). Findings from mediation analysis revealed that loneliness had a significant predictive effect on subjective vitality and psychological adjustment challenges. Subjective vitality also mediated the effect of loneliness on psychological adjustment of college students. Further, college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on adjustment and had a protective effect on the association between loneliness and subjective vitality in college students. These results provide evidence suggesting that college belongingness and subjective vitality are important mechanisms that may help to develop prevention and intervention strategies to foster psychological health and well-being of students at university settings",Gökmen Arslan,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46135-CCE-D6D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46135-CCE-D6D,2020-09-22,2020-10-16T10:52:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; subjective vitality; loneliness; psychological adjustment; college belongingness,False
8,"Therapeutic alliance, social inclusion and infection control - Towards pandemic-adapted mental health care services in Switzerland","The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the Swiss mental health care system. Many services were downsized or closed and admission to treatment and care institutions was restricted during lockdown. While these measures were necessary according to the general containment and mitigation strategies of federal and cantonal authorities, this situation has had negative consequences for care and treatment of service users. This paper asks to re-think key aspects of the Swiss mental health care system that have demonstrated to be not adaptable to the pandemic. In particular, the paper suggests diversifying care and treatment settings and strengthening outpatient and outreach services.

9,Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment (NEAT): Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Neurocognitive deficits (NCDs) and associated meta-cognition difficulties associated with chronic substance use often delay the learning and change process necessary for addiction recovery and relapse prevention. However, very few cognitive remediation programs have been developed to target NCDs and meta-cognition for substance users. The study described herein aims to investigate the efficacy of a multi-component neurocognitive rehabilitation and awareness program termed ‘Neurocognitive Empowerment for Addiction Treatment’(NEAT). NEAT is a fully manualized, cartoon-based intervention involving psychoeducation, cognitive practice, and compensatory strategies relevant across 10 major cognitive domains, including aspects of attention, memory, executive functions, and decision-making. Method/design: In a single-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT), 80 female opioid and/or methamphetamine users will be recruited from an addiction recovery program providing an alternative to incarceration for women with substance use related offenses. Eight groups of 9-12 participants will be randomized into NEAT or treatment-as-usual (TAU). NEAT involves 14 90-min sessions, delivered twice weekly. The primary outcome is change in self-reported drug craving from before to after intervention using obsessive compulsive drug use scale. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include additional psychological, neurocognitive and structural and functional neuroimaging measures. Clinical measures will be performed at five time points (pre- and post- intervention, 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up); neuroimaging measures will be completed at pre- and post-intervention. Discussion: The present RCT is the first study to examine the efficacy of an adjunctive neurocognitive rehabilitation and awareness program for addiction. Results from this study will provide initial information concerning potential clinical efficacy of the treatment, as well as delineate neural mechanisms potentially targeted by this novel intervention. Trial registration: This trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov on 22 April 2019 with NCT03922646 as clinicalTrials.gov identifier.",Hamed Ekhtiari et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46027-CF7-5C6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46027-CF7-5C6,2020-06-18,2020-10-15T22:28:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; meta-cognition; methamphetamine; neurocognitive deficits; substance use disorder; rehabilitation; opioid; women; diversion program; addiction; awareness,False
10,Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review,"The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.",Jenna Sung et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801,2020-06-18,2020-10-15T22:08:15+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy,False
11,Formalizing interdisciplinary collaboration in the CogSci community,"Is cognitive science interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary? We contribute to this debate by examining the authorship structure and topic similarity of contributions to the Cognitive Science Society from 2000 to 2019. We compare findings from CogSci to abstracts from the Vision Science Society over the same time frame. Our analysis focuses on graph theoretic features of the co-authorship network—edge density, transitivity, and maximum subgraph size—as well as clustering within the topic space of CogSci contributions. We also combine structural and semantic information with an analysis of homophily. We validate this approach by predicting new collaborations in this year’s CogSci proceedings. Our results suggest that cognitive science has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the last 19 years. More broadly, we argue that a formal quantitative approach which combines structural co-authorship information and semantic topic analysis provides inroads to questions about the level of interdisciplinary collaboration in the cognitive science community.",Lauren A.

12,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health: A Longitudinal Examination of Risk and Protective Factors,"The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to unprecedented changes in daily living. College students may face unique challenges associated with these changes. In the present study, college students (N = 205) completed a battery of questionnaires in April of 2020, after having completed similar measures 8, 5, and 2 months prior as part of a larger study. A repeated measures ANOVA suggested significantly greater depression and anxiety symptom severity during the pandemic than at any other time during the 2019-2020 academic year. Static and modifiable factors associated with psychological distress and controlling for pre-existing psychological distress were examined. Cognitive and behavioral avoidance was the most consistent predictor of psychological distress during the pandemic. Online social engagement and problematic Internet use also conferred greater risk.

13,Neurotic coronavirus generation? The report from the second wave of research on the students from Kraków,"The report presents the results of the second wave of research conducted among the students of the Pedagogical University of Kraków. The research method was an on-line survey (CAWI) on the sample of 1927 respondents. The comparison of responses from both surveys indicates that the change in attitudes and mental condition of the respondents occurred. After almost three months of quarantine the youth is less interested in the pandemic, has lower fear of the coronavirus, evaluates the actions taken by government to combat the pandemic worse. A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education.

14,Social and behavioural responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bosnia and Herzegovina,"In this paper we report results from an online study conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). The study examined a range of social and behavioural responses by youth from different ethnic backgrounds and across 63 cities (N = 569). More specifically, the study focused on investigating the relationship between threat perceptions, public health behaviours, stress and social cohesion. As expected, results indicate that higher perceptions of threat were related to higher compliance to safety and health measures despite extremely extremely low levels of political trust. Surprisingly, participants reported relatively low levels of stress despite high social isolation and physical restrictions. These results could partially be explained by an increased level of family interactions.

15,Daily associations between sleep and physical activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The day-to-day variations of sleep and physical activity are associated with various health outcomes in adults, and previous studies suggested a bidirectional association between these behaviors. The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep – physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g. inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. From a clinical perspective, care providers should monitor the effects of better sleep promotion on physical activity behaviours in their patients.

16,"Increased mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruption during the spring of 2020. Many college students were told to leave campus at spring break and to complete the semester remotely. This study evaluates effects of this disruption on student well-being. A sample of 148 students (86.5% female, 49.3% White) completed measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use during the spring 2020 semester at a university in the southeastern U.S. Their results were compared to those of 240 students (87.9% female, 64.2% White) who completed the same measures in the fall 2019 semester. Participants in spring 2020 reported more mood disorder symptoms, perceived stress, and alcohol use than did pre-pandemic participants. Worry about COVID-19 was negatively associated with well-being in multiple domains. Additionally, White students reported a greater effect of the pandemic on well-being than did African American students. Young adults appear to be less vulnerable to the most serious medical complications associated with COVID-19 but nonetheless experience psychological effects from the pandemic. Universities and practitioners who work with college students can help young adults manage their symptoms and avoid behaviors like risky alcohol use when confronted with stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",Nora Elizabeth Charles,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-CA0-ACA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-CA0-ACA,2020-06-17,2020-10-15T15:57:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; stress; covid-19; depression; coronavirus; young adults; mental health; alcohol,False
17,Further to the left. Stress-induced increase of spatial pseudoneglect during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Background The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the lockdown in Italy, do impact psychological health; yet, less is known about their effect on cognitive functioning. The transactional theory of stress predicts reciprocal influences between perceived stress and cognitive performance. However, the effects of a period of stress due to social isolation on spatial cognition and exploration have been little examined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effects and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on spatial cognition tasks, particularly those concerning spatial exploration, and the physiological leftward bias known as pseudoneglect. A right-hemisphere asymmetry for spatial attention processes crucially contributes to pseudoneglect. Other evidence indicates a predominantly right-hemisphere activity in stressful situations. We also analyzed the effects of lockdown on coping strategies, which typically show an opposite pattern of hemispheric asymmetry, favoring the left hemisphere. If so, then pseudoneglect should increase during the lockdown and be negatively correlated with the efficacy of coping strategies. Methods One week before the start of the lockdown due to Covid-19 in Italy (T1), we had collected data from a battery of behavioral tests including tasks of peri-personal spatial cognition. During the quarantine period, from late April to early May 2020 (T2), we repeated the testing sessions with a subgroup of the same participants (47 right-handed students, mean age = 20, SD = 1.33). At both testing sessions, participants performed digitized neuropsychological tests, including a cancellation task, radial arm maze task and Raven’s advanced progressive matrices. Participants also completed a newly developed COVID-19 Student Stress Scale, based on transactional models of stress, and the COPE-NIV to assess coping orientation. Results The tendency to start cancellation from a left-sided item, to explore first a left-sided arm of the maze, and to choose erroneous response items on the left side of the page on Raven’s matrices, increased from T1 to T2. The degree of pseudoneglect increment positively correlated with perceived stress, and negatively correlated with Positive Attitude and Problem-Solving COPE-NIV subscales.

18,Cohort Profile: Chinese Color Nest Project,"The ongoing CCNP was established to plot normative growth curves for brain structure and function across the human lifespan, and link age-related changes in brain imaging measures with psycho-behavioral functions at the behavioral, cognitive and emotional levels using an accelerated longitudinal design. It comprises three phases: developmental CCNP (devCCNP: 6-20 years), standardizing CCNP (stdCCNP: 20-60 years) and aging CCNP (ageCCNP: 60-90 years). The devCCNP started in 2013 and has successfully acquired CCNP-SWU data with three repeated measurements ( the trial stage of devCCNP), and accumulated CCNP-CAS baseline data (the second stage of devCCNP). CCNP-SWU consists of 201 age-sex stratified schoolchildren at enrollment (100 children followed up for 2.5 years at 1.25-year intervals) while CCNP-CAS has been recruiting participants since July 2018, and has collected data from 133 eligible children so far. A T1-weighted MRI and two resting functional MRI scans were acquired across three waves in CCNP-SWU with the same imaging protocols on a Siemens Trio 3T scanner at Southwest University in Chongqing, China. CCNP-SWU obtained longitudinal biophysical, social, behavioral and cognitive data via parent-reported questionnaires, self-reported questionnaires, behavioral assessment, as well as E-Prime computer tasks. Data were collected on the impact of COVID-19 on children’s learning and daily life from 46 children between March and May 2020. Children’s emotional states during COVID-19 pandemic were also measured.

19,Priming reasoning increases intentions to wear a face covering to slow down COVID-19 transmission,"Finding mechanisms to promote the use of face masks is fundamental during the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic response, when shelter-in-place rules are relaxed and some segments of the population are allowed to circulate more freely. Here we report three pre-registered studies (total N = 1,920), using an heterogenous sample of people living in the USA, showing that priming people to “rely on their reasoning” rather than to “rely on their emotions” significantly increases their intentions to wear a face covering. Compared to the baseline, priming reasoning promotes intentions to wear a face covering, whereas priming emotion has no significant effect. These findings have theoretical and practical implications. Practically, they offer a simple and scalable intervention to promote intentions to wear a face mask. Theoretically, they shed light on the cognitive basis of intentions to wear a face covering.",Valerio Capraro et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46082-D79-40B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46082-D79-40B,2020-06-16,2020-10-15T15:47:59+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Reasoning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; pandemic; face coverings; sars-cov-2; messages; appeal; face masks; covid-19; priming; reason; emotion; coronavirus; dual process",False
20,"Conspiratorial thinking during COVID-19: The roles of paranoia, delusion-proneness, and intolerance to uncertainty","The COVID-19 global pandemic has left many feeling a sense of profound uncertainty about their world, safety, and livelihood. Explanatory frameworks to make sense of this uncertainty are offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individual differences that predispose towards conspiratorial thinking (CT) have been investigated by past work, but never in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global pandemic. In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia mediated the relationship between intolerance to uncertainty and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in intolerance to uncertainty, delusion-proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of crisis and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings provide evidence that specific individual differences can create susceptibility to misinformation and may have implications for message framing strategies when designing informational interventions.",Emmett M.

21,Homeschooling and affective well-being of parents and children during the COVID-19 pandemic: A daily diary study,"To slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus, schools around the world were closed in early 2020, transferring children’s scholastic activities to the homes and imposing a massive burden on parents and school-aged children. Using data of a 21-day diary study conducted between March and April 2020 in Germany, this work examined whether homeschooling (and parents’ involvement therein) was associated with negative parent-child interactions and affective well-being of both, parents and children, over and above the effect of daily stressors. On days when children were working on school tasks, parents (N = 562) reported more negative parent-child interactions as well as lower parental and child positive affect and higher child negative affect, but not higher parental negative affect. Moreover, days when parents were more heavily involved in learning (i.e., when children worked less independently on school tasks) were days with more negative parent-child interactions, lower parental and child positive affect, and higher parental and child negative affect. Negative parent-child interactions were also linked to lower affective well-being of parents and children, and partially accounted for the relation among daily stressors and affective well-being of parents and children. Furthermore, parent-child interactions generally were worse in families in which children worked on school tasks either very rarely or on approximately all days of the study. The present work illustrates the negative consequences of school closures on the parent-child dyad and highlights the need for measures to better support school-aged children and their parents in the learning process at home.",Andrea Schmidt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46051-633-C9E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46051-633-C9E,2020-10-14,2020-10-14T13:05:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; parenting; homeschooling; affective well-being; parent-child dyad; covid-19; ambulatory assessment; daily diary study,False
22,"Math matters during a pandemic: A novel, brief educational intervention combats whole number bias to improve health decision-making and predicts COVID-19 risk perceptions and worry across 10 days","At the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our interdisciplinary team hypothesized that a mathematical misconception--whole number bias (WNB)--contributed to incorrect beliefs that COVID-19 was less fatal than the flu. We created a novel, five-minute online educational intervention, leveraging evidence-based cognitive science research, to encourage accurate COVID-19 and flu fatality rate calculations and comparisons. As predicted, adults (N = 1,297) randomly assigned to the intervention were more likely to correctly answer health decision-making problems and were less likely to report WNB errors in their problem-solving strategies relative to control participants. There were no immediate effects of condition on COVID-19 risk perceptions and worry; however, those in the intervention group did exhibit increased perceived risk and worry across 10 days of daily diaries. The intervention did not cause distress; instead, it increased positive affect. Ameliorating WNB errors could impact people’s risk perceptions about future health crises.",Clarissa A.

We report on the effectiveness of different public figures at promoting social distancing in 6 countries severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Across countries and demographic strata, immunology expert Dr. Anthony Fauci achieved the highest level of respondents’ willingness to reshare a call to social distancing, followed by a government spokesperson.

24,Resilience During Uncertainty. Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue,"Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.",Jonas P.

25,Source of Information in Times of Health Crisis: Evidence from Turkey During COVID-19,"Aim: Media as a source of information can shape public opinion toward COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the source of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors - age, gender, educational attainment, and perceived economic level – on source of information. Subject and Methods: An online survey (n = 4,624) was conducted on the Turkish public during early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable source of information. Higher age, educational attainment, and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism, and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family, and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and that postgraduates attended informative meeting and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status respectively watched more TV and read more newspapers while people with low socioeconomic status attended less in informative meetings.

26,The Effect of COVID-19 Anxiety on General Health: The Role of COVID-19 Coping,"Background and Objectives: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has unprecedently affected many aspects of people’s lives including their health. This study examined the mediating effect of COVID-19 coping strategies on the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health. Design: Cross-sectional, correlational study. Methods: Participants (70% females) included 4,624 adults (Mage=30.29±10.97 years) collected through online survey. Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded a one-factor structure for the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, COVID-19 Coping Scale, and General Health Scale which exhibited good internal consistency reliability. Findings showed that COVID-19 anxiety was negatively related with COVID-19 coping and general health. COVID-19 coping had a positive relationship with general health. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that COVID-19 coping partially mediated the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and general health.

27,Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study,"Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched case–control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals.

28,Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention,"The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001). On average, differences in their perceived ability to handle lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic were positive, but small and at the level of a nonsignificant trend (dav=0.13, dz=0.14, p=0.066).

29,"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.",Jeffrey Wardell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593,2020-06-15,2020-10-13T18:30:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; stress; income; alcohol problems; social isolation; drinking alone; depression; coping; solitary drinking; alcohol; covid-19; social distancing; coronavirus; drinking motives; parent,False
30,Reduced social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample,"Antisocial behaviors cause harm, directly or indirectly, to others’ welfare. The novel coronavirus pandemic has increased the urgency of understanding a specific form of antisociality: behaviors that increase risk of disease transmission. Because disease transmission-linked behaviors tend to be interpreted and responded to differently than other antisocial behaviors, it is unclear whether general indices of antisociality predict contamination-relevant behaviors. In a preregistered study using an online U.S. sample we found that individuals reporting high levels of antisociality engage in fewer social distancing measures: they report leaving their homes more frequently (p=.016, n=117) and standing closer to others while outside (p<.001, n=114). These relationships were observed after controlling for sociodemographic variables, illness risk, and use of protective equipment. Antisociality was not significantly associated with level of worry about the coronavirus. These findings suggest that more antisocial individuals may pose health risks to themselves and their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Katherine O'Connell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-8B3-BC8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-8B3-BC8,2020-06-15,2020-10-13T11:46:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; adult personality; covid-19; social distancing; antisocial,False
31,Compliance in the 1.5 Meter Society: Longitudinal Analysis of Citizens’ Adherence to COVID-19 Mitigation Measures in a Representative Sample in the Netherlands,"In the month of May, the Netherlands moved out of the “intelligent lockdown”, and into the “1.5 meter society”, which aims to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic by means of safe-distance measures. This paper assesses how Dutch citizens have complied with these social distancing measures. It analyses data from two surveys conducted in May (between 8-14 and between 22-26) among nationally representative samples (N = 984 and N = 1021). We find that a combination of factors explain social distancing compliance. On the one hand we see that people are more likely to comply if they have an intrinsic motivation to do so, when they have the capacity to comply, when they have good impulse control, when they think compliance is normal, and when they see a general duty to obey rules generally. The paper also assesses how compliance has changed over time, assessing changes in May as well as how these are different from compliance with lockdown measures in April. During this period, there has been a gradual decline in compliance that coincides with a decline in intrinsic motivations and capacity for compliance, and there has been an increase in opportunities to violate the measures. The paper assesses what these changes may mean for current and future success of Covid-19 mitigation measures.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46160-FEE-A7E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46160-FEE-A7E,2020-06-15,2020-10-13T11:45:32+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; trust in media; social distancing; procedural justice; public health; impulsivity; trust in science; deterrence; safe distance measures; 1.5 meter society; compliance; emotions; intelligent lockdown; obligation to obey the law; covid-19; netherlands; social norms; political orientation",False

This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample.

33,‘Distancers’ and ‘non-distancers’? The potential social-psychological impact of moralising COVID-19 mitigating practices on sustained behaviour change,"COVID-19 mitigating practices such as “hand-washing”, “social distancing” or “social isolating” are constructed as ‘moral imperatives’, required to avert harm to oneself and others. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigating practices is presently high among the general public, and stringent lockdown measures supported by legal and policy intervention has facilitated this. In the coming months, however, as rules are being relaxed and individuals become less strict, and thus the ambiguity in policy increases, the maintenance of recommended social distancing norms will rely on more informal social-interactional processes. We argue that the moralisation of these practices, twinned with relaxations of policy, may likely cause interactional tension between those individuals who do vs. those who do not uphold social distancing in the coming months: i.e., derogation of those who adhere strictly to COVID-19 mitigating practices and group polarisation between ‘distancers’ and ‘non-distancers’. In this paper we explore how and why these processes might come to pass, their impact on an overall societal response to COVID-19, and the need to factor such processes into decisions regarding how to lift restrictions.",Annayah Miranda Beatrice Prosser et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-27F-DAF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-27F-DAF,2020-06-15,2020-10-13T11:44:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intergroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; shaming; mask wearing; social distancing; behaviour change; practices; social identities; social policy; moralisation; covid-19; covidiots,False
34,Mood Symptoms Predict COVID-19 Pandemic Distress but not Vice Versa: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale and was argued to have negatively impacted the population’s mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These find-ings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Benjamin A Katz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-A9E-78B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-A9E-78B,2020-06-11,2020-10-13T11:42:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; depression; covid-19; psychological stress; equivalence testing,False
35,Well-Being and COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beings’ livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship between people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Method: 222 participants (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of well-being and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. Results: The results showed that people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants’ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: People’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and people’s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety, as well as finding ways to alleviate people’s COVID-19 anxiety.",Zhuojun Wang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612E-F41-854,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612E-F41-854,2020-06-15,2020-10-13T11:41:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; cross-lagged analysis; china; covid-19 anxiety; well-being; longitudinal design,False
36,"Culture, COVID-19, and Collectivism: A Paradox of American Exceptionalism?","We examined archival data from 98 countries (Study 1) and the 48 contiguous United States (Study 2) on country/state-level collectivism, COVID-19 case/death rates, relevant covariates (per-capita GDP, population density, spatial dependence), and in the U.S., percent of non-Whites. In Study 1, country-level collectivism negatively related to both cases (r = -.28) and deaths (r = -.40) in simple regressions; however, after controlling for covariates, the former became non-significant (rp = -.07), but the later remained significant (rp = -.20). In Study 2, state-level collectivism positively related to both cases (r = .56) and deaths (r = .41) in simple regressions, and these relationships persisted after controlling for all covariates except race, where a state’s non-White population dominated all other predictors of COVID-19 cases (rp = .35) and deaths (rp = .31).

37,The Role of Trust and Information in Adherence to Protective Behaviors & Conspiracy Thinking during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Infodemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, and in order to halt it, the spread of the virus needs to be curbed. The World Health Organization and governments have put forward protective guidelines to stop the spread, but adherence to these guidelines is still variable. Through a large survey in twelve countries worldwide (N = 7,755), we show that the information about COVID-19 which is accurate and trustworthy is paramount for the adherence to protective guidelines. Specifically, adherence to safety precautions is predicted by concern, gender, perceived risk, perceived knowledge, and trust in scientists. Adherence to self-centered protective behaviors was predicted by distrust in one’s country’s government and the conspiracy belief that the virus is artificially made. Conspiracy thinking was predicted by distrust in scientists and governments globally, and trust in social media, whereas perceived knowledge was associated with trust in national institutions’ websites.",Valerie Van Mulukom,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-C7E-7A4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-C7E-7A4,2020-08-01,2020-10-13T07:27:26+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; prevention guidelines; covid-19; covid-19 guidelines; health behaviors; information; adherence; safety precautions; compliance; coronavirus; conspiracy beliefs; trust in government; trust in science,False
38,"Mixed Emotions, But Not Positive or Negative Emotions, Facilitate Legitimate Virus-Prevention Behaviors and Eudaimonic Outcomes in the Emergence of the COVID-19 Crisis","We report four studies (N = 1419) which examined people’s emotional reactions from March to April 2020 when the COVID-19 crisis was unfolding rapidly with exponentially increasing rates of infections and fatalities. Specifically, we examined how emotions influenced the endorsement of virus-prevention behaviors that may contribute to slowing the spread of COVID-19, as well as eudaimonic functioning during the crisis. Study 1A and 1B provided naturalistic evidence that mixed emotions predicted endorsements of legitimate virus-prevention behaviors and eudaimonic functioning in both the United States and Singapore. Study 2 replicated Study 1 and provided evidence for receptivity as a mediator between mixed emotions and these outcomes. Finally, Study 3 provided experimental evidence that mixed emotions causally increased endorsements of legitimate virus-prevention behaviors and eudaimonic functioning. Across all studies, positive and negative emotions were unrelated to legitimate virus-prevention behaviors, while relationships with eudaimonic functioning were inconsistent.

39,The latent and item structure of COVID-19 fear: A comparison of four COVID-19 fear questionnaires using SEM and network analyses,"Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several reports have shown that fear relating to COVID-19 has sharply increased. To measure fear of COVID-19, various questionnaires have been developed in parallel. However, fear concerning COVID-19 is not necessarily a uniform construct and the different questionnaires may cover diverse aspects. To examine the underlying structure of fear of COVID-19, we conducted structural equation modelling and network analyses on four different scales in a large online sample (N = 829). Particularly, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (Ahorsu et al., 2020), the Fear of the Coronavirus Questionnaire (Mertens et al., 2020), and the COVID Stress Scales (Taylor et al., 2020) were included in our study, along with a new scale that also assessed socio-economic worries relating to COVID-19. We found that fear of COVID-19 was best classified into four different clusters: Fear of health-related consequences, fear of supplies shortages and xenophobia, fear about socio-economic consequences, and symptoms of fear (e.g., compulsions, nightmares). Generally worded items (e.g., “I worry about COVID-19”) had the highest centrality in the network analyses.

40,Face masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness,"Face masks became the symbol of the global fight against the coronavirus. While face masks’ medical benefits are clear, little is known about their psychological consequences. To address this gap, we recruited 191 German adults for our preregistered study on face masks’ effect on emotion-recognition accuracy and social judgments (perceived trustworthiness, likability, and closeness). Using multilevel (logistic) regression analyses, we found that participants were less likely to accurately categorize an emotion expression on a masked (vs. unmasked) face. Moreover, face masks diminished perceptions of closeness. Exploratory analyses further revealed that face masks buffered the negative effect of negative (vs. non-negative) emotion expressions on perceptions of trustworthiness, likability, and closeness. Associating face masks with the coronavirus’ dangers predicted higher perceptions of closeness for masked but not for unmasked faces. By highlighting face masks’ effects on social functioning, our findings inform policymaking and point at contexts where alternatives to face masks are needed.",Felix Grundmann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46038-88F-4D0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46038-88F-4D0,2020-10-09,2020-10-12T21:50:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social judgments; coronavirus; face masks; emotion perception; perceived closeness,False
41,"Meaningful Living, Resilience, Affective Balance, and Psychological Health Problems during COVID-19","The present study sought to investigate the mediating effect of the affective balance and resilience on the association between meaningful living and psychological health problems among Turkish young adults in the context of pandemic. Participants were 359 Turkish young adults, comprising of primarily female (68.2%), and their age ranged between 18 to 43 (age M = 20.67, SD = 3.62). Findings from this study indicated that meaningful living had a positive predictive effect on resilience and positive affect, as well as a negative predicative on psychological health challenges and negative affect. Resilience and affective balance also mediated the effect of meaningful living on psychological health of young adults. These results suggest that resilience and affective balance are important aspects of implementing meaning-based preventions and interventions. Thus, meaning–based prevention and intervention strategies could be designed to not only to improve individuals’ life meaning and purpose but also build up resilience and positive affective experiences to foster their psychological health.",Gökmen Arslan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46120-D72-581,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46120-D72-581,2020-06-10,2020-10-12T19:40:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; psychological health; positive psychology; resilience; meaningful living; affect,False
42,Substitution behaviors among casino gamblers during COVID-19 precipitated casino closures,"The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the closure of licensed casinos throughout the United States of America in March and April 2020. This study sought to examine how Americans who gamble responded to the COVID-19 lockdown, including migration to online gambling, and changes in substance use and use of other technologies. On April 9, 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional study of 424 Americans who have gambled in the last three months. Self-reported changes in online gambling and other addictive behaviors since the onset of COVID-19 and problem gambling severity were measured. Overall, online gambling decreased following the onset of COVID-19 casino closures, while alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use increased among gamblers. Among gamblers who reported no online gambling involvement prior to COVID-19, 15% reported migrating to online gambling. These migrators had higher levels of problem gambling and lower income than gamblers who had never gambled online. The response to COVID-19 is heterogeneous: the majority of gamblers reported reducing their online gambling but increased their substance use. A minority of vulnerable gamblers substituted casino gambling with online gambling. Because these individuals are characterized by problem gambling symptoms and lower income, they may be considered a vulnerable group.",Silas Xuereb et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-658-D16,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-658-D16,2020-06-24,2020-10-12T19:30:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; addiction; substance use; gambling; covid-19; substitution,False
43,Barriers and facilitators to mood and confidence in pregnancy and early parenthood during COVID-19 in the UK: A mixed-methods synthesis survey,"Background: Parents’ well-being during pregnancy and early parenthood is critical for children’s development. Environmental stressors can significantly challenge parents’ well-being. Aims: To investigate how COVID-19 and associated restrictions influence mood and parenting confidence of expectant parents and those in early parenthood, identifying barriers and facilitators. Methods: We used a cross-sectional online survey to collect data from 590 expectant parents and parents of infants (564 females) during the most restrictive phase of the lockdown in the UK. Survey included a mixture of forced-choice and open-ended questions pertaining to mood, perceived social support, media use, online interactions, and parenting expectations. Quantitative data were analysed using multiple linear regression and proportional odds models, while an inductive thematic analysis was employed for qualitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data were qualitatively synthesised. Results: A decrease in mood and parenting confidence were found. Barriers included practical difficulties (finding essentials, reliable health information), social difficulties (loss of physical contact, decreased support), and uncertainty during pregnancy. Facilitators included support from others and for first-time parents, loss of childcare resulting in greater parenting confidence. While online resources and communication were not preferable to face-to-face interactions, technology was a helpful tool for communicating, getting support, and finding essentials and information during lockdown. Conclusion: By mid-May 2020, mood and parenting confidence among expectant and parents of newborns in the UK were significantly reduced. Consideration of barriers and facilitators in healthcare and psychological support provided is likely to play an important part in promoting parental mental health and healthy parent-child relationships.",Alejandra Perez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-20E-4D8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-20E-4D8,2020-10-11,2020-10-12T15:52:02+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Prenatal Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; covid-19; parental well-being; pandemic; pregnancy; infancy; parenting",False
44,Stigma towards Wuhan people during the COVID-19 epidemic: An exploratory study based on social media,"Background: Stigma associated with infectious diseases is common and causes various negative effects on stigmatized people. With Wuhan as the center of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, its people have become an object of stigmatization. To provide necessary information for stigma mitigation, this study aims to identify the stigmatizing attitudes towards Wuhan people and trace their changes as the COVID-19 progressed in China by analyzing related posts on social media. Methods: We collected a total of 19,780 Weibo posts containing the keyword ‘Wuhan people’ and performed a content analysis to identify stigmatizing attitudes in the posts. Then we divided our observation time into three periods and performed Repeated Measures ANOVA to compare the differences in attitudes in three periods. Results: Results show that stigma was mild with 2.46% of related posts being stigmatizing. The percentages of stigmatizing posts differed significantly in 3 periods (F (2,66) = 5.60, p <.01, η2= 0.15). The percentages of ‘Infectious’ posts (F (2,66) = 3.69, p <.05, η2 = 0.10) and ‘Stupid’ posts (F (2,66) = 3.65, p <.05, η2 = 0.10) are significantly different in 3 periods. The percentages of ‘Irresponsible’ posts is not significant different in 3 periods (F (2,66) = 0.63, p =.53, η2 = 0.02). After government interventions, stigma didn’t reduce significantly, and stigma with ‘Infectious’ attitude even increased. It was until the government interventions took effect that stigma significantly reduced. Conclusions: This study found that stigma towards Wuhan people included diverse attitudes and changed at different periods. After government interventions but before they took effect, stigma with ‘Infectious’ attitude increased. After government interventions took effect, general stigma, and stigma with ‘Infectious’ and ‘Stupid’ attitudes decreased. This study constitutes an important endeavor to understand the stigma towards Wuhan people in China during the COVID-19 epidemic.

45,The psychological wellbeing of frontline workers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: First and second wave findings from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study,"Background: Extant research relating to the psychological impact of infectious respiratory disease epidemics/pandemics suggests that frontline workers are particularly vulnerable. Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of ‘lockdown’ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 – 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%).

46,Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge).

48,Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales.

49,Gender Differences in Preventing the Spread of Coronavirus,"Social distancing and hygiene practices are key to preventing the spread of Coronavirus. However, people vary in the degree to which they follow these practices. Consistent with previous findings that women adhere more to preventative health practices, in Study 1, women reported engaging in preventative practices regarding COVID-19 (e.g., social distancing, hygiene) more so than men. In Study 2, across three different Northeast U.S. locations, we observed a greater percentage of women wearing masks in public than men. In Study 3, U.S. counties with a greater percentage of women exhibited a higher reduction in movement as tracked by ~17 million GPS smart-phone coordinates. These findings may partly explain the greater infection rates among men and suggest that preventive health messages should be tuned towards men.",Irmak Olcaysoy Okten et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46146-067-E3F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46146-067-E3F,2020-06-10,2020-10-11T21:45:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
50,State-level Stay-at-home Orders and Objectively Measured Movement in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: Social distancing has been one of the primary interventions used to slow the spread of COVID-19. State-wide stay-at-home orders received a large degree of attention as a public health intervention to increase social distancing, but relatively little peer-reviewed research has examined the extent to which stay-at-home orders affected people’s behavior. Method: This study used GPS-derived movement from 2,858 counties in the United States from March 1 to May 7, 2020 to test the degree to which changes in state-level stay-at-home orders were associated with movement outside the home. Results: From the first week of March to the first week of April, people in counties within states that enacted stay-at-home orders decreased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states that did not enact state-level stay-at-home orders. From the first week of April to the first week of May, people in counties within states that ended their stay-at-home orders increased their movement significantly more than people in counties within states whose stay-at-home orders remained in place. The magnitude of change in movement associated with state-level stay-at-home orders was many times smaller than the total change in movement across all counties over the same periods of time in both cases. Conclusions: Stay-at-home orders are likely insufficient to reduce people’s movement outside the home without additional public health actions. Existing research on behavior change would be useful to determine what additional interventions could support social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic if becomes necessary to reduce movement in the future.",Kyle J.

51,Perceived Risk and Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Resilience and Coronavirus Fear,"During coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were particularly at high-risk of developing symptoms of mental health problems due to being on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19. This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as critical mechanism that explain the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.",Murat Yıldırım et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B,2020-06-10,2020-10-11T21:42:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19 perceived risk; covid-19; resilience; mental health problems; healthcare professionals; covid-19 fear,False
52,National identity predicts public health support during a global pandemic,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating global health crisis. Without a vaccine or effective medication, the best hope for mitigating virus transmission is collective behavior change and support for public health interventions (e.g., physical distancing, physical hygiene, and endorsement of health policies). In a large-scale international collaboration (N = 46,450 across 67 countries), we investigated why people adopted public health behaviors and endorsed public policy interventions (e.g., closing bars and restaurants) during the early stages of the pandemic (April-May, 2020). Results revealed that respondents who identified more strongly with their nation consistently reported engagement in public health behaviors and greater support for public health policies. We also found a small effect of political orientation, indicating that left-wing respondents were more likely to report public health behaviors and support for public health measures than right-wing respondents. We discuss the implications of links between national identity, leadership, and public health for managing the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.",Jay Joseph Van Bavel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AA-DCA-3F0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AA-DCA-3F0,2020-09-02,2020-10-11T20:08:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; pandemic; covid-19; national identity; public health; human development,False
53,Preparing for a COVID-19 vaccine: Identifying and psychologically profiling those who are vaccine hesitant or resistant in two general population samples,"Successful delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine may be undermined if populations are not receptive to inoculation as a primary public health strategy for combatting the virus. We gathered nationally representative data from the general adult populations of Ireland (N=1,041) and the United Kingdom (UK; N=2,025) to determine rates of hesitancy and resistance to a future COVID-19 vaccine and to identify and psychologically profile vaccine hesitant/resistant individuals in a way that might aid future public health messaging. Vaccine hesitancy was evident for 26% and 25% of Irish and UK samples, respectively, while vaccine resistance was evident for 9% and 6%, respectively. Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed in relation to a number of sociodemographic, political, and health-related variables, but were similar across a broad array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those who were resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources. The current findings may help public health officials to more effectively target vaccine hesitant and resistant individuals, develop effective communication strategies that take into account their specific psychological dispositions, and leverage dissemination channels that can successfully reach these individuals.",Jamie Murphy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B9C-60B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B9C-60B,2020-06-10,2020-10-10T19:30:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; public health messaging; psychology; covid-19; vaccine,False
54,How the Affective Quality of Day-to-Day Social Connections May Contribute to Public Health: Prosocial Tendencies Account for the Links Between Positivity Resonance and Behaviors that Reduce the Spread of COVID-19,"Although simple behaviors such as handwashing, mask wearing and social distancing are known to limit viral spread, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, many individuals in the United States did not adopt them. The Positivity Resonance Theory of collective positive affect holds that shared pleasant states that include the key features of mutual care and a sense of oneness through behavioral synchrony, function to build self-transcendent prosocial tendencies (Fredrickson, 2016). We tested the theory-driven hypothesis that prosocial tendencies (e.g., positive, other-oriented dispositions of felt unity, empathy, altruism and general positivity toward humanity) are associated with high-quality day-to-day social connections characterized by the affective state of positivity resonance, and in turn account for simple behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. We measured positivity resonance at the level of social episodes either during (Study 1, N = 1059, April-May 2020) or before the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 2, N = 227, March-November 2019). Across both studies, results suggest that positivity resonance had a positive indirect effect on self-reported COVID-19-related hygienic (e.g., handwashing & mask-wearing) and charitable behaviors, which was mediated by a latent index of prosocial tendencies. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these mediation effects to be independent of overall positive and negative affect, the frequency of social interaction, political orientation, and concern for one’s own health. Effects for social distancing were mixed. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that positivity resonance, a subtype of collective positive affect, builds self-transcendent prosocial tendencies that motivate simple behaviors to protect community health.",Taylor Nicole West et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-9A6-321,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-9A6-321,2020-08-19,2020-10-10T14:37:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; affective science; social connection; prosocial; health behavior; covid-19; positive psychology,False
55,"Early life adversity, dispositional mindfulness, and longitudinal stress experience during the COVID-19 pandemic","Experiencing severe or prolonged stressors in early life is associated with increased risk for mental and physical disorders in adulthood. Further, individuals who experienced early life stress (ELS) may use dysfunctional coping strategies like stress-related eating, in contrast to more beneficial stress buffering mechanisms e.g. based on mindfulness. Whether these mechanisms contribute to increased levels of perceived stress and symptoms of mental disorders in individuals with ELS in times of crisis is yet unclear. As part of a larger project, we assessed changes in perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms in a sample of N=102 participants (81% female; meanage=23.49, SDage= 7.11, range 18–62) from October/December 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) to April/June 2020 (after the German government introduced Covid-19 related restrictions). Additionally, we assessed ELS and dispositional mindfulness. Perceived stress and depression significantly increased while anxiety levels decreased. No significant change was observed for somatization. ELS and dispositional mindfulness were not associated with change scores, but with perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms at both assessments. The increase in perceived stress during the pandemic in a majority of participants demonstrates the impact of the pandemic in the general population.",Annika Benz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-FB9-288,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-FB9-288,2020-08-06,2020-10-09T22:30:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; longitudinal data; anxiety; mental health; covid-19; depression; early life stress,False
56,Relationship Functioning During COVID-19 Quarantine,"Close relationships will play a crucial role in protecting health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, the pandemic and quarantines to contain COVID-19 present acute, ongoing demands that put couples at risk of relationship problems. The current research tested how (1) couples’ pre-existing vulnerabilities assessed prior to the pandemic (attachment insecurity) and (2) stress during a mandated quarantine predicted residual changes in relationship problems, satisfaction and commitment. When people experienced high levels of stress, greater own and partner attachment anxiety (assessed prior to the quarantine) predicted residual increases in relationship problems, and in turn, residual decreases in satisfaction and commitment (controlling for pre-quarantine problems, satisfaction and commitment). These vulnerability x stress patterns demonstrate that key models in relationship science can identify which couples are at most risk of relationship problems in the unprecedented context of a global pandemic and mandated quarantine.",Nickola Overall et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B4-14C-920,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B4-14C-920,2020-08-09,2020-10-09T22:28:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; stress; covid-19 quarantine; attachment insecurity; relationship problems,False
57,"Early adoption of face masks in Denmark during COVID-19: Assessing risk-compensation through psychological predictors, behavioral correlates and interrupted time-series analyses","A major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic has been whether the use of face masks leads to risk-compensation, i.e., generates false feelings of safety such that masks users relax other protective behaviors. Such concerns have, in particular, been prominent in countries where public use of face masks have not been traditionally recommended. In this paper, we assess the evidence for risk-compensation in such a country, Denmark, where the public use of face masks until recently was at a minimum. Using subsets of a large nationally representative collected at a daily basis (total N = 59,728), we demonstrate that face mask use is positively predicted by feelings of threat and negatively predicted by negative evaluations of the efficacy of the Danish health authorities general advice, suggesting masks are adopted as an additional layer of protection among those who feel threatened by COVID-19. Furthermore, we find that face mask use correlates positively with self-reported compliance with hygiene and distancing recommendations. However, people who use face masks also report higher infection-relevant contacts. This could suggest that people use face masks where they cannot keep a distance but can also be interpreted as risk-compensation, depending on the causal relationship between face mask use and contact behavior. To gauge causality, we use an interrupted time-series analyses to examine the effect of two changes in the Danish health authorities' policies on face mask use in public transportation. These changes, which occurred in response to rising infection numbers, lead to increased use and, importantly, increased rather than decreased compliance with other advice. These analyses suggest that in situations of rising infections national health authorities can recommend the use of face masks without concern for risk-compensation.",Marie Fly Lindholt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46043-021-141,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46043-021-141,2020-08-14,2020-10-09T22:26:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; covid-19; protective motivation theory; denmark; face masks; risk-compensation,False

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether meaning in life mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms and whether the mediating effect of meaning in life on depressive symptoms was moderated by optimism. The sample of the study included 475 undergraduate students attending a public university in an urban city of Turkey. They were 69.2% female, ranged in age between 18 and 34 years (M = 20.63, SD = 1.99). Results showed that meaning in life and optimism–pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Optimism also mediated the relationship between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, optimism moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life in the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. These results indicated that the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms can be better understood by meaning in life and optimism.

59,Wearing face masks strongly confuses counterparts in reading emotions,"Wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Although acceptance of such masks increases in the Western hemisphere, many people feel that social interaction is affected by wearing a mask. In the present experiment, we tested the impact of face masks on the readability of emotions. The participants (N=41, calculated by an a priori power test; random sample; healthy persons of different ages, 18-87 years) assessed the emotional expressions displayed by twelve different faces. Each face was randomly presented with six different expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad) while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. Lower accuracy and lower confidence in one’s own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. We further detected specific confusion patterns, mostly pronounced in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry plus assessing many other emotions (e.g. happy, sad and angry) as neutral. We discuss compensatory actions that can keep social interaction effective (e.g. body language, gesture and verbal communication), even when relevant visual information is crucially reduced.",Claus Christian Carbon,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EF-5C4-2FB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EF-5C4-2FB,2020-06-10,2020-10-09T16:29:58+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; occlusion; face; confusion; covid-19 pandemic; emotion; social psychology; accuracy; masks",False
60,"Knowledge, attitudes, and perception susceptibility towards the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin American region","BACKGROUND: Latin American countries have been strongly affected by COVID-19. Due to the alarming prevalence of cases, we set out to explore which psychosocial elements may be exerting an influence on the poor compliance with mandatory control measures among the population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and susceptibility perception of Latin American population during the coronavirus outbreak. METHOD: We collected data from 600 self-selected participants through a web-based cross-sectional survey evaluating demographic information. The respondents were between 16 to 77 years old. The majority of the participants were female (n= 382), graduated professionals (56.8 %), citizens living in any country in South America (72.2%). RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that knowledge is highly related with age (p=0.010*), attitude is related with marital status (p=0.017*), perception susceptibility is related with education (p=0.049*), marital status (p=0.001**) and occupation (p=0.001**). Our study identified that, although people reported adequate knowledge by identifying expected symptoms and coronavirus transmission process. There is a significant perceived susceptibility to contracting the mentioning virus (57.7%), displaying stigmatized behavior (59.1%), fear of contracting the virus from others (70.2%), and concern regarding serious consequences after the COVID-19 disease (72.3%). Additionally, we found that people distrust National Health administration's response (61.57%), preparedness for the disease (73.8%), and suggesting insufficient measures to deal with COVID-19 disease (61.3%). CONCLUSION: Within the framework of government regulations, it is suggested that guidelines be considered to expand strategies and provide reliable knowledge to facilitate positive attitudes towards protection measures against COVID-19. Communication strategies would serve both to contain psychological reactions and the perception of risk of contagion, as well as educational actions to ensure compliance with public control measures among the population.",Jonathan Zegarra-Valdivia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F3C-660,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F3C-660,2020-06-10,2020-10-09T16:28:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; public health; health communication; knowledge; attitudes; perception; primary prevention; covid-19,False
61,COVID Feel Good – An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus,"Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.",Giuseppe Riva et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE,2020-06-10,2020-10-09T16:27:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19,False
62,High trait self-control and low boredom proneness help COVID-19 homeschoolers,"In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) schools around the world have been closed to protect against the spread of coronavirus. In several countries, homeschooling has been introduced to replace classroom schooling. With a focus on individual differences, the present study examined 138 schoolers (age range = 6 to 21 years) regarding their self-control and boredom proneness. The results showed that both traits were important in predicting adherence to homeschooling. Schoolers with higher levels of self-control perceived homeschooling as less difficult, which in turn increased homeschooling adherence. In contrast, schoolers with higher levels of boredom proneness perceived homeschooling as more difficult, which in turn reduced homeschooling adherence. These results partially hold when it comes to studying in the classroom. However, boredom threatened adherence only in the homeschooling context. Our results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical construct to consider when educational systems switch to homeschooling during a pandemic.",Corinna Martarelli et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A2-A1B-F9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A2-A1B-F9D,2020-08-12,2020-10-09T16:26:24+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology,False
63,Regional Personality Predicts the Early Spread of COVID-19 and Social Distancing Behavior,"Social behaviors play a key role in the spread of COVID-19. Consequently, regional variation in personality traits that capture individual differences in these social behaviors may offer new insight into regional variation in COVID-19 cases. Here we combine self-reported personality data (N ≈ 3.5 million people), official COVID-19 prevalence rates, and behavioral observations (N ≈ 29 million people) to show that regional personality differences in the US and Germany predict the regional onset and growth of COVID-19 cases above and beyond a highly conservative set of socio-demographic, socio-economic, and pandemic-related control variables. Openness and Extraversion were consistently related to earlier COVID-19 onsets and steeper growth rates. The opposite pattern was found for Neuroticism. We also shed light on regional responses to the outbreak, showing that regional personality (i) is associated with objective indicators of regional social distancing, and (ii) predicts self-reported social distancing beyond the effects of individual-level personality.",Heinrich Peters et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-F45-EB8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-F45-EB8,2020-08-06,2020-10-09T16:25:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; regional personality; big five; social distancing; covid-19,False

65,Pandemic buying: Testing a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying using data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Over-purchasing and hoarding of necessities is a common response to crises, especially in developed economies where there is normally an expectation of plentiful supply. This behaviour was observed internationally early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of actual scarcity, this behaviour can be described as ‘panic buying’ and can lead to temporary shortages. However, there have been few psychological studies of this phenomenon. We propose a psychological model of over-purchasing informed by animal foraging theory and make predictions about variables that predict over-purchasing by either exacerbating or mitigating the anticipation of future scarcity. These variables include additional scarcity cues (e.g. loss of income), distress (e.g. depression), psychological factors that draw attention to these cues (e.g. neuroticism) or to reassuring messages (eg. analytical reasoning) or which facilitate over-purchasing (e.g. income). We tested our model in parallel nationally representative internet surveys of the adult general population conducted in the United Kingdom (UK: N = 2025) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI: N = 1041) 52 and 31 days after the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the UK and RoI, respectively. About three quarters of participants reported no or very little over-purchasing. More over-purchasing in RoI may have reflected different government messaging or historical factors. When over-purchasing occurred, it was observed across a wide range of product categories and was accounted for by a single latent factor. It was positively predicted by household income, the presence of children at home, psychological distress (depression, death anxiety), threat sensitivity (right wing authoritarianism) and mistrust of others (paranoia).

66,Structuring of Time is Key for Job Performance and Well-being: The Case of Croatians Working from Home During COVID-19 Pandemic,"In this research, we aimed to explore determinants of job performance and well-being while working from home (WFH) in a specific context of mandatory WFH during COVID-19 lockdown in Croatia, a country where WFH is a highly unusual arrangement. In Study 1, on a nationally representative sample of 166 Croatian employees WFH during lockdown, we tested if aspects of work-life balance (WLB) – work-to-family and family-to-work conflict, time structure of the work day and psychological detachment from work – would predict job performance and well-being. We showed that of the four WLB aspects, only time structure was important both for job performance and well-being. In Study 2, we used a convenient sample of 575 Croatian employees who were WFH during lockdown to investigate conscientiousness, emotional stability and autonomy at work as drivers of the WLB during WFH, and to constructively replicate Study 1 findings using different and more advanced measures. Findings showed that autonomy, conscientiousness and, especially, emotional stability contributed to the WLB and were important for job performance and well-being. WLB, especially time structure, predicted both job performance and well-being, and enhanced time structure mediated the effects of personality traits and autonomy on both outcomes.",Mitja Ružojčić et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CB-AF3-454,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CB-AF3-454,2020-10-08,2020-10-09T12:42:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Balance; work from home; personality; coronavirus; work and organizational psychology; autonomy; work-life balance; croatia; occupational health psychology; covid-19,False
67,"PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND SOCIAL PAIN DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC-RELATED SOCIAL ISOLATION","The recognition and management of the socio-emotional pain facing the COVID-19 pandemic refer to different, but interdependent, clues regarding cognitive and emotional aspects of the pandemic threat, considering the need of social distancing as a prophylactic procedure to avoid spreading the pathogen. The socio-emotional condition at the time of outbreak subsidizes the (re)modulation of interactive neural circuits underlying the risk assessment behaviour at physical, emotional, and social levels. Experiences of social isolation, exclusion or affective loss are generally considered to be some of the most “painful” things that people face. The threats of social disconnection are processed by some of the same neural structures that process basic threats to survival. The lack of social connection can be ""painful"" due to an overlap in the neural circuitry responsible for both physical and emotional pain related to feelings of social rejection. Indeed, many of us go to great lengths to avoid situations that may engender these experiences. Because of this, this work focusses on times of pandemic, the somatization mentioned above seeks the interconnection and/or interdependence between neural systems related to emotional and cognitive processes, so that the person involved in that aversive social environment becomes aware of himself, the others, and the threatening situation experienced to avoid daily psychological and neuropsychiatric effects. Social distancing during the isolation evokes the formation of social distress, raising the intensity of learned fear that people acquire, consequently enhancing the emotional and social pain.",Priscila De Medeiros et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-C53-D16,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-C53-D16,2020-09-20,2020-10-09T12:00:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Systems Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; physical pain; covid-19; covid-19.; neurosciences; social distancing; emotional pain; social pain,False
68,COVID-19 CONSPIRACY BELIEFS AND CONTAINMENT-RELATED BEHAVIOUR: THE ROLE OF POLITICAL TRUST,"The roles of conspiracy beliefs and political trust for public health behaviour have been seldomly studied prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect containment-related behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic, and whether this relationship is mediated by political trust, preference for saving economy or for saving lives. The data were collected at two time points, at the beginning of the epidemic and after the state of emergency was introduced. The sample consisted of 802 adults from Serbia (356 at time 1 and 446 at time 2), of which around 60% female, with the mean age of around 33. The results indicate that holding more conspiracy beliefs is related to less adherence to containment-related behaviour, both directly and indirectly, via decreased political trust. Preference for saving lives has a direct effect on containment-related behaviour, while preference for saving economy plays no important role in this relationship, although it has a negative zero-order association with containment-related behaviour. The findings are interpreted in the light of the importance of governmental epidemic management for containing, i.e. preventing the spread of infectious diseases.",Tijana Karić et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46128-44E-EE5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46128-44E-EE5,2020-10-09,2020-10-09T11:24:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; saving the economy; pandemic; covid-19; political trust; conspiracy beliefs; containment-related behaviour,False
69,"Mode and Frequency of Covid-19 Information Updates, Political Values, and Future Covid-19 Vaccine Attitudes","The effect of social media consumption on perceptions of the seriousness of the Covid-19 pandemic, attitudes to public health requirements, and intentions towards a future Covid-19 vaccine are of live public health interest. There are also public health and security concerns that the pandemic has been accompanied and arguably further amplified by an ‘infodemic’ spreading misinformation. Tests of the effect of social media consumption on future Covid-19 vaccine intentions using population samples have been relatively few to date. This study contributes to the evidence base by examining social media consumption and vaccine intentions using British and US population samples. Methods: Data were gathered on 1,663 GB adults and 1,198 US adults from an online panel on attitudes towards a future vaccine alongside self-reported social and legacy broadcast and print media consumption. Ordered and binomial logit models were used to assess reported intentions regarding a future Covid-19 vaccine, testing the effects of media consumption type. Respondents were categorised in terms of their media consumption using a fourfold typology, as less frequent social, less frequent legacy media consumers (low-low); high social, low legacy media consumers (high-low); low social, high legacy (low-high); and high social, high legacy (high-high). Results: In the British sample, regression results indicate that those who receive Covid-19 updates more frequently via legacy media (low-high), and those being updated more than daily via both online and legacy media consumers, tend to provide significantly less Covid-19 vaccine-hesitant responses than low-low consumers. There is no significant difference between high social, low legacy media consumers and low-low consumers. In the US sample, membership of the low-high group is associated with lower Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy compared with low-low consumers. However, respondents consuming both social and legacy media several times daily exhibit similar vaccine intentions on average to those consuming social media daily and legacy media less often, providing a contrast with the UK sample. We also identify differences in Covid-19 vaccine intentions relating to demographics and political values. Conclusions: Differences in vaccine attentions are associated with the extent and balance of consumption of news relating to Covid-19 and its source. Political values and ethnic identity also appear to structure attitudes to a future Covid-19 vaccine.",Siobhan Mcandrew et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-240-B51,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-240-B51,2020-08-14,2020-10-09T11:20:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; conspiracism; vaccine attitudes; legacy media; vaccine hesitancy; covid-19; political values; social media,False
70,"The Hazardous Workplace, Work-related Stress, and Unhealthy Behaviors among Healthcare Workers: The Relationships with Depressive and Insomnia symptoms during COVID-19","We aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors among healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers’ consideration of their work unit as hazardous. Furthermore, workers’ depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Healthcare workers’ work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic - 9 (SAVE-9) scale. As a result, work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was related to being female, to regarding one's work as a dangerous workplace, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were related to being male, young, experiencing depression, and having insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to closely observe the patterns of work-related stress and anxiety reactions among healthcare workers to reduce their burnout.",Ju Kab Lee et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-70E-E8B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-70E-E8B,2020-10-07,2020-10-09T01:28:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; health personnel; covid-19; save-9; occupational stress,False
71,Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology,"Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.",Asle Hoffart et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277,2020-06-10,2020-10-08T23:25:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety,False
72,Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants (N =14,393; Observations =48,486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June, 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score ≥3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April, 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%), 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April, 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI [14.3%-22.9%]), followed by females and high income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June, 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. Conclusions This study suggests that a pronounced and prolonged deterioration in mental health occurred as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the UK between April and June, 2020.",Michael Daly et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-538-ECB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-538-ECB,2020-06-10,2020-10-08T22:24:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; psychological distress; mental health; representative study; coronavirus; covid-19; public health; longitudinal,False

A total of 964 school professionals (90.7% teachers; 9.3% school counsellors) participated in the study.

76,Of Pathogens and Party Lines: Social Conservatism Positively Associates with COVID-19 Precautions among Democrats but not Republicans,"Consistent with a threat-bias model of ideological differences, social liberals have been shown to be less pathogen-avoidant than tradition-valuing social conservatives. However, particularly when pathogen threat occurs at a societal level, additional factors may influence individual responses. In the current pandemic, the more socially conservative U.S. political party has consistently downplayed the dangers of COVID-19. This creates a natural experiment, allowing examination of the contributions of multiple factors to disease avoidance. We investigated the relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautionary behavior in light of the partisan landscape, exploring whether consumption of, and attitudes toward, different sources of information, as well as differential evaluation of various threats caused by the pandemic—such as direct health costs versus indirect harms to the economy and individual liberties—shape political differences in responses to the pandemic in ways that mask the contributions of social conservatism. In two studies, socially conservative attitudes correlate with self-reported COVID-19 prophylactic behaviors, but only among Democrats. Reflecting larger societal divisions, among Republicans and Independents, the positive relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautions is jointly suppressed by lower trust in scientists, lower trust in liberal and moderate sources, lesser consumption of liberal news media, and greater economic conservatism.",Theodore Samore et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46112-9E1-F5C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46112-9E1-F5C,2020-08-08,2020-10-08T03:15:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; political differences; pathogen avoidance; covid-19; social conservatism; traditionalism,False
77,Prosocial behavior promotes positive emotion during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant threat to humans’ physical and mental wellbeing. In response, there has been an urgent “call to action” for psychological interventions that enhance positive emotion and psychological resilience. Extending upon past research documenting the wellbeing benefits of generous action, we conducted two online pre-registered experiments (N =1,623) during the pandemic in which participants were randomly assigned to engage in other- or self-beneficial action. Specifically, participants made charitable donations or gained money for themselves (Experiment 1); purchased COVID-19-related or COVID-19-unrelated items for someone else or for themselves (Experiment 2). Results showed that prosocial behavior led to greater positive affect, meaningfulness, empathy and social connectedness. Affect benefits were detectable whether prosocial spending was COVID-19-related or not.

78,Social Distancing in America: Understanding Long-term Adherence to Covid-19 Mitigation Recommendations,"In the period from May to July, the United States repealed statewide and local lockdown measures, reopened society, and became the global leader in reported infections and deaths from the coronavirus COVID-19. During this timeframe, the country saw some of the largest civil rights protests in United States history, and increasing politicization of the pandemic leading up to the Presidential elections. Throughout these events, social distancing recommendations have remained in force. However, social distancing was no longer the focus of the public health response, and was largely overshadowed by face masks – despite evidence of its effectiveness for reducing virus transmission. This study examines to what extent Americans have continued to adhere to social distancing measures across these developments, and which factors sustained adherence. Our findings, based on three waves of nationally representative and cross-sectional studies conducted in May, June, and July, show that adherence to social distancing measures declined from May to July, as did knowledge of these measures, citizens’ practical capacity to adhere to them, and the social norms for adherence. At the same time, opportunities to violate these measures have increased. However, adherence levels stabilized in July, and support for social distancing measures among Americans has remained high throughout. These findings provide important insight into what motivated Americans to adhere to social distancing measures when distancing ceased to be the focus of the public health response. It thereby identifies important directions through which public health policy could sustain or promote adherence to mitigation measures in the United States.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620F-583-148,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620F-583-148,2020-10-07,2020-10-08T02:25:06+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; george floyd; opportunity; trust in media; social distancing; health behaviors; social norms; compliance; obligation to obey the law; black lives matter; procedural justice; threat perceptions; emotions; political orientation; covid-19; capacity; united states of america; trust in science; adherence; impulsivity; public health; partisanship; deterrence",False
79,Karantzas et al. (2020) COVID-19 Relationship Wellbeing & Loneliness,"It has been assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted parental and family relationships due to issues including economic problems, strains of home confinement and social isolation. Despite these assumptions, there has been little research to date investigating the impact of COVID-19 stressors on parents’ relationship wellbeing and loneliness. Hence, there is an insufficient evidence base with which to guide policy or action in this most critical arena. The current study reports data from a large national representative sample (N=1,829) of Australian parents, surveyed during the early phases of the COVID-19 lockdown. Drawing on widely studied relationship models of vulnerability-stress and stress-buffering, Structural Equation Models (SEM) were derived to test the extent that COVID-19 stressors, personal vulnerabilities (mental health problems, attachment insecurity), relationship adaptation processes (constructive communication, partner support), and the interactions between these variables, predicted relationship quality and loneliness. After controlling for pre-pandemic stressors, relationship adaptations buffered the negative effects of COVID-19 stressors and personal vulnerabilities on relationship quality and loneliness. The findings provide support for a model of stress-buffering over a model of vulnerability-stress.

80,Refuting Spurious COVID-19 Treatment Claims Reduces Demand and Misinformation Sharing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of health misinformation, which has had serious consequences including direct harm and opportunity costs. We investigated (N = 678) the impact of such misinformation on two behavioral measures, viz. demand (i.e., willingness-to-pay) for a spurious treatment, and propensity to promote (i.e., like or share) misinformation online. This is a novel approach, as previous research has used mainly questionnaire-based measures. We also compared two interventions to counteract the misinformation, viz. a tentative refutation based on materials used by health authorities, and an enhanced refutation based on best-practice recommendations. We found prior exposure to misinformation increased misinformation promotion (by 18%). Both tentative and enhanced refutations reduced demand (by 18% and 25%, respectively) as well as misinformation promotion (by 29% and 55%).

In this research, we assessed if fan responses to the suspension and the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with different types of fan passion and motives. Shortly after the NBA season suspension, NBA fans (N = 395) completed online surveys assessing harmonious and obsessive passion for being an NBA fan, motives for watching games, and various attitudes and responses to the suspension and COVID-19. We found that both fan passion and motives predicted responses to the suspension and COVID-19, particularly obsessive passion which predicted greater levels of distress, coping responses, and negative attitudes toward both the suspension and COVID-19.

82,"You, Me, and No One Else: Degree of Social Distancing and Personality Predict Psychological Wellness and Relationship Quality During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While incredibly disruptive to everyday life, the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study the influence of social distancing and quarantine behaviors on mental health and relationship quality. In this study, we used a snowball sample of 519 Americans to examine whether there were relationships between personality, degree of adherence to social distancing and quarantining norms and regulations, and psychological wellness and relationship quality.

83,Regulatory Focus and Perceived Security with Casual Partners: Implications for Sexual Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Fundamental motives for survival help people regulate their goal pursuit, by shaping perceptions, feelings and actions. Motives for security (i.e., prevention focus) are associated with risk awareness and risk avoidance, whereas motives for pleasure (i.e., promotion focus) are associated with risk taking. Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, survival needs and health risks are particularly salient. Hence, people focused on prevention (vs. promotion) should be more aware of health risks, more careful in their sexual behaviors, and less likely to take sexual health risks with casual partners. However, feeling safer with casual partners might mitigate some of the risks associated with sexual behaviors during this pandemic. Methods: We administered an online survey in English, Spanish and German to 550 single participants (57.6% women; Mage = 24.72, SD = 5.75). Results: Prevention focused participants were less fearful of COVID-19 infection, perceived to be better informed, and retrieved their information from scientific sources. They were also less likely to have condomless sex with casual partners, regardless how safe they perceived to be with them. Promotion focused participants were more fearful of COVID-19 infection and perceived to be better informed, but retrieved their information from non-scientific sources. They were more willing to have sex with casual partners, and more likely to consider having condomless oral sex, but only if they felt safer (vs. less safe) with their casual partners Conclusions: Our findings show the importance of individual motivations and interpersonal dynamics for risk perception and sexual health behaviors.",David L.

84,Personal and Relational Outcomes of Online Pornography Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced the world into social isolation and confinement for health and safety reasons. Such changes affected the way people connect with each other, which had repercussions on health and well-being. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, researchers have been striving to understand the effects of the pandemic at social, personal and relational levels. Some people have experienced heightened sexual desire and made new additions to their sexual repertoire. We extended these findings by examining the personal and relational outcomes of joint and solitary online pornography use. Results from a cross-sectional study (N = 301 participants; 56.5% men; Mage = 31.36, SD = 10.57) showed that participants indicated adherence to confinement policies, changes in lifestyle, and fear of becoming infected with COVID-19. Participants also indicated decreased sexual desire since the outbreak, but also increased willingness to have sex. Results also showed that joint pornography use was associated with more sex quality and more satisfaction and intimacy with their partners, which in turn was associated with better perceived physical health and better sleep quality. The reverse pattern was found for solitary pornography use. Lastly, overall results were consistent for single and pattered people. These findings show the personal and relational benefits of using online pornography with partners use during the pandemic.",David L.

85,Personality Traits and Narccissism as Predictors of Pathological Selfie Among University Undergraduates in Nigeria,"This study examined personality traits and narcissistic as predictors of pathological selfie among undergraduates of university of Ilorin. An ex post-facto design using survey method was adopted while three hundred respondents (110 males and 190 females), participated in the study. Their age ranged from 16 years to 35years. A questionnaire pack which included-the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-16 (NPI-16); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and Selfie Behaviour Scale (SBS) was utilized. The results of t-test revealed that gender do not significantly influence pathological selfies (t=.763; df= 298; p>.05). However, there was a significant difference in the participants type of phones on selfie pathology (t (120)=-3.01, p<.05); respondents with smart phones (M=56.89, SD=10.25) significantly reported higher scores on pathological selfies compare to respondents with non-smart phones (M=53.23, SD=9.75). Multiple regression result showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism and narcissism jointly predicted pathological selfies (R=.49; R2=.29; F(6, 293)=15.09; p<.01). However, extraversion (β =.20; t =2.91; p<.05); agreeableness (β= -.29; t =-4.03; p<.01) conscientiousness (β=.24; t=3.90; p<.01); neuroticism (β = .19; t=3.91; p<.05) and narcissism (β=.22; t =3.91; p<.05) had independent significant prediction of pathological selfies.

86,The Psychology and Political Orientation of Social Distancing Compliance and Attitude toward Mask-Wearing during the COVID-19 Outbreak in the U.S.,"In the United States, while the number of coronavirus case has kept increasing, the practice of social distancing and mask-wearing have been controversial and even politicized. The present study aimed to examine the role of psychological traits and political orientation in social distancing compliance and attitude toward mask-wearing. A sample of 233 U.S. adult residents were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants completed scales of social distancing compliance, attitude toward mask-wearing, need for cognition, self-control, risk preference, and political orientation. For each participant, epidemiological information (seven-day positive rate and the number of cases per 100,000) was obtained based on the state she/he resided in. As a result, there was no significant relationship between the epidemiological information and social distancing compliance or attitude toward mask-wearing. Instead, those who had a higher level of need for cognition, self-control, or risk averse were more positive on social distancing compliance and mask-wearing. Additionally, the study found political orientation was a significant factor, with a more liberal tendency being associated with more positive on social distancing compliance and mask-wearing. For mask-wearing, an interaction was also found between need for cognition and political orientation such that the effect of need for cognition was stronger in the more liberal participants than in the more conservative participants. Collectively, the study revealed the psychological and political roots of social distancing and mask-wearing compliance. Policy implications are discussed.",Jiuqing Cheng,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621C-078-521,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621C-078-521,2020-08-14,2020-10-05T21:57:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; mask wearing; need for cognition; social distancing; self-control; political orientation; covid-19; risk preference,False
87,Ideological responses to the breaking of COVID-19 social distancing recommendations,"COVID-19 has plagued the globe since January 2020, infecting millions and claiming the lives of several hundreds of thousands (at the time of writing). Despite this, many individuals have ignored public health guidance and continued to socialize in groups. Emergent work has highlighted the potential role that ideology plays in such behavior, and judgements of it. In response to this contemporary cultural phenomenon, we tested whether judgements of those allegedly flouting the guidance on social distancing were influenced by an interaction between the ideologies of those providing judgements, and those allegedly breaking the rules. Our data suggest that judgements of those flouting social distancing guidance are influenced by ideology in a symmetrical way. That is, both liberals and conservatives condemn outgroup flouting more than ingroup flouting. We discuss this finding in the context of theoretical work into ideological symmetries, and the implications of growing ideological polarization in contemporary Western democracies.",Craig A.

88,Analysis System for Emotional Behavior in Football (ASEB-F): Professional football players' emotional behavior in ghost games in the Austrian Bundesliga. Draft version 1 05-08-2020,"Introduction. During the Covid-19 pandemic the “Austrian Bundesliga” - as many other European football leagues - resumed the season around the end of May 2020 without supporters in the stadiums. These so-called “ghost games” represent a unique opportunity to study the effects of the (missing) audience on the behavior and experience of sports professionals. Methods. We used our newly developed “Analysis System for Emotional Behavior in Football” (ASEB-F) and video-analyzed - in sum - 20 games of FC Red Bull Salzburg in the “Championship Groups” of season 2018/19 (“regular games”) and season 2019/20 (“ghost games”) and compared the behavior of players, staff and officials. Additionally, we contrasted the seasons based on official matchday statistics. Results. There were 19.5% fewer emotional situations in “ghost games” than in “regular games”. Data shows the number of emotional behaviors “Self-Adaptor” (+0.8%), “Protest” (+4.2%) and “Fair-Play-Behavior” (+3.1%) increased in “ghost games”, whereas “Words fight” (-5.1%) and “Discussion” (-5.1%) decreased in “ghost games”. In “regular games” referees were actively involved in 39.4% of all documented emotional situations, whereas in “ghost games” referees were actively involved in only 25.2% of all documented emotional situations (-14.2%). Chronological analysis within games - from kick-on to kick-off - further shows substantial differences in occurrences of emotional behavior between “regular games” and “ghost games”. Conclusion. The present study provides unprecedented insights into the effects of missing supporters in the football games during the Covid-19 pandemic on emotional behavior on the pitch. In addition, our study shows novel and largely unexpected effects on actual playing time and on the home (dis)advantage. From a sport psychological perspective, we argue that the evidence from our “ghost games” study indicates that the absence of supporters has a substantial influence on the experience and behavior of players, staff and officials alike.",Michael Christian Leitner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-9D2-64E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-9D2-64E,2020-08-05,2020-10-05T18:33:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Nonverbal Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; nonverbal behavior; sport psychology; covid-19; human behavior; referees; sports performance; home advantage; soccer; no supporters; no crowd; football; ghost games,False
89,"Scientific Trust, Risk Assessment, and Conspiracy Beliefs about COVID-19 - Four Patterns of Consensus and Disagreement between Scientific Experts and the German Public","We investigated laypersons’ agreement with technical claims about the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus and with claims about the risk from COVID-19 in the general public in Germany (N = 1,575) and compared these with the evaluations of scientific experts (N = 128). Using Latent Class Analysis, we distinguished four segments in the general public. Two groups (mainstream and cautious, 73%) are generally consistent with scientific experts in their evaluations. Two groups (doubters and deniers, 27%) differ distinctively from expert evaluations and tend to believe in conspiracies about COVID-19. Deniers (8%) are characterized by low risk assessments, anti-elitist sentiments and low compliance with containment measures. Doubters (19%) are characterized by general uncertainty in the distinction between true and false claims and by low scientific literacy in terms of cognitive ability and style.

90,We distance most when we believe our social circle does,"Why do we adopt new rules, such as social distancing? While decades of psychology research stresses the importance of social influence on individual behaviour, many COVID-19 campaigns focused on convincing individuals that distancing is the right thing to do. In a global dataset (114 countries, n=6674), we investigated how social influences predict people’s adherence to distancing rules during the pandemic. Analyses showed that people practised distancing more when they thought their close social circle did so; this social influence mattered more than people thinking distancing was the right thing. People’s adherence also aligned with their fellow citizens’, but only if they deeply bonded with their country. Personal vulnerability to the disease predicted distancing more for people with larger social circles. Empathy, collective efficacy and collectivism also significantly predicted distancing. During crises, policymakers can achieve behavioural change by emphasising shared values and harnessing the social influence of close friends and relatives.",Bahar Tuncgenc et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BB-20C-036,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BB-20C-036,2020-08-05,2020-10-05T18:29:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; vulnerability; covid-19; identity fusion; social closeness; social distancing; norm change,False

92,"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences and somatic symptoms","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, populations from many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidenced deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was unidirectional since daytime reports of negative mental experiences were not associated with poor sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement",Peter Simor et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-9FB-D9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-9FB-D9D,2020-08-07,2020-10-05T18:14:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; coronavirus; psychotic-like; somatic symptoms; sleep; rumination; stress,False
93,Building an Emotion Regulation Recommender Algorithm for Socially Anxious Individuals Using Contextual Bandits,"Objectives: Poor emotion regulation (ER) has been implicated in many mental illnesses, including social anxiety disorder. To work towards a scalable, low-cost intervention for improving ER, we developed a novel contextual recommender algorithm for ER strategies. Design: N=114 socially anxious participants were prompted via a mobile app up to six times daily for five weeks to report their emotional state, use of 19 different ER strategies (or no strategy), physical location, and social context. Information from passive sensors was also collected. Methods: Given the large number of ER strategies, we used two different approaches for variable reduction: (1) grouping ER strategies into categories based on a prior meta-analysis, and (2) considering only the ten most frequently used strategies. For each approach, an algorithm that recommends strategies based on one’s current context was compared to an algorithm that recommends ER strategies randomly, an algorithm that always recommends cognitive reappraisal, and the person’s observed ER strategy use. Contextual bandits were used to predict the effectiveness of the strategies recommended by each policy. Results: When strategies were grouped into categories, the contextual algorithm was not the best performing policy. However, when the top ten strategies were considered individually, the contextual algorithm outperformed all other policies. Conclusions: Grouping strategies into categories may obscure differences in their contextual effectiveness. Further, using strategies tailored to context is more effective than using cognitive reappraisal indiscriminately across all contexts. Future directions include deploying the contextual recommender algorithm as part of a just-in-time intervention to assess real-world efficacy.",Miranda Leigh Beltzer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46103-40B-76E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46103-40B-76E,2020-10-05,2020-10-05T17:30:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; emotion regulation; contextual bandits; social anxiety; ecological momentary assessment; recommender algorithm,False
94,Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic reflect the dual evolutionary foundations of political ideology,"A popular view, supported by several studies, is that liberals are more concerned than conservatives about COVID-19. This is puzzling given the strong pandemic responses from some conservative nations, and the well-established link between conservatism and threat-sensitivity. We argue a resolution is provided by the dual evolutionary foundations of political ideology, which track trade-offs between: (1) threat-driven group conformity (social conservatism or right-wing authoritarianism [RWA]) vs. individual autonomy (social progressivism); and (2) a competitive motivation for hierarchy (economic conservatism or social dominance orientation [SDO]) vs. cooperation (economic progressivism). Using longitudinal data from a UK sample (n=433), we show that social (RWA), but not economic (SDO), conservatism significantly increased following the pandemic, and self-reported worry about the pandemic predicts this effect. Moreover, both social conservatives and economic progressives display strong responses to COVID-19, but for different reasons. While social conservatives generally display more worried and conformist/norm-enforcing responses, economic progressives display more cooperative, empathic responses and only worried or conformist/norm-enforcing responses related to empathy. These findings provide an explanation for apparently inconsistent results of prior work, support the dual foundations model of political ideology, and offer insight into divergent motives across the ideological landscape that may be useful for managing pandemic response.",Kyle Fischer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-C5E-F97,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-C5E-F97,2020-10-05,2020-10-05T13:17:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution|Reciprocity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution|Survival and Psychological Adaptations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; conservatism; social dominance orientation; cooperation; longitudinal; covid-19 pandemic; norm enforcement; empathy; authoritarianism; political ideology,False
95,How did COVID-19 Impact the Lives and Perceived Well-being of Parents? Using the Case of Singapore to Investigate the Mechanisms,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents a significant challenge to the lives and well-being of families with underaged children. Although previous studies have documented COVID-related deterioration in well-being and identified protective and risk factors, the mechanisms under which the pandemic leads to worsened well-being remain unclear. In addition, from a policymaker’s perspective, it is important to differentiate between the effects of government-issued infection control measures (such as lockdown) and families’ voluntary responses when facing the coronavirus (such as self-quarantine) on well-being. Using Singapore as an example, we collected retrospective self-reports on the everyday activities, stressors, and well-being of parents and other caregivers at three timepoints: before local transmission (Pre-pandemic), after local transmission but before the “circuit breaker” (Pandemic), and during the “circuit breaker” (Lockdown). We estimated the effects of the pandemic itself and families’ voluntary responses to it by contrasting Pandemic against Pre-pandemic, and we estimated the additional effects of imposed lockdown measures by contrasting Lockdown against Pandemic. Results showed significant changes in jobs and income, childcare arrangement, family dynamics, and parents’ emotional well-being throughout the three timepoints. Both mothers and fathers reported to worry most about the health and safety of family members and self. Mothers’ time spent on housework partially mediated the effect of lockdown on their emotional well-being, and parents’ conflict with other adults in the household partially mediated the effects of both pandemic and lockdown on their emotional well-being. The effects of pandemic and lockdown were also moderated by parents’ age, education level, and fathers’ authoritarian values.",Yang Yang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46078-BA4-0F5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46078-BA4-0F5,2020-10-05,2020-10-05T12:28:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; singapore; family dynamics; authoritarian values; emotional well-being; covid-19; lockdown,False
96,What influences people’s responses to public health messages for managing risks and preventing infectious diseases? A rapid systematic review of the evidence and recommendations,"Background Population level behaviour change, requiring individual behaviour change such as hand hygiene and physical distancing, are central to reducing transmission of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, but little is known about how best to communicate this type of risk reducing information, and how populations might respond. We conducted a rapid systematic review to identify and synthesise evidence relating to: a) What characterises effective public-health messages for managing risk and preventing infectious disease, and b) What influences people’s responses to public-health messages. Methods Rapid systematic review methodology was used. We included all study designs and grey literature. Non-English language papers were excluded. Ovid Medline, Ovid PsycINFO and Healthevidence.org were searched alongside PsyarXiv and OSF Preprints up to May 2020. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Findings We identified 70 eligible papers: 3 systematic reviews, 54 individual papers and 14 pre-prints. To influence behaviour effectively at the population level, public-health messages need to be acceptable, credible and trustworthy, to increase the public’s understanding and perceptions of the threat. Interpretation Key recommendations are to: engage communities in the development of public-health messaging, use credible and legitimate sources, address uncertainty immediately and with transparency, focus on unifying messages from all sources, and develop messages aimed at increasing understanding, induce social responsibility and empower personal control. Embedding these principles of behavioural science into public-health messaging is an important step towards more effective health-risk communication for managing risk, promoting protective behaviours and preventing disease during epidemics/pandemics.",Daniela Ghio et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-445-5C8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-445-5C8,2020-07-13,2020-10-05T09:41:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
97,COVID-19 health and social care access for autistic people and individuals with intellectual disability: A European policy review.,"Background: The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some groups, including autistic people/ those with intellectual disability (ID), may become excluded from services. Methods: We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published March-July 2020, pertaining to: 1) accessibility of COVID-19 testing; 2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICU); and 3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1,301 autistic people and caregivers. Results: Autistic people/ those with ID experienced significant barriers accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite these groups being at elevated risk for severe illness due to co-morbid health conditions, there was a lack of access to COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible - predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Last, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has further emphasised healthcare inequalities for autistic people/ those with ID, likely contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality in these groups. Current policies and guidelines regarding the accessibility of COVID-19 services require urgent revision to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people and those with ID from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.",Bethany Oakley et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-ECA-0D7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-ECA-0D7,2020-10-02,2020-10-05T08:49:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,False
98,"Sources of information, trust, and protective health behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic: A UAE cross-sectional study","The present study has two aims (1) to identify the type of sources of information mostly used to obtain information about COVID-19 and the level of trust in those sources according to sociodemographic variables in the context of the COVID-19 in UAE and (2) to explore if the level of trust on sources of information, and citizenship are predictors of the adoption of protective behaviors to reduce the risk of being infected, considering age, gender and education as covariates. Participants (N = 1585) were recruited in April 2020 via announcements in the UAE media and through email networks. The findings indicated that the most used sources were Websites, social media, government sources, and family and friends. The sources considered more trustworthy were personal doctors, health care professionals, and government. There were differences in the use of sources and levels of trust according to age, gender, and education. Concerning the adoption of protective behaviors, there were no gender differences; however, age, education, and citizenship were significant, younger groups reported lower scores on protective behaviors, and higher educated participants reported higher adoption of protective behavior. National citizens reported lower scores on the adoption of protective behavior. The level of trust in sources of information and citizenship were predictors of the adoption of protective behavior. The use of sources of information and the level of trust vary from traditional to newly-developed sources, which can influence the adoption of protective behaviors for COVID-19. The findings suggest that the COVID-19-related contents need to be adjusted to different types of medium, considering the characteristics of the population and culture, to ensure that it is helping individuals to understand risks and develop their knowledge and skills to face the pandemic by adopting protective behaviors.",Maria J.

99,How communication technology helps mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individual and social wellbeing: Preliminary support for a compensatory social interaction model,"The present study preliminary tested the compensatory social interaction model for individuals experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. This original model comprises two distinct processes: expression of online emotions leads to post-traumatic growth, which can favor positive mental health and prosocial behaviors; and receiving online social support leads to increases in positive mental health, which can also favor prosocial behaviors. Adults living in Italy (n=1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed that being more involved in expression of online emotions was associated with higher post-traumatic growth that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, participants who perceived higher online social support were more likely to report higher positive mental health that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two social interaction processes suggest that communication technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the Covid-19 pandemic.",Natale Canale et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E,2020-07-30,2020-10-04T15:08:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
100,Digital phenotyping of complex psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. A large scale study on psychological reactions to the pandemic to inform ongoing population-level symptom tracking and response to treatment is currently lacking. Methods: Average intake scores for standard depression and anxiety symptom scales were tracked from January 1, 2017 to June 9, 2020 for patients seeking treatment from a digital mental health service to gauge the relationship between COVID-19 and self-reported symptoms. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to unstructured therapy transcript data from patients seeking treatment during the height of the pandemic in the United States between March 1, 2020 and June 9, 2020 to identify words associated with COVID-19 mentions. This analysis was used to identify symptoms that were present beyond those assessed by standard depression and anxiety measures. Results: Depression and anxiety symptoms reported by 169,889 patients between January 1, 2017 and June 9, 2020 were identified. There was no detectable change in intake depression symptom scores. Intake anxiety symptom scores increased 1.42 scale points [95% CI: 1.18, 1.65] between March 15, 2020 and April 1, 2020, when scores peaked. In the transcript data of these 169,889 patients, plus an expanded sample of 49,267 patients without symptom reports, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) identified 2,377 positively correlated and 661 negatively correlated terms that were significantly (FDR<.01) associated with mentions of the virus. These terms were classifiable into 24 symptoms beyond those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased intake anxiety symptoms for individuals seeking digital mental health treatment. NLP analyses suggest that standard symptom scales for depression and anxiety alone are inadequate to fully assess and track psychological reactions to the pandemic. Symptoms of grief, trauma, obsession-compulsion, agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, panic, and non- suicidal self-injury should be monitored as part of a new COVID-19 Syndrome category.",Thomas Hull et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-7D5-3B8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-7D5-3B8,2020-08-13,2020-10-04T14:51:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology,False
101,Why is right-wing media consumption associated with lower compliance with COVID-19 measures?,"Exposure to right-wing media has been shown to relate to lower perceived threat from COVID-19, lower compliance with prophylactic measures against it, and higher incidence of infection and death. What features of right-wing media messages account for these effects? In a preregistered cross-sectional study (N = 554) we test a model that differentiates perceived consequences of two CDC recommendations—washing hands and staying home—for basic human values. People who consumed more right-wing media perceived these behaviors as less beneficial for their personal security, for the well-being of close ones, and the well-being of society at large. Perceived consequences of following the CDC recommendations mediated the relationship between media consumption and compliance with recommendations.

102,Helplessness Among University Students: An Empirical Study Based on a Modified Framework of Implicit Personality Theories,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and within a very short period of time, teaching in the 2020 summer term changed from predominantly on-site to online instruction. Students suddenly faced having to adapt their learning process to new demands for which they may have had both insufficient digital skills and a lack of learning resources. Such a situation carries the risk that a substantial number of students become helpless. The aim of our empirical study was to test a hybrid framework of helplessness that includes both objective causes of helplessness and students' subjective interpretations of them. Before lectures or courses began, students of a full-scale university were invited to participate in an online survey. The final sample consists of 1,690 students.

103,Potential psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on children: A scoping review of pandemics & epidemics,"Context: Physical distancing and health measures, such as school closures and work-at-home mandates, implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, will likely have far-reaching impacts on children’s psychosocial health and well-being. Objective: We aimed to examine extant literature on pandemics to identify the expected impact of COVID-19 on children’s psychosocial health and secondary outcomes, including nutritional, financial and child safety outcomes. Data Sources: Articles were searched within the Medline, Global Health, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases on June 11th, 2020. Gray literature was also examined from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Fund (UNICEF) until July 24th, 2020. Study Selection: A total of 8332 articles were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Of these, 7,919 and 413 articles were from academic databases and additional sources, respectively. Data Extraction: Results on child outcomes were extracted and collated. Results: Seventy-three articles met inclusion criteria. Children have faced significant challenges with 12% of total articles indicating loneliness/depression, 21% anxiety, 7% grief, 10% stress-related disorders, 25% child abuse, 8% family conflict, and 12% stigma during pandemics/epidemics. Furthermore, 25% of articles indicated economic challenges, 23% negative academic impacts, 33% improper nutrition, and 21% reduced opportunities for play/increased screen time. These challenges were exacerbated among children who were female, having a disability, or being a migrant/displaced child. Conclusion: Pandemics and epidemics have had diverse and widespread negative consequences for children.

104,Emotion Regulation and Psychological and Physical Health during a Nationwide COVID-19 Lockdown,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses considerable challenges that threaten health and well-being. Initial data supports that many people experienced elevated psychological distress as the pandemic emerged. Yet, prior examinations of average changes in well-being fail to identify who is at greater risk for poor psychological health. The aim of the current research was to examine whether the use of different emotion regulation strategies (emotional suppression, rumination, cognitive reappraisal) predicted residual changes in psychological and physical health during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. We leveraged an ongoing study in which participants had reported on their psychological and physical health prior to the pandemic. Participants then reported on the same health outcomes as well as their use of emotion regulation strategies, stress and emotion control difficulties during a nationwide lockdown involving confinement in the home for 5 weeks. Accounting for pre-pandemic psychological health, greater emotional suppression and rumination predicted greater depressive symptoms, lower emotional well-being, greater limitations due to emotional problems, and poorer social functioning during the lockdown, even when controlling for the detrimental effects of stress and emotion control difficulties. Accounting for pre-pandemic physical health, greater rumination predicted greater fatigue and poorer physical health, but the amount of stress people experienced was a stronger predictor across physical health outcomes. The results validate concerns that the stress of the pandemic risks declines in psychological and physical health and identify emotional suppression and rumination as important risk factors of poor psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Rachel S.

105,Adolescence during a pandemic: Examining US adolescents’ time use and family and peer relationships during COVID-19,"Public health recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in closing schools and businesses and encouraging social distancing, which has reshaped adolescents’ ecologies. Adolescents’ time use during the pandemic offers insight into their lived experiences in unprecedented times, and adolescents’ activities may be shaped in important ways by their relationships and social locations. This study used a person-centered approach to describe distinct profiles of time use and examined the role of demographics, parent conflict, parent support, and friend support in differentiating time use profiles. Using a non-representative national U.S. sample of 555 adolescents, latent profile analysis of hours spent in 14 activities in a typical day identified three typologies of time use. Youth in the Education-Focused group were more likely to be male, had higher parent support, and had lower support from friends. High Media Users were more likely to be female and LGBQ-identifying and had lower parent support and higher friend support. Work-Focused youth, who were distinguished by working for pay, were more likely to be female and spend more time with friends in person. This pattern of findings suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may be creating distinct trade-offs between family and friend support that map onto how adolescents are spending their time. Results have implications for ways to strengthen relational supports and reconsider the risks and benefits of different types of time use during this stressful period in history.",Laura Wray-Lake et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-112-76B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-112-76B,2020-10-01,2020-10-02T18:48:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; lpa; social distancing; support; covid-19; parents; time use; profile analysis; conflict; adolescents; youth; teenagers; social media use; peers,False
106,"Awareness, risk perception, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in communities of Tamil Nadu, India","The health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to disproportionately impact residents of lower-middle income countries. Understanding the psychological impact of the pandemic is important to guide outreach interventions. In this study, we examined people’s awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, risk perception, and changes in behaviors and stress levels during the lockdown in peri-urban Tamil Nadu India. Field workers conducted phone call surveys (included n = 2044) in 26 communities from 20–25 May 2020. The majority perceived no (60%) or low (23%) level of risk of personally contracting coronavirus. Common fears were related to health and economic concerns, including loss of income (62%), inability to travel freely (46%), and becoming sick (46%). Residents were well aware of the common symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (66%) and dry cough (57%), but not the asymptomatic transmission (24%). The majority experienced increased stress about finance (79%) and the lockdown (51%).

Measures of Big Five personality, SWB (life satisfaction, positive affect, negative affect) and PWB (positive relations, autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance) were obtained from a sample (n = 1470) of young adults in Melbourne, Australia (13 July to 11 August, 2020) during a second wave of viral transmission and lockdown, and an identically recruited Pre-COVID sample (n = 547). Well-being was lower in the COVID sample and differences were largest for positive affect (d = -0.41) and negative affect (d = 0.64).

109,The Effect of Information Behavior in Media on Perceived and Actual Knowledge about the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses a global health threat that has dominated media coverage. However, not much is known about how individuals use media to acquire knowledge about COVID-19 under conditions of perceived threat. To address this, this study investigated how perceived threat affects media use (i.e., media volume and media breadth), and how media use in turn affects perceived and actual knowledge about COVID-19. In a German online survey, N = 952 participants provided information on their perceived threat and their media use to inform themselves about COVID-19. They further indicated how well they are informed about COVID-19 (perceived knowledge) and completed a COVID-19 knowledge test (actual knowledge). The results indicated that individuals who felt more threatened by COVID-19 used media more often to inform themselves (i.e., media volume), but focused on less different media channels (i.e., media breadth). Higher media volume was associated with higher perceived knowledge, but not with higher actual knowledge about COVID-19. Further, exploratory analyses revealed that perceived threat was linked to perceived knowledge, but not to actual knowledge. The association of perceived threat and perceived knowledge was mediated by increased media volume. Finally, a smaller media breadth was linked to higher perceived and actual knowledge.",Julia Sophia Granderath et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46202-D77-CEB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46202-D77-CEB,2020-09-07,2020-10-01T07:55:14+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; media use; perceived threat; information behavior in media; knowledge; covid-19,False
110,"Cross-Cultural comparisons of psychosocial distress in the USA, South Korea, France, and Hong Kong during the initial phase of COVID-19","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in the worldwide disruption of everyday life but the impact and response to the pandemic have not been uniform. Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the COVID-19; others did not. Whilst social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus, it is also important to examine unintended psychiatric consequences of social isolation. We examined psychological distress in four countries with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental illness. From March to July June 2020, an online survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and increased loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome, although the magnitudes of the effects were not uniform among the four countries. We also observed notable differences in psychological distress; Hong Kong, with the strictest lockdown mandate, suffered the most drastic worsening of mental health outcome.

111,Short-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ideation: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Few studies have examined the effect of pandemics on suicide-related outcomes. Aims: We examined whether suicidal ideation levels among the general population changed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking individuals between January and April 2020. Method: We used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6,683) to conduct online surveys of the general adult population in Japan before (baseline) and during the pandemic (follow-up). Results: Suicidal ideation levels were significantly lower during than before the pandemic; however, the effect size was small (r = .07). Participants who were younger, with unstable employment, without children, with low income, and receiving psychiatric care were more likely to have higher suicidal ideation levels during the pandemic. Limitations: The dropout rate may have affected the results. COVID-19 cases and deaths in Japan were relatively lower than in other developed countries. Conclusion: Although the short-term impact of COVID-19 on suicidal ideation is limited, relatively young and economically vulnerable individuals are more likely to show exacerbated suicidal ideation during the pandemic.",Hajime Sueki et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A8-A1E-A07,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A8-A1E-A07,2020-09-19,2020-10-01T07:54:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; novel coronavirus; mental health; suicide prevention; suicidal behaviors; public health,False
112,Screen time as an index of family distress,"The increase in children's screen time over the last few decades has concerned parents, educators, and policymakers alike, due to its association with negative developmental outcomes. Interventions have focused on educating parents about the apparent dangers and coaching them on how to limit screen time. Such interventions are unlikely to be effective if screen time is driven less by parental preference than by parental necessity, supplementing insufficient adult caretaker availability. We show that during the COVID crisis, screen time increased dramatically as a direct result of sudden decrease in adult caretaker availability. This indicates that lower screen time rates prior to the pandemic were not (merely) a function of well-informed parenting but of well-resourced parenting. We discuss implications for policy, as well as for the ongoing scientific debate about whether screen time is actually problematic for development.",Joshua K.

Despite their widespread use, it is not known how face masks affect human social interaction. In this behavioral economics study (N = 475), we examined how mask-wearing modulates individuals’ likelihood of acceptance of unfair monetary offers in an iterated social exchange. Overall, participants accepted more offers, including more unfair offers, from mask-wearing opponents than from opponents without a mask. This effect was enhanced when participants ascribed more altruistic motives to their interaction partner. Importantly, this pattern of results was only present for surgical face masks, but not when a non-medical cloth face covering was used.

114,"COVID-19, social isolation, and psychological distress in a Brazilian sample","Importance: The global infection outbreak by the new SARS-CoV-2 prompted community containment schedules; however, social isolation is a predictor of psychological distress. Objective: To determine whether social isolation, in Brazil, led to higher signs of psychological distress, and which intra- and inter-psychic variables mediated this effect. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) in isolated individuals, loneliness activates distancing and escape-avoidance coping strategies with intensities that are directly correlated with symptoms of anxiety and common health disorders; 2) in isolated individuals, poor reliance on social support coping strategies increase the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders; 3) in isolated individuals, External Entrapment moderates the effects of loneliness such that the higher the feelings of entrapment, the higher the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. 4) in both isolated and non-isolated individuals, intense reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies decrease (moderate) the effects of information consumption on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. No a priori hypothesis on the specific nature of the subjective experiences of social isolation were established. We proposed that the semantic field of social isolation should present a complex and multidimensional nature. Design: Two phases of web-based surveys were applied to participants between May 25th 2020 and August 19th 2020. Setting: Brazilian participants responded surveys on the web. Participants: For Phase 1, 440 participants responded to the survey. Participants were a volunteer sample of Brazilian nationality and above 18 years old. For Phase 2, a sub-sample of 55 participants was drawn from the pool of the first phase. Main outcomes and measures: For Phase 1, the primary endpoint was score in the SRQ-20 scale (an instrument to screen symptoms of common mental disorders), and the secondary endpoint was score in an anxiety scale that screened feelings of anxiety related to illness and medical procedures. Results: For Phase 1, 51% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 27.6% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 9.8% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 11.6% reported leaving the house every day. Using SRQ-20, we found that 76.9% of the female respondents and 58.0% of the male respondents that reported leaving their houses less than once a week showed clinically significant symptoms, while these proportions fell below 65% for females and 44% for males that reported leaving their houses more than 3 times per week. Reliance on escape/avoidance as well as distancing coping strategies were significant mediators of the effect of isolation-induced loneliness. We did not find support for the hypothesis that reliance on social support coping strategies significantly altered the effects of social isolation-induced loneliness on psychological distress, nor for the hypothesis that external entrapment moderated the effects of loneliness. We also found that the impact of reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies on the relationship between frequency of media use for COVID-19-related information and psychological distress depended on the type of media, with individuals which sought information from print or online newspapers, social networks, and podcasts at higher frequencies consistently showing more psychological distress; however, higher levels of positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this impact instead of decreasing it. In Phase 2 (qualitative survey), 47.3% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 21.8% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 10.9% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 20% reported leaving the house every day. At the qualitative survey we found that individuals interpreted isolation as producing self-assessment with protective and introspective dimensions, but also ruminative and emotional experiences of distress. Conclusions and relevance: Our results reveal that social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased psychological distress at clinically relevant rates, with loneliness being an important predictor of this effect. We also found that escape-avoidance and distancing coping strategies mediated this effect. Psychological distress was also related to high consumption of COVID-19-related information in social networks, print or online newspapers, and podcasts, but that relying on positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this effect instead of decreasing it. Our results suggest the need for policies that diminish the impact of social isolation on mental health; the need to assess and teach alternative coping strategies in clinical settings; and the need to address the impact of Internet-based sources.",Raíssa Oliveira De Mendonça et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46125-884-F01,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46125-884-F01,2020-09-30,2020-09-30T18:25:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; media consumption; coping strategies; mental health; covid-19; entrapment; social isolation,False
115,Correcting COVID-19 misconceptions requires caution,"Individuals generally revise their misconceptions when corrected with carefully designed educational materials. However, early reports suggest that correcting COVID-19 misconceptions may be especially challenging, which may be due to conflicts with individuals’ moral values and emotions. The present study explores the mechanisms and boundaries of correction effectiveness. Those highest in moral concerns for group cohesion or for individual freedoms were more likely to affectively or cognitively reject corrective information. Corrections of COVID-19 misconceptions should be carefully framed to connect with the morality of recipients and anticipate their emotional and cognitive reactions.",Greg Trevors et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46075-D27-FCA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46075-D27-FCA,2020-09-30,2020-09-30T17:53:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Reasoning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Process; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; values; misinformation; morality; refutations; misconceptions; covid-19; belief change; emotions; socioscientific issues,False
116,COVID-19 Health Status Scale (CHSS),"This study will explore how COVID-19 impacts physical and mental health among convenience samples taken from the general US adult population to improve health and wellbeing for vulnerable groups. Any knowledge thus gained should clarify how the pandemic has affected the overall physical and mental health of these individuals. The CHSS approach to measuring health status should help evaluate general populational needs, treatments, and programs in the COVID-19 context. Study significance. There is a lack of research on how populational health is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the context of physical and mental health functioning among the general population. This study holds significant potential in three main areas. First, the US faces an unprecedented and sweeping pandemic, which threatens both the quality of life and life itself across a broad populational spectrum. It is urgent to enhance our understanding of how COVID-19 affects the general population, which requires a rapid investigation of its widespread effects on physical and mental health. Second, the knowledge gained from exploring the relationship between COVID-19 and physical/mental health status will help design new clinical and community interventions that are tailored to general populational needs. Any new health and welfare interventions must be evaluated based on their actual impact. Third, a reliable, valid, and practical outcome measure is a priority area for understanding the physical and mental health consequences of COVID-19. Although physical and mental health care outcomes can be assessed through a variety of parameters, such as satisfaction and cost, health status is the most important.",Areen Omary,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A4-CA6-F82,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A4-CA6-F82,2020-09-30,2020-09-30T17:47:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
117,COVID-19 is Feminine: Grammatical Gender Influences Future Danger Perceptions and Precautionary Behavior,"Gendered languages assign masculine and feminine grammatical gender to all nouns, including nonhuman entities. In French, Italian, and Spanish, the name of the disease resulting from the virus (COVID-19) is grammatically feminine, whereas the virus that causes the disease (coronavirus) is masculine. In this research, we test whether the grammatical gender mark matters. In a series of experiments with French and Spanish speakers, we find that grammatical gender affects virus-related judgments consistent with gender stereotypes: feminine- (vs. masculine-) marked terms for the virus decrease perceptions of future danger of the virus and reduce intentions to take precautionary behavioral measures to mitigate contraction and spread of the virus (e.g., avoiding restaurants, movies, travel). Secondary data analyses of online search behavior for France, Spain, and Italy further demonstrate this negative relation between the anticipated threat (daily new cases and deaths, search for masks) and usage of the feminine- (vs. masculine-) marked terms for the coronavirus. These effects occur even though the grammatical gender assignment is semantically arbitrary.",Alican Mecit et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620E-8E9-48E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620E-8E9-48E,2020-09-30,2020-09-30T15:59:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Language; covid-19; grammatical gender; psycholinguistics; linguistics,False
118,"Differences Between Health Workers and General Population in Risk Perception, Behaviors, and Psychological Distress Related to COVID-19 Spread in Italy","In this study, we investigated the perception of risk and the worries about COVID-19 infection in both healthcare workers and general population in Italy. We studied the difference in risk perception in these two groups, and how this related to demographic variables and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e. medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each predictor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to general population. Also psychological state, gender, and living area were important predictors of these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as gender and alcohol consumption. We discussed these results in the light of risk factors for psychological distress and possible interventions to meet the psychological needs of healthcare workers.",Luca Simione et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623D-868-446,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623D-868-446,2020-09-30,2020-09-30T13:35:18+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; risk perception; distress; nurses; mental health; physicians; coronavirus outbreak; worry; healthcare workers; doctors; covid-19",False
119,Predicting fear and perceived health during the COVID-19 pandemic using machine learning: A cross-national longitudinal study.,"In times of medical pandemics, protective behaviors need to be motivated by effective communication, and finding predictors of perceived threat and subjective health is of importance. The varying trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries present the opportunity to include the influence of environmental factors in such analyses. Here, we investigate viral spread, governmental responses and interpersonal differences as potential predictors of fear of the virus and perceived health. We identify interpersonal factors that are important predictors, whereas environmental conditions (case/death counts, governmental response, country of residence) do not add predictive value. Critically, our machine-learning analysis and the predictive nature of our models together with the finding that nationality does not contribute to predicting our target variables promises a good generalizability for Western cultures.",Stephanie Josephine Eder et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-C03-2D0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-C03-2D0,2020-08-22,2020-09-30T11:29:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; perceived vulnerability; pathogen threat; fear appeal; machine learning; well being; covid-19; cross cultural differences; individual differences; perceives vulnerability,False
120,"Effect of political ideology, stay-at-home rates, and increased risk taking in Ohio drivers during COVID-19 shutdown","In response to COVID-19, Ohio, along with many other states, enacted a stay-at-home order in March to limit the spread of the pandemic. Crashes appear to have fallen as people stayed home, but fatal crashes did not. We investigated whether increases in speeding, alcohol use, or drug use could have taken place to offset the reduction in traffic. In addition, we examined whether support for President Trump would relate to both stay-at-home compliance and rates of crashes. Stay-at-home compliance predicted lower overall crash rate, particularly for less severe crashes, but not for fatal crashes. We did not find evidence that speeding or drug-related crashes increased during the stay-at-home order, but percentage of speed-related crashes was higher in areas with greater stay-at-home compliance. Alcohol-related crashes were involved in a greater proportion of crashes during the shutdown, and as they are more severe, may explain why fatal crashes did not fall. Support for President Trump was related to lower stay-at-home compliance and increased percentage of alcohol-related crashes controlling for median income, rurality, and Appalachian region. The combination of rejection of recommendations from public health officials and increased rates of alcohol-related crashes may put a particular burden on Republicans.",Brittany Shoots-Reinhard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46042-470-056,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46042-470-056,2020-08-21,2020-09-30T11:23:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; drug use; covid-19; alcohol use; speeding; ohio; pandemic; motor vehicle crashes; political ideology; social distancing,False
121,Cognitive Reappraisal and Self-Compassion as Emotion Regulation Strategies for Parents during COVID-19: An online RCT,"Objective. Parenting during pandemic restrictions places extreme demands on everyday family life, leading to increased stress levels for parents and distressed parent-child interactions. The goal of this RCT study was to investigate whether cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion are helpful emotion regulation (ER) strategies to reduce individual and parental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method. An online intervention for parents was developed focusing on the application of ER strategies to pandemic requirements of families. N = 265 participants were randomly assigned to either cognitive reappraisal (CR; n = 88), self-compassion (SC; n = 90) or wait-list control (WLC; n = 87) group. Interventions included two video sessions (day 1 and day 3) and three email reminders to transfer the application of ER strategies to daily family life (days 2, 4, 5). Parents’ perceived individual stress and parental stress were assessed at baseline (T0), at T1 prior to the booster session, and at T2 (7 days after baseline). Results. Significant decreases from T0 to T2 emerged for both primary stress outcomes in both intervention groups. Individual stress significantly decreased in CR compared to WLC at T2. No time × group interactions for parental stress were found. However, mediation analyses suggested that parental stress was indirectly decreased via reductions in individual stress for CR compared to WLC at both time points. Conclusions. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic to affect family life. Cognitive reappraisal as brief online intervention can ease acute stress and strengthen the mental health of parents in acute crises.",Hanna Preuss et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-A04-9DF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-A04-9DF,2020-09-16,2020-09-30T11:05:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; online intervention; self-compassion; randomized controlled trial; pandemic; emotion regulation; cognitive reappraisal; rct; stress; covid-19; parental stress; corona virus,False
122,Information about herd immunity and empathy promote COVID-19 vaccination intentions,"Objective: An effective vaccine against COVID-19 is a desired solution to curb the spread of the disease. However, vaccine hesitancy might hinder high uptake rates and thus undermine efforts to eliminate COVID-19 once an effective vaccine is available. The present contribution addresses this issue by examining two promising ways of increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Methods: We conducted two pre-registered online studies (N = 2,315 participants from the UK) in which we either measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2) knowledge about and beliefs in herd immunity, as well as empathy for those most vulnerable to the virus. As a dependent variable, we assessed individuals’ self-reported vaccination intention if a vaccine against COVID-19 became available. Results: We show that the motivation to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is related to and causally promoted by both mere information about herd immunity and by empathy. Thus, interventions that combine cognitive and affective information related to others’ potential suffering appear most effective in increasing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusions: The present research provides a better understanding of the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and highlights two evidence-based possibilities for policymakers in promoting vaccine uptake.",Stefan Pfattheicher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-E9A-7B0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46127-E9A-7B0,2020-09-30,2020-09-30T09:21:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; vaccination; prosociality; empathy; herd immunity,False
123,"Child, parent, and family mental health and functioning in Australia during COVID-19: Comparison to pre-pandemic data","The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health and wellbeing of families. This study aimed to examine: (1) patterns of parent and child (0–18 years) mental health, parent substance use, couple conflict, parenting practices, and family functioning during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic data; and (2) associations between parent, child, and family outcomes during the pandemic and both pre-existing risk factors and COVID-19 stressors. Participants were Australian mothers (81%) and fathers aged 18 years and over who were parents of a child 0–18 years (N=2,365). Parents completed an online self-report survey assessing mental health, substance use, couple conflict, parenting, and family functioning during ‘stage three’ COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Data were compared to pre-pandemic data from four Australian population-based cohorts. Compared to pre-pandemic estimates, during the pandemic period parents reported higher rates of parent mental health symptoms (Cohen’s d=0.26-.81, all p<.001), higher parenting irritability (d=0.17-.46, all p<.001), lower family positive expressiveness (d=-0.18, p<.001), and higher alcohol consumption (22% vs 12% drinking four or more days per week, p<.001). In multivariable analyses, pre-existing financial deprivation and COVID-19 stressors were associated with greater severity in parent and child mental health symptoms, parent emotion dysregulation, parenting irritability, couple conflict and family positive/negative expressiveness. Parents and children with pre-existing mental health conditions had elevated difficulties during the pandemic across most domains.

124,"‘We need clear directions, if we're going to move forward. It’s as simple as that’: Teachers’ narratives during partial school reopenings in the COVID-19 pandemic","After school closures for most pupils in March 2020, following national lockdown due to COVID-19, England prepared to reopen schools to certain year groups in June. These dramatic changes in education may have frustrated teachers’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness, as framed within Self-Determination Theory. The current study, which presents data from the second timepoint in a longitudinal study of teachers' experiences of COVID-19 in England, examines their experiences of partial reopenings of schools in mid-June. All twenty-four primary and secondary state school teachers were interviewed again and asked to tell stories of a low point, a high point and a turning point since their initial interviews in late April. A reflexive thematic analysis, using a mix of inductive and deductive coding was conducted, resulting in the identification of six themes: uncertainty, practical concerns, worry for pupils, importance of relationships, teacher identity, and reflections. Challenging their basic need for autonomy and competence, teachers were anxious about current and future uncertainties while navigating school reopenings. Challenging their basic need for relatedness, teachers described the importance of connecting with pupils and their families, and with colleagues. Lastly, teachers searched for holistic meaning, evaluating what it means to be a teacher and reflecting on how these circumstances have affected their personal and professional lives. Policy implications as to how teachers’ psychological needs can be met during a pandemic are discussed.",Lisa E.

125,The acceptability and uptake of smartphone tracking for COVID-19 in Australia,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many Governments are instituting mobile tracking technologies to perform rapid contact tracing. However, these technologies are only effective if the public is willing to use them, implying that their perceived public health benefits must outweigh personal concerns over privacy and security. The Australian federal government recently launched the `COVIDSafe' app, designed to anonymously register nearby contacts. If a contact later identifies as infected with COVID-19, health department officials can rapidly followup with their registered contacts to stop the virus' spread. The current study assessed attitudes towards three tracking technologies (telecommunication network tracking, a government app, and Apple and Google's Bluetooth exposure notification system) in two representative samples of the Australian public prior to the launch of COVIDSafe. We compared these attitudes to usage of the COVIDSafe app after its launch in a further two representative samples of the Australian public. Using Bayesian methods, we find widespread acceptance for all tracking technologies, however, observe a large intention-behaviour gap between people’s stated attitudes and actual uptake of the COVIDSafe app. We consider the policy implications of these results for Australia and the world at large.",Paul Michael Garrett et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620E-FCE-A13,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620E-FCE-A13,2020-09-29,2020-09-29T20:04:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Experimental Design and Sample Surveys; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Science and Technology Policy; covidsafe; technology uptake; attitudes; coronavirus; telecommunication; app usage; tracking technologies; australia; app uptake; smartphone; contact tracing; surveillance; bluetooth; covid19; covid; app; privacy calculus; privacy; gps,False
126,Reappraising Others' Negative Emotions as a way to Enhance Coping during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"The COVID-19 outbreak has forced individuals to adjust to a new order in which their liberties are restricted and uncertainty rules. The current work examined the role of other-focusedemotion regulation (ER) training in enhancing coping efficacy and reducing COVID-19 worries. For that, during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Israel, we trained 59 young individuals to perform other-focused emotion regulation, by reappraising others’ written upsetting events. We compared this procedure to a self-reappraisal training, in which 49 participants were asked to reappraise own upsetting events. Both procedures were performed every other day for three weeks. Participants’ coping efficacy was assessed at the daily level, while worries concerning theCOVID-19 effects on health, economic status, and social life were assessed following the training and at a two-month follow-up. The results demonstrated that other-focused ER surpassed self-focused ER. Specifically, participants in the other-reappraisal group exhibited an increase in coping efficacy across the training sessions and a reduction in COVID-19 worries that persisted two months after the training.

127,The Impact of COVID-19 Probability and Cost Estimates on Worry and Health Behavior Compliance in Young Adults,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated rates of anxiety and relatively lower compliance with public health guidelines in younger adults. To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived probability of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured 1) perceived probability as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and 2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and compliance with health behaviors, even when controlling for probability estimates. Interestingly, neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors. Our results provide important insight into decision making mechanisms involved in both increased anxiety and health compliance in COVID-19 and have implications for developing psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic strategies to target both domains.",Gabriella Imbriano et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-F2D-9B2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-F2D-9B2,2020-09-28,2020-09-28T17:37:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; decision-making; probability; covid-19; health; cost; worry,False
128,Home lockdown: Bloom or Boom? Perceived stress as mediator for longitudinal effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on wellbeing of parents and children,"Whereas children are physically less affected by the COVID-19 disease, dealing with lockdown may have negative effects on their wellbeing. At the same time, the lockdown might also have positive effects for families, as it might facilitate parent-child bonding. One important factor that may influence the direction of these effects is perceived stress in children and parents. Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced COVID-19 lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents (psychological symptoms and overreactivity) and children (internalizing and externalizing behavior). A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-old, 47% girls, majority middle-high SES and Caucasian) enrolled in the longitudinal L-CID study filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental psychological symptoms and a decrease in parental overreactivity across time. Longitudinal child measures showed a decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Perceived stress was a significant mediator of changes in parental psychological symptoms: Parents who reported more psychological symptoms prior to the lockdown experienced more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in psychological symptoms. Similar results were found for children’s externalizing behavior. Results further showed that perceived stress in children was associated with negative coping strategies, parental overreactivity and parental psychological symptoms. These results suggest that children in families with (a history of) parental psychological symptoms and overreactivity might be at risk for negative consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown.",Michelle Achterberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,2020-09-28,2020-09-28T17:35:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Gene-environment Interaction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; wellbeing; resilience; covid-19; externalizing behavior; twin study; psychological symptoms; internalizing behavior; risk factors; lockdown; parental reactivity; perceived stress; development,False
129,Information Sources Differentially Trigger Coronavirus-Related Belief Change,"During a global health crisis, people are exposed to vast amounts of information from a variety of sources. Here, we assessed which information sources could increase COVID- 19 knowledge by endorsing accurate information and refuting inaccurate information. A nationally representative sample of 1060 Cloud Research participants first rated the accuracy of a set of statements about COVID-19 (belief pre-test). Then, they were randomly assigned to one of 10 between-subjects conditions for which we varied the source that provided belief-relevant information: a political leader (President Trump or Vice-President Biden), a health authority (Doctor Fauci or the CDC), an anecdote (of a Democrat or a Republican), a large group of prior participants (Democrats, Republicans, or No affiliation), or no source (Control Condition). Finally, they rated the accuracy of the initial set of statements again (belief post-test). We found that, compared to the Control Condition, participants increased in COVID-19 knowledge by changing their beliefs to align with health authorities and with all three large groups of prior participants, and were not influenced by political leaders or anecdotes. Information source did not interact with participants’ political affiliation, suggesting that Democrats and Republicans are similarly affected by COVID-19 information sources.",Madalina Vlasceanu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617F-0FB-FFC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617F-0FB-FFC,2020-08-15,2020-09-28T13:45:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology,False

131,From ‘It has stopped our lives’ to ‘Spending more time together has strengthened bonds': The varied experiences of Australian families during COVID-19,"The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8th and April 28th, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including: 'Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion'; 'Families are missing the things that keep them healthy'; 'Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy'; 'The unprecedented demands of parenthood'; 'The unequal burden of COVID-19'; and 'Holding on to positivity'. Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude and tolerance.",Subhadra Evans et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5,2020-08-17,2020-09-28T13:36:25+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; qualitative; social restrictions; covid-19; australia; family relationships",False
132,Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an International Sample: Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and the Role of Fatalism,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency affecting millions of people and their mental health. We aimed to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the COVID-19 outbreak in an international sample and to explore the role of fatalism in behavior modification and psychological distress. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, the impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, pandemic-related stress, as well as fatalism. Traumatic impact of the pandemic was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The sample included 465 participants from 30 different countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 – 76; 80% female). Study participants were significantly affected by the pandemic. While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe traumatic impact of the pandemic. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with a lack of behavior modification in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect the mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our findings also indicate that public health interventions should take into account the negative impact of fatalism on behavior modification.",Olga Bogolyubova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D,2020-08-18,2020-09-28T13:32:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; traumatic stress; mental health; covid-19; coronavirus; ptss; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism,False
133,"A qualitative exploration of parental perceptions regarding children’s sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn","Sun protection among children is of utmost importance since sunburn in early life is a major risk factor for skin cancer development. Because parents play a vital role in enhancing sun safety among children, this study explored parental perceptions concerning sun exposure, sun protection behaviors, and sunburn in children. Additionally, the context in which children experience sunburn in order to assist the development, optimization, and targeting of sun safety interventions for parents is revealed. A qualitative study design, using a semi-structured interview guide addressing several themes (e.g. sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn experiences), was used. Data were collected in the Netherlands in the fall of 2019. Parents were recruited via purposive sampling at schools, youth services centers, and social media. In total, 26 interviews were performed. Execution, transcription, and coding of the interviews was done by two researchers, using the qualitative analyzing program Nvivo (interrater reliability of d =.84). Comprehensive findings concerning various themes were retrieved. It was found that sunburn was frequently prevalent among children, even though all parents reported using at least one sun protection measure. Parents were often unaware of their child’s sunburn and its severity. Regarding sun protection measures, parents demonstrated an overreliance on sunscreen, often failing to adequately protect their children’s skin. Water-related activities, a lack of shade, and lack of knowledge regarding UV-index were often related to sunburn. Moreover, unexpected sun exposure or longer exposure duration than initially planned were reported as challenging situations. The majority of parents had positive perceptions regarding tanned skin for both themselves as for children. This study provides directions for future skin cancer prevention efforts targeted at both parents and their children. Since a lack of knowledge regarding sufficient sun protection measures and sunburn occurrence in various situations was reported, educational efforts are warranted. Additionally, focusing on clothing, shade-seeking, and adequate sunscreen use is recommended to increase children’s sun safety. By intervening in the physical environment as well (e.g. providing shady areas), sun protection barriers can be reduced. Lastly, the general positive attitude toward tanned skin evident in this study is certainly worthy of attention in future interventions.",Karlijn Thoonen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-0F7-ABA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-0F7-ABA,2020-08-18,2020-09-28T13:26:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; parenting; health promotion; sunburn; tanned skin; sun protection behavior; children's health; skin cancer prevention,False
134,Association of COVID-19 Misinformation with Face Mask Wearing and Social Distancing in a Nationally Representative US Sample,"Wide-spread misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges for communicating public health recommendations. Should campaigns to promote protective behaviors focus on debunking misinformation or targeting behavior-specific beliefs? To address this question, we examine whether belief in COVID-19 misinformation is directly associated with two behaviors (face mask wearing and social distancing), and whether behavior-specific beliefs can account for this association and better predict behavior, consistent with behavior-change theory. We conducted a nationally representative two-wave survey of U.S. adults from 5/26/20-6/12/20 (n=1074) and 7/15/20-7/21//20 (n=889; follow up response 83%). Scales were developed and validated for COVID-19 related misinformation beliefs, social distancing and face mask wearing, and beliefs about the consequences of both behaviors. Cross-lagged panel linear regression models assessed relationships among the variables. While belief in misinformation was negatively associated with both face mask wearing (B= -.27, SE=.06) and social distancing behaviors (B= -.46, SE=.08) measured at the same time, misinformation did not predict concurrent or lagged behavior when the behavior-specific beliefs were incorporated in the models. Beliefs about behavioral outcomes accounted for face mask wearing and social distancing, both cross-sectionally (B= .43, SE=.05; B= .63, SE=.09) and lagged over time (B= .20, SE=04; B= .30, SE=.08). In conclusion, belief in COVID-19-related misinformation is less relevant to protective behaviors, but beliefs about the consequences of these behaviors are important predictors. With regard to misinformation, we recommend health campaigns aimed at promoting protective behaviors emphasize the benefits of these behaviors, rather than debunking unrelated false claims",Robert Hornik et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609C-50D-972,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609C-50D-972,2020-08-18,2020-09-28T13:14:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; covid-19; misinformation; face mask wearing; social distancing,False
135,Multiple activities change intervention as a vehicle for changing the mental health narrative and practice,"A novel intervention named multiple activities change intervention or MACI has been discussed. On 28th July 08 a 33 old male presented with history of stress, worry, and anxiety since childhood, backache since 2002, inadequate sleep, headache and body ache, acidity and abdominal discomfort, and throat discomfort – all from 2002. Results with multiple activities change intervention (MACI): baseline BDI-II score 41, 4 days later 11, and 19 days later 5. No psycho-pharmaceuticals were used. No interpretation regarding the symptoms was offered. Unfortunately, this man did not come for follow up. But there were others whom I have followed up for longer periods, and I have reported three such cases of drug resistant depression, who were utterly hopeless but showed a sharp improvement with MACI. In common mental illnesses (depression and anxiety, alcohol and tobacco use), such sharp improvements are often observed with MACI. Not so sharp but consistent improvements occurred in some other instances. As a social tool MACI has the potential to change the discourse in the field of health—and this is equally true for mental health.",Atul Agarwal,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-821-79A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-821-79A,2020-08-19,2020-09-28T13:11:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology,False
136,Protocol CHARIS study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has unprecedented consequences on population health, with governments worldwide issuing public health directives which have major impacts on normal living. In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, regular hand washing, and wearing face covering, especially when physical distancing is difficult. The application of behavioural science is central to understanding factors that influence adherence to TRBs. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people’s mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs, explain variations in adherence, and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Repeated 20-minute structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults from throughout Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling. The core survey will measure adherence to TRBs, mental and general health, and explanatory variables from the theories. Further questions will be added, enabling more detailed measurement of constructs in the core survey, additional themes, and questions that align with the evolving pandemic. Discussion This study will provide insights into the link between (changes in) adherence to TRBs and explanatory factors, and their effects on mental and general health, including event-related changes (e.g., when government directives change). Governments and other decision-makers may use these findings to tailor public health promotion, target specific population groups, and develop behaviourally informed interventions over the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (along with any subsequent equivalent events) to protect health and limit the spread of COVID-19.",Chantal Den Daas et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-C48-828,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CC-C48-828,2020-08-19,2020-09-28T13:07:59+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention,False
137,The Attitudes of Medical Students for Their Roles and Social Accountability in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,"Introduction In this study, we aimed to explore the attitude of medical students toward their roles and social accountability in this pandemic era. An online survey asked questions covering the topics of 1) the role of medical students in the pandemic era; 2) Medical education in the ‘new normal,’ and 3) the impact of COVID-19 on medical students. Methods The online survey, developed by a team consisting of 3 medical students, 3 psychiatric residents, and 3 psychiatric professors, was distributed to medical students, graduates, and professors in a single South Korean medical school. Anxiety symptom rating scales, including the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic - 6 (SAVE-6) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scale, were also applied to measure participant anxiety level. Results All of the 213 medical students, 180 graduates, and 181 professors that participated in this online survey were at the same medical school. Medical students indicated their willingness to join the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic if requested; however, graduates and professors recommended that medical students continue their medical school curriculum rather than join the response. In the new normal era, medical education was considered to be changed appropriately. Moreover, adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection and spread must be considered for the continuation of clinical clerkships during the pandemic. Overall, medical students who indicated anxiety about treating possible or confirmed cases rated higher on the SAVE-6 scale. Finally, medical students who reported that COVID-19 had an influence on their studies and daily life rated higher on the general anxiety scale (GAD-7). Conclusion Social accountability is an important issue for medical students in the pandemic era. At the same time, cultivating professionalism is also important for the readiness for the future healthcare responses.",Jihoon Hong et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-5BC-64B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-5BC-64B,2020-08-19,2020-09-28T13:06:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; pandemic; covid-19; medical students; education,False

Based on the extended parallel process model, the present work aimed to empirically investigate (N = 698) the impact of direct exposure to scientists in comparison to a general COVID-19 related media consumption. The results revealed that direct exposure to scientists positively affected recipients´ knowledge and self-efficacy.

139,"Cognitive network science reconstructs how experts, news outlets and social media perceived the COVID-19 pandemic","This work uses cognitive network science to reconstruct how experts, influential news outlets and social media perceived and reported the news “COVID-19 is a pandemic”. In an exploratory corpus of 1 public speech, 10 influential news media articles on the same news and 37,500 trending tweets, the same pandemic declaration elicited a wide spectrum of perceptions retrieved by automatic language processing. While the WHO adopted a narrative strategy of mitigating the pandemic by raising public concern, some news media promoted fear for economic repercussions while others channelled trust in contagion containment through semantic associations with science (e.g. “flatten the curve”), a strategy found also in other studies. In Italy, the first country to adopt nationwide lockdown, social discourse perceived the pandemic with anger and fear, emotions of grief elaboration, but also with trust, a useful mechanism for coping with threats. Whereas news mostly elicited individual emotions, social media promoted much richer perceptions, where negative and positive emotional states coexisted, but also where trust mainly originated from politics-related jargon rather than from science. This indicates that social media linked the pandemics to institutions and their intervention policies. The above emotions strongly influence people’s risk-averse behaviour and mental/physical wellbeing, as reviewed here in view of recent work about COVID-19. Cognitive network science opens the way to unveiling and understanding emotional framings and perceptions of news, with relevance for better understanding information flow during a global health crisis with little human coding.",Massimo Stella,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-A43-90B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-A43-90B,2020-08-25,2020-09-28T09:27:27+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Language; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; emotions; emotional profiling; emotions.; computational cognitive science; text mining; semantic networks; covid-19; social media mining",False
140,I Don’t Want to Go Back: Examining the Return to Physical Workspaces During COVID-19,"Objective: We study employee perspectives on return to physical workspaces to ultimately inform employers’ and policy makers’ decision making around the return to work during COVID-19. Methods: We tested the three-component conceptual model using survey data collected in the United States in May 2020 from samples of energy workers (N = 333). Results: Females, non-Caucasians, and employees living in multi-generational households were less willing to return. Concerns about childcare were negatively related to willingness to return, whereas organizational strategies for mitigating COVID-19 transmission at work were positively related to willingness to return. COVID-19 infections in an employees’ network were also negatively related to employees’ willingness to return. Conclusions: Blanket policies may miss the nuanced needs of different employee groups.

141,Partner Support and Goal Pursuit: A Meta-analysis,"Over the past two decades, relationship researchers have become increasingly interested in examining whether partner support is associated with a range of outcomes in times of growth and opportunity and not merely in times of distress. In the present meta-analysis, we combined evidence across studies from different theoretical perspectives addressing the association between partner support (affirmation, responsiveness, negative support, and practical support) and goal outcomes (self-efficacy, confidence, and goal progress). Thirty-three samples from 27 reports with a total of 9,568 participants in romantic relationships were included. The results were analyzed using a random-effects model and the overall effect size was r = .27. The effect size was significantly different for different types of support with affirmation having the largest effect size (r = .40) followed by responsiveness (r = .24), practical support (r = .19), and negative support (r = -.11). Furthermore, responsiveness was a significant predictor across all goal outcomes whereas practical support was a significant predictor of goal progress and commitment but not self-efficacy. Negative support significantly negatively predicted only self-efficacy but was not a significant predictor of goal progress or commitment. Studies on affirmation did not examine commitment or self-efficacy. These results provide support for relationship theories, particularly Thriving through relationships, which suggests that partners can serve as active catalysts for thriving. The results also have implications for a wide range of areas including changing health behaviors, improving productivity and motivation at work or in education, and improving engagement and outcomes in therapy.",Laura Marika Vowels et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AA-C5A-BA0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AA-C5A-BA0,2020-09-27,2020-09-27T15:49:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; partner support; close relationships; interdependence theory; goal pursuit; attachment theory,False
142,The Psychological Impact of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and examined factors exacerbating or mitigating the negative effects of lockdown. Results from a large multi-country online survey (N=8,229) showed average elevated levels of anxiety and depression (especially in the USA, UK, and Brazil), associated with feelings of low control and social isolation. Although social isolation increased with the duration of quarantine, it was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Other mitigating factors include adaptive but not maladaptive coping, and the perception and trust that one’s government is dealing with the outbreak. Taking individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of lockdown can be alleviated by maintaining frequent social contact, adaptive coping, and governmental actions which show capability, benevolence, and integrity in managing a public health crisis.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,2020-07-22,2020-09-27T09:15:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health,False
143,The Increase in COVID-19 Cases is Associated with Domestic Violence,"Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that domestic violence has increased globally since the COVID-19 pandemic, but rarely are there cross-country empirical support for this claim. Using two unique datasets which comprises official domestic violence data from Southern China (N = 152 daily data points from January 1st to May 31st, 2020) and Google Trends data across four English-speaking countries (i.e., Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States; N = 728 daily data points from January 1st to June 30th, 2020), we test the association between daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and daily reports of domestic violence. We find that daily new cases are positively associated with domestic violence in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but not in China. However, one nuance of our findings in China is that this association is lagged. We speculate that it is because that China is the first to experience the pandemic during which many people were not acutely aware of or affected by COVID-19. These findings suggest that the COVID-19 health toll is beyond its direct costs on its infectees and provide insights into social policies on public health crises. Governments need to balance their COVID-19 responses with corresponding assistance toward women and children who might be at risk of domestic violence in this difficult time.",Xin Qin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-094-1DF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-094-1DF,2020-08-25,2020-09-26T18:24:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Sexuality; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression,False
144,Addressing COVID-19 Worry and Social Isolation in Home-Based Primary Care,"Social distancing measures following the outbreak of COVID-19 have led to a rapid shift to virtual and telephone care. Social workers and mental health providers in VA home-based primary care (HBPC) teams face challenges providing psychosocial support to their homebound, medically complex, socially isolated patient population who are high risk for poor health outcomes related to COVID-19. We developed and disseminated an 8-week telephone or virtual group intervention for front-line HBPC social workers and mental health providers to use with socially isolated, medically complex older adults. The intervention draws on skills from evidence-based psychotherapies for older adults including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and Problem-Solving Therapy. The manual was disseminated to VA HBPC clinicians and geriatrics providers across the United States in March 2020 for expeditious implementation. Eighteen HBPC teams and three VA Primary Care teams reported immediate delivery of a local virtual or telephone group using the manual. In this paper we describe the manual’s development and clinical recommendations for its application across geriatric care settings.

145,"Is anyone else feeling completely unessential? Meaningful work, identification, job insecurity, and online organizational behavior during a lockdown in the Netherlands","A survey among Dutch employees (N = 408) investigated how a lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected work perceptions. Results demonstrate that employees who are not working during lockdown, or have strongly reduced work hours, perceive their job as contributing less to the greater good, identify less with their organization, and experience more job insecurity, compared to those who are still performing a high percentage of their work activities. Moreover, the longer employees were in lockdown, the weaker their greater good motivations and the more job insecurity they experienced. Additionally, we investigated the relations of work perceptions with prosocial and deviant online organizational behaviors of employees who were still working. Identification with colleagues and perceiving positive meaning in one’s job emerged as significant predictors of online organizational citizenship behavior directed at other individuals (OCB-I), whereas organizational identification predicted such behavior directed at the organization (OCB-O). Moreover, indicative of a job preservation motive, increased job insecurity was related to more online OCB-O, as well as more deviant online behaviors directed at others in the form of cyberostracism and cyberincivility.

146,The Health Behavior Model of Personality in the Context of a Public Health Crisis,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended behavioral measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. Here, we report a pre-registered longitudinal study which investigated personality predictors of compliance with CDC recommendations in diverse U.S. adults across five waves from March through August, 2020 (N=596) and cross-sectionally in August, 2020 (N=405). Agreeableness—characterized by compassion—was a strong predictor of compliance, above and beyond other traits and demographic predictors. The effect of agreeableness was robust across two diverse samples, three sets of sensitivity analyses, and was not moderated by time or demographic variables. These findings highlight the strong theoretical and practical utility of testing long-standing psychological theories using rigorous methods during real-world crises. We discuss implications of these findings for the health behavior model of personality and make recommendations for combining current health-behavior messaging with alternative appeals that are more likely to reach less agreeable individuals.",Emily C Willroth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CF-939-DDB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CF-939-DDB,2020-08-26,2020-09-26T16:46:18+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; social distancing; personality; public health; covid-19; agreeableness; health behaviors",False

This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude & practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among Bangladeshi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 1765 respondents was conducted through the social media networks of authors. The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD: 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD: 1.8, ranging: 0-17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. About 67.2 % scored well (above the mean: 4.5, range: 1-5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wear mask outside the home, and 98.7% washed hand with soap when came back. COVID-19 knowledge score was significantly associated with a lower risk of (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.92) of negative attitudes. Again, the awareness score was associated with a lower likelihood of (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98) of poor practices. Online health education programs focusing on young people, housewife and people with less education may potentially improve the attitudes and practices to control the COVID-19 pandemic in long term in such a low resource setting.",Satyajit Kundu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-F2E-68D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-F2E-68D,2020-08-27,2020-09-26T16:28:15+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; practise; knowledge; cocid-19; attitude,False
148,Mental health difficulties of adults with COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh: a case control-study,"Introduction The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with inefficient testing capacities in Bangladesh has resulted in a number of deaths from COVID-19-like symptoms that have no official test results. Insufficient test sites and healthcare facilities catered to COVID-19 has led to feelings of fear and frustration in those who are sick. This study was the first study which explored the mental health of adults with the most common COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh. Methods This retrospective case control study gathered data via an online survey to explore the mental health of Bangladeshi adults with symptoms akin to COVID-19. Level of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were measured with the DASS-21. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms of overall population were 26.9% and 52.0% respectively and 55.6% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression determined that respondents with COVID-19-like symptoms (case) reported higher odds for stress level (AOR: 2.043; CI: 1.51-2.76), anxiety symptoms (AOR: 2.770; CI: 2.04-3.77) and depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.482; CI: 1.12-1.96) than asymptomatic respondents (control).

149,"Making it abstract, making it contestable: Gender/sex as a politicized concept","The concept of gender has been the battleground of scientific and political speculations for a long time. On the one hand, some accounts contended that gender is a biological feature, while on the other hand some scholars maintained that gender is a socio-cultural construct (e.g., Butler, 1990; Risman, 2004). Some of the questions that animated the debate on gender over history are: how many genders are there? Is gender rooted in our biological asset? Are gender and sex the same thing? All of these questions entwine one more crucial, and often overlooked interrogative. How is it possible for a concept to be the purview of so many disagreements and conceptual redefinitions? The question that this paper addresses is therefore not which specific account of gender is preferable. Rather, the main question we will address is how and why is even possible to disagree on how gender should be considered. To provide partial answers to these questions, we suggest that gender/sex (van Anders, 2015; Fausto-Sterling, 2019) is an illustrative example of politicized concepts. We show that no concepts are political in themselves; instead, some concepts are subjected to a process involving a progressive detachment from their supposed concrete referent (i.e., abstractness), a tension to generalizability (i.e., abstraction), a partial indeterminacy (i.e., vagueness), and the possibility of being contested (i.e., contestability). All of these features differentially contribute to what we call the politicization of a concept. In short, we will claim that in order to politicize a concept, a possible strategy is to evidence its more abstract facets, without denying its more embodied and perceptual components (Borghi et al., 2019). So, we will first outline how gender has been treated in psychological and philosophical discussions, to evidence its essentially contestable character thereby showing how it became a politicized concept. Then we will review some of the most influential accounts of political concepts, arguing that currently they need to be integrated with more sophisticated distinctions (e.g., Koselleck, 2004). The notions gained from the analyses of some of the most important accounts of political concepts in social sciences and philosophy will allow us to implement a more dynamic approach to political concepts. Specifically, when translated into the cognitive science framework, these reflections will help us clarifying some crucial aspects of the nature of politicized concepts. Bridging together social and cognitive sciences, we will show how politicized concepts are abstract concepts, or better abstract conceptualizations.",Claudia Mazzuca et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605A-915-880,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605A-915-880,2020-08-28,2020-09-26T16:21:06+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; conceptual flexibility; political concepts; gender; abstract concepts",False
150,Maintaining Compliance when the Virus Returns: Understanding Adherence to Social Distancing Measures in the Netherlands in July 2020,"After its relative lenient, “intelligent lockdown” approach to the COVID-19 coronavirus, the Netherlands has continued its singular trajectory in combating the pandemic. The month of July introduced further relaxations to prior mitigation measures, but also saw a resurgence of infections. This working paper examines how these developments are reflected in Dutch citizens’ compliance with safe-distance measures during this period. Building on our previous surveys during the months of May and June, we report the findings of two additional survey waves collected in early (7-10) and late (21-23) July among nationally representative samples (N = 1064 and N = 1023, respectively). The results show that the decline in compliance that was observed from May to June seems to have halted. At the same time, important predictors of compliance – such as citizens’ capacity to comply, perceptions of the threat of the virus, and support for mitigation measures – have ceased to decrease, or are increasing. Taken together, these findings suggest that Dutch citizens’ compliance with mitigation measures may be on the rise again. However, our findings also suggest that social norms for compliance continue to be eroding, which may continue to dampen citizens’ tendency to comply.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46237-A7F-3FB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46237-A7F-3FB,2020-08-28,2020-09-26T16:20:05+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; social distancing; compliance; trust in science; deterrence; emotions; political orientation; social norms; netherlands; intelligent lockdown; covid-19 second wave; covid-19; impulsivity; public health; 1.5 meter society; trust in media; obligation to obey the law; safe distance measures; procedural justice",False
151,Sustaining Compliance with Covid-19 Mitigation Measures? Understanding Distancing Behavior in the Netherlands during June 2020,"In the month of June, the Netherlands had continued its singular trajectory in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. After the transition from the “intelligent lockdown” into the “1.5 meter society,” the month of June heralded further relaxations of the prior mitigation measures. Building on our previous surveys during the month of May, this paper reports the findings of two additional survey waves collected in June (between 8-11 and between 22-26) among nationally representative samples (N = 1041 and N = 1033). The results show that the processes that sustained compliance during the month of May continued to be influential, especially citizens’ intrinsic motivation to comply, their capacity to do so, their impulse control, and social norms that sustained compliance. Furthermore, there were some indications that extrinsic reasons, such as the likelihood of punishment and the fairness of enforcement, may have become more influential in shaping compliance. A comparison to the findings from May revealed, however, that compliance was gradually declining in the Netherlands, as were the resources that sustain it.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46173-D10-72C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46173-D10-72C,2020-08-28,2020-09-26T16:19:27+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; impulsivity; covid-19; safe distance measures; netherlands; intelligent lockdown; 1.5 meter society; social distancing; social norms; trust in media; public health; deterrence; procedural justice; trust in science; compliance; emotions; obligation to obey the law; political orientation",False
152,Rapid Conversion from Clinic to Telehealth Behavioral Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Survival often depends on behavior that can adapt to rapid changes in contingencies, which should be particularly well suited to a contingency sensitive and data-based discipline such as applied behavior analysis (ABA). The speed and scale with which contingencies shifted in early March due to the effects of COVID-19 represents a textbook case for rapid adaptation with direct impact on survival of many types of enterprises. We describe here the impact, changes and outcomes achieved by a large, multi-faceted ABA clinical program having: (a) ongoing data that forecasted and tracked changes; (b) staff well practiced with data-based shifts in operations (behavior); and (c) up-to-date information (data) on policy and regulations. The results showed rapid shifts in client and staff behavior on a daily basis, shifts in services from in-person to telehealth, and increases in volumes, revenue and margins. We detail regulations and provide actionable steps clinical organizations can take pertinent to this shift now and in the future.

153,Infection control in the home: A qualitative study exploring perceptions and experiences of adhering to protective behaviours in the household during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Recommended behaviours to protect against COVID-19 in the home include cleaning, handwashing, physical distancing, spending time in your own room and wearing a face-covering when in close proximity to people. Evidence is accumulating that following these behaviours can help protect against COVID-19, but adherence is mixed. This study sought to understand people’s perceptions of following these protective behaviours in the home. Methods: Nine participants were interviewed by telephone about their perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and their experiences of protecting themselves at home. Most participants were recruited via an online intervention called Germ Defence, designed to help people protect themselves from viruses in the home, but two participants were recruited via social media. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Cleaning and handwashing were widely perceived to be effective and acceptable, although some participants described how other members of their household were less adherent to these behaviours which could cause anxiety. Behaviours such as spending time in separate rooms at home and keeping physically distant were often seen as less acceptable, especially when no-one in the household had any symptoms. However, people were also aware that not putting these behaviours into practice until symptoms had developed would likely mean the virus had already spread within the home, which made them feel powerless or confused. Discussion: People felt more empowered when they understood that even small changes, such as spending some time apart, were worthwhile in order to reduce exposure and lessen viral load.",Katherine Morton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-42A-3EB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-42A-3EB,2020-09-02,2020-09-26T16:09:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; social distancing; qualitative; self-isolation; covid-19; infection control; perceptions,False
154,Self-persuasion increases motivation to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic through moral obligation,"Limiting social contacts by citizens, i.e. voluntary social isolation is proven to be an effective method of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, governments across the globe are constantly trying to encourage their citizens to socially isolate by using direct persuasion. However, a more effective method of encouraging behavioural changes is self-persuasion. Hence, using an experimental approach, we compared direct persuasion to self-persuasion on underlying motivations for voluntary social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked the subjects (N = 375) to write three arguments in support of social isolation (self-persuasion condition) or to evaluate three government graphics containing arguments for social isolation (direct persuasion condition). Then we asked the subjects to evaluate perceived own vulnerability to COVID-19, the perceived severity of COVID-19, moral obligation to socially isolate and the attitude toward social isolation. Self-persuasion had a significant impact on the moral obligation to socially isolate, and through it on self-isolation intention. We also found evidence that individuals who perceived greater benefits from social isolation and who perceived higher severity of COVID-19 have a higher intention to socially isolate. Significant sex and age differences also emerged. Our findings provide new insights into mechanisms of self-persuasion and underlying motivations that influence social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings have practical relevance to the mitigation of the pandemic, as knowing that self-persuasion can affect intention toward social isolation through moral obligation, can help effectively encourage people to socially isolate during COVID-19 pandemic.",Dariusz Drążkowski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-5D9-0DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-5D9-0DD,2020-09-26,2020-09-26T16:07:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; moral obligation; covid-19; self-persuasion; pandemic; motivation; social isolation,False
155,"A COVID-19 descriptive study of life after lockdown in Wuhan, China","On April 8th, 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between the 3rd and 7th of April, 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18th and 22nd of April, 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6th and 10th of May, 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25th and 29th of May, 2020 (Time 4). This 4-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents’ psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted. The Stage 1 manuscript associated with this submission received in-principle acceptance (IPA) on 2 June 2020. Following IPA, the accepted Stage 1 version of the manuscript was preregistered on the OSF at https://osf.io/g2t3b. This preregistration was performed prior to data analysis. Generally, our study found that: 1) a majority of people still continue to value self-isolation after lockdown was lifted; 2) by the end of lockdown, people perceived gradual return to normalcy and restored structure of everyday life; 3) the psychological well-being slightly improved after lockdown was lifted; 4) people who utilized problem-solving and help-seeking as coping strategies during lockdown had better well-being and mental health by the end of the lockdown; 5) those who experienced more disruptions in daily life during lockdown would display more indicators of psychological ill-being by the end of the lockdown.",Tong Zhou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-51B-49F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-51B-49F,2020-08-31,2020-09-26T02:42:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; well-being; stress; mental health; covid-19; coping,False
156,Standalone smartphone CBT-based Ecological Momentary Interventions to increase mental health - a narrative review,"Introduction: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphone with the aim to increase the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and provide scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles which are considered as a gold standard for the treatment of many mental health problems. Objective: This review aimed to investigate standalone smartphone-based ‘ecological momentary interventions’ (EMIs) to improve mental health, that were built based on principles derived from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between 1st January 2007 and 15th January 2020. We included studies with a focus on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, and/or efficacy and/or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, e.g., app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, i.e., choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in primary outcomes used in the studies. Results: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (m=70.8%), and outcomes were satisfying by users (m=72.6%). Conclusions: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, hence limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily life. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.",Marta Anna Marciniak et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-8DA-A42,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-8DA-A42,2020-08-31,2020-09-26T02:40:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; mhealth; covid-19; emi; cbt; mobile app; cognitive behavioral therapy; ecological momentary intervention,False

The virus instigated in bats and was transmitted to humans through yet unknown transitional animals in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 2019. There have been around 3.04 million reported cases by WHO of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and 895 thousand are recovered, 211 thousand reported deaths to date (28/04/2020) from all over the world. The disease is spread by inhalation/breathing or interaction with infected droplets. The quarantine period ranges from 2 to 14 days. The symptoms are typically breathlessness, cough, sore throat, fever, fatigue, malaise, among others. The disease is mild in most people; while in about some (generally the aged and those with comorbidities), it may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Many people are asymptomatic. Treatment is very essentially supportive; the role of antiviral agents is up till now to be recognized.

158,"Parenting Under Pressure: Chu et al., 2020 - Mixed Methods Preprint","Background: Development and implementation of effective family-based intervention and treatment strategies during COVID-19, and future public health crises, will require a detailed understanding of the ways that COVID-19 has affected parents, children, and families. Qualitative and mixed-methods research is an important means of gaining such detailed information, particularly in the early phases of the pandemic, when the research community continues to explore the meaning of this experience. Methods: We employed thematic analysis to identify themes in parents’ and children’s reflective writing about COVID-19, and explored how citation of certain themes mapped onto quantitative measures of distress commonly used in past psychosocial research on pandemics. Data were collected from N = 56 parents and N = 43 children between April to May 2020. Findings: Analysis of parent and child written reports revealed positive and negative thematic content, though parents expressed more positive themes than children. The most common themes identified from parent reports surrounded concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their children, health concerns for others, and the stressful balancing act of parenting, schooling, and working from home. In addition, many parents reported gratitude for what they had, and reflected on the upsides of the pandemic for family relations. For children, the most common themes identified surrounded missing school and social relationships. When children expressed positive themes, they tended to be more egocentric reflections (e.g. learning to ride a bike). Both parent and child thematic content mapped onto parent-proxy and parent-self reported quantitative dimensions of parent and child distress. Finally, we observed that parents who reflected on gratitude in their written reports exhibited a decrease in negative affect pre- to -post-writing. Interpretation: Both parents and children are suffering from reduced wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with the burdens imposed by the closure of in-person schooling. The psychosocial impact of the pandemic on families would likely be even greater in magnitude within less advantaged populations. Future research and policy should focus on identifying how to fulfill children’s social needs and lessen the caregiving burdens during this time.",Kristen Arianne Chu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DA-A33-509,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DA-A33-509,2020-09-25,2020-09-26T00:17:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; school closure; gratitude; qualitative; adolescents; covid-19; parents; children; family; psychosocial; mixed methods,False
159,Statistical Significance Filtering Overestimates Effects and Impedes Falsification: A Critique of Endsley (2019),"Whether in meta-analysis or single experiments, selecting results based on statistical significance leads to overestimated effect sizes, impeding falsification. We critique a quantitative synthesis that used significance to score and select “relevant” previously published effects for situation awareness-performance associations (Endsley, 2019). How much does selection using statistical significance quantitatively impact results in a meta-analytic context? We evaluate and compare results using significance-filtered effects versus analyses with all effects as-reported. Endsley reported high predictiveness scores and large positive mean correlations, but used atypical methods: the hypothesis was used to select papers and effects. Papers were assigned the maximum predictiveness scores if they contained at-least-one significant effect, yet most papers reported multiple effects, and the number of non-significant effects did not impact the score. Thus, the predictiveness score was rarely less than the maximum. In addition, only significant effects were included in Endsley’s quantitative synthesis. Filtering excluded half of all reported effects, with guaranteed minimum effect sizes based on sample size. Results for filtered compared to as-reported effects clearly diverged. Compared to the mean of as-reported effects, the filtered mean was overestimated by 56%. Furthermore, 92% (or 222 out of 241) of the as-reported effects were below the mean of filtered effects. We conclude outcome-dependent selection of effects is circular, predetermining results, impeding falsification, and running contrary to the purpose of meta-analysis. Instead of using significance to score and filter effects, meta-analyses should follow established research practices.",Jonathan Z Bakdash et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-6A0-148,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-6A0-148,2020-09-25,2020-09-25T19:29:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; psychology; validity; human factors; meta-analysis; cognitive psychology; confirmation bias; significance filter; situation awareness; p-hacking; falsification; experimental psychology; selection bias; performance; inference,False
160,"Grace Under Pressure: Resilience, wellbeing, and burnout in frontline workers in the UK and Ireland during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic","The coronavirus pandemic has necessitated extraordinary human resilience in order to preserve and prolong life and social order. Risks to health and even life are being confronted by workers in health and social care, as well as those in roles previously never defined as “frontline”, such as individuals working in community supply chain sectors. The strategy adopted by the UK government in facing the challenges of the pandemic was markedly different from other countries. The present study set out to examine what variables were associated with resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in all sectors of frontline workers, and whether or not these differed between the UK and Ireland. Individuals were eligible if they were a frontline worker (in health and social care, community supply chain, or other emergency services) in the UK or Republic of Ireland during the pandemic. Part of a larger, longitudinal study, the participants completed an online survey to assess various aspects of their daily and working lives, along with their attitudes towards their government’s handling of the crisis, and measurement of psychological variables associated with heroism (altruism, meaning in life, and resilient coping). A total of 1305 participants (N=869, 66.6% from the UK) provided sufficient data for analysis. UK-based workers reported lower wellbeing than the Ireland-based participants. In multivariate models, both psychological and pandemic-related variables were associated with levels of resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in these workers, and these differed by country. Personal factors on the whole did not differ in their contributions to outcomes between the subgroups of workers in each country. The judgment of lower timeliness in their government’s response to the pandemic appeared to be a key driver of each outcome for the UK-based frontline workers. These findings provide initial evidence that the different strategies adopted by each country may have impacted the overall wellbeing of frontline workers, with higher detriment observed in the UK.

Recently, it has been suggested that they can ameliorate the loneliness and social isolation associated with an eating disorder. However, the psychological mechanisms through which this occurs have yet to be systematically explored. Utilising the Social Identity Approach to Health, we explore whether identification with one’s family group positively predicts health and wellbeing in people with eating disorders due to its capacity to reduce feelings of loneliness. We investigate this in two studies (N=82; N=234), one of which was conducted in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In both studies, we demonstrated that family identification protects health. This was apparent in participants reporting fewer and less severe ED symptoms, and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced eating disorder-related impact and reduced anxiety. In both studies, these benefits were attributable to the protective role of family identification against loneliness. Our findings provide a framework for understanding in general why family is so important in treatment, including in the case of adults. It also supports the focus in treatment on the family as a group rather than as a collection of interpersonal relationships.",Niamh Mcnamara Dr et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600B-10A-E16,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600B-10A-E16,2020-09-24,2020-09-25T08:15:26+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; eating disorders; social identity; covid-19; family functioning; loneliness; social cure,False
162,Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions,"The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their child’s schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.",Lisa Thorell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-DEA-E25,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-DEA-E25,2020-09-24,2020-09-24T22:20:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; psychosocial effects; mental health problems; homeschooling; covid-19,False
163,"Psychological impact of a country-wide lockdown. Role of personal, behavioral, social, and physical conditions on negative and positive affect and meaning in life","The spread of COVID-19 became the main public health risk for most countries in 2020. The Spanish government declared a state of emergency, implemented lockdown measures and imposed severe restrictions on mobility and compulsory home isolation. Given this sudden situation, we tested the levels of risk perception, the psychological impact of isolation conditions and of coping behaviors. A total of 1343 adult residents in Spain participated in the study. We measured with an online questionnaire (a) risk perception; (b) individual, social, and physical conditions of isolation; and (c) a set of coping behaviors. We tested how the conditions of isolation and the individual behavior affected positive and negative affect and meaning in life. We observed that risk perception was directly linked with the individual and social situation of the participants. Personal resilience, employment status, profile of cohabitants, and using open air spaces in the house are linked with the emotional situation of the participants. Additionally, we found that some behaviors were related with positive affect, meaning in life, and negative affect. The psychological impact of a nation-wide lockdown is not universal and there are key factors that moderate this impact. We have identified key personal, behavioral, social, and physical factors that may help policy makers and citizens in critical isolation situations",Ernesto Suárez Rodríguez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-7FB-580,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-7FB-580,2020-09-24,2020-09-24T18:35:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; positive affect; : covid lockdown; meaning in life; negative affect; coping behavior; risk perception,False
164,Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the U.S.,"Background: Stressful events due to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity/reliability of the PSQ and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.",Autumn Kujawa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,2020-06-29,2020-09-24T18:34:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety,False
165,Prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depression in frontline healthcare workers treating people with COVID-19 in Bangladesh,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are in the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic are often under significant pressures which may predispose them to mental ill-health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD=6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in analyses. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were, respectively, 69.5% and 39.5% for at least borderline abnormal, 41.2% and 15.7% for at least abnormal symptoms. Regression analyses with HADS-score as dependent variable revealed significant (p<0.05) associations with female sex, moderate and poor health status, irregular physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about their profession because of the pandemic and many unexpected experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital. Conclusions: Symptoms of mental ill-health are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.

166,Psychology Students’ Motivation and Learning in Response to the Shift to Remote Instruction During COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic shifts in the teaching and learning of psychology. The purpose of this study was to document the impact of those shifts on undergraduate psychology students’ motivation and self-regulation of learning during the initial shift to remote instruction. Psychology majors (N = 358) attending a public land-grant university in the southeastern U.S. voluntarily completed a survey at the end of the Spring 2020 semester. Closed- and open-ended items assessed students’ self-reported behavioral and psychological wellness, motivation, and learning experiences during the COVID-19 outbreak. A convergent mixed methods analysis was used in which open-ended questions provided context and experiential nuance to quantitative findings. Students reported increases in sleep, social media use, gaming, and procrastination, but decreases in academic motivation and self-regulation (e.g., focusing, juggling responsibilities). Over 75% reported increases in stress, which they attributed most frequently to motivational and academic challenges. Students reported learning less in most of their classes following the shift. They attributed this to numerous internal (e.g., self-regulatory/motivational difficulties) and external (e.g., online delivery modality, changes to workload, poor communication, insufficient instructional accommodations) factors. Although most perceived their instructors as understanding, nearly half reported a decline in instructional quality and communication after the shift to remote instruction. Over one third of students reported feeling less certain about their future educational plans. Implications for the provision of institutional and instructional supports for college students during and beyond the pandemic are provided.",Ellen Usher et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46198-DEC-5CB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46198-DEC-5CB,2020-08-26,2020-09-24T03:56:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Situation; self-regulation; motivation; undergraduate psychology; covid-19; higher education,False
167,(accepted) Cognitive regulation outdoes behavior regulation in predicting state standardized test scores over time,"Individual differences in self-regulation have been a topic of increased empirical research. However, few investigations have been conducted on how sub-components of self-regulation differentially predict education outcomes over time. We examined cognitive and behavior regulation as predictors of middle-school students’ (n=127) long-term academic achievement. It has been previously reported that behavior regulation, not cognitive regulation, predicts state standardized test scores in the first year (Modrek et al., 2019). However, here we show that after two years, this pattern flips in that cognitive regulation, not behavior regulation, predicts state standardized test scores for both math and English. We analyzed the mediating role of learning using structural equation modeling, suggesting the differing roles of self-regulation in education where certain facets may or may not affect students’ long-term outcomes.",Anahid Modrek et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619A-F36-314,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619A-F36-314,2020-08-29,2020-09-24T02:49:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Cognitive Development; learning; math; cognitive regulation; self-regulation; individual differences; long-term achievement,False
168,Disordered Social Media Use and Fear of COVID-19 and the Association with Stress and Depression.,"The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global threat that has negative impacts on individuals’ physical and mental health. Here, we explore if disordered social media use promotes fear of COVID-19, which in turn increases stress and depression in users. The study also explores several risk and protective factors that may affect the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and stress and depression. There were 174 participants that completed an online survey that measured disordered social media use, fear of COVID-19, perceived stress, and depression symptomatology. We found that disordered social media use predicts perceived stress indirectly through fear of COVID-19. Disordered social media use had a direct relationship with depression scores and this relationship is mediated by fear of COVID-19. We also found that the positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress is stronger for older people than younger people. The psychological impact of COVID-19 may be exacerbated by content promoting the fear of COVID-19 that users will be exposed to on social media.",Gabriel Tillman,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604E-981-0EB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604E-981-0EB,2020-09-23,2020-09-23T22:49:26+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; stress; covid-19; social media; depression",False
169,Delay discounting and under-valuing of recent information predict lower adherence to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the day-to-day behaviours of populations globally, especially in areas where social distancing rules have been mandated. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying (un)successful behaviour change around social distancing is crucial to inform public health policy for both the current and future crises. In this study, we utilise tasks probing delay discounting (the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards) and patch foraging (evaluating the trade-off between exploiting a known resource and exploring an unknown one) to investigate cognitive predictors of social distancing and mental health symptoms. Participants (N=442) were recruited from a large UK cohort (N=2025) nationally representative in age, gender and income. Greater sensitivity to reward magnitude during delay discounting predicted lower adherence to social distancing measures and higher levels of mood and anxiety symptoms. In addition, under-valuing recently sampled information during foraging separately predicted greater violation of social distancing. Analyses examining cognitive factors underpinning social distancing behaviour across two time points (early and late phases of the pandemic) additionally revealed that greater sensitivity to magnitude of rewards on offer during delay discounting predicted a greater decline in psychological inclination to maintain social distancing. Moreover, under-valuing recent information during foraging separately predicted less motivation to engage in social distancing during the established phase of the pandemic. The findings suggest that those who typically regulate their mood through behaviours that bring about immediate reward are also those who struggle to maintain social distancing. Further, those who adapt more quickly to new information showed better ability to change their behaviour in response to public health measures. These findings highlight the need for public health initiatives that bolster sustained confidence in planning around social distancing by emphasising the immediate rewards to self as well as longer term benefits.",Alex Lloyd et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782,2020-09-22,2020-09-23T07:52:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; decision-making; coronavirus; patch; social distancing; covid-19; delay discounting; foraging,False
170,Successful Negotiation of Goal Conflict between Romantic Partners Predicts Better Goal Outcomes During COVID-19: A Mixed Methods Study,"Interdependence theory suggests that romantic partners become more interdependent as they spend more time together. Due to COVID-19, partners have been together for an extended period while coping with demands caused by the pandemic. This is likely to lead to instances of conflict between partners’ goals. Goal conflict is damaging for relationships as it continuously tests the commitment between partners. In a concurrent mixed-methods study, we investigated whether (negotiation of) goal conflict was associated with goal outcomes (progress, confidence, motivation) and what strategies partners used during the pandemic to negotiate goal conflict. Quantitative participants (n = 200) completed a daily diary for a week and weekly longitudinal reports for a month and qualitative participants (n = 48) attended a semi-structured interview. Results showed that higher goal conflict was associated with lower goal outcomes, and successful negotiation of goal conflict was associated with better goal outcomes. Qualitative analyses identified three conflict strategies (compromise, integration, concession). Conversations focused on both practical and emotional needs and included respectful communication and space from conflict (timeout or avoidance). The mixed-methods results suggest that goal conflict was relatively low during the pandemic and participants were often able to negotiate goal conflict resulting in better goal outcomes.",Laura Marika Vowels et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46094-036-8F5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46094-036-8F5,2020-08-29,2020-09-22T08:18:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; goals; mixed methods; interpersonal relationships; goal conflict; covid-19,False

172,COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity?,"In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of lockdown that impacted individual’s lifestyles, in both professional and personal spheres. New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity. Our results provide new insights on the impact of lockdown and its positive outcomes.

Most studies report the impact on mental health and mental distress during the pandemic. As a result of various stressors (such as lockdown, quarantines, and misinformation) there is heightened fear of a pandemic. The sufferer may experience a variety of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. In predisposed vulnerable individuals, fear of COVID-19 is perpetuating pain and dysfunction. This study discussed the ABC framework of fear and influencer to better understand the different levels of symptoms and interventions. There is an urgent need to integrate mental health into primary health-care centers. The attending physician should be aware of the stress disorders associated with the pandemic.

174,Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea,"South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. We aimed to document the mental health outcome in relation to social factors during the pandemic. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea.

175,Chasing the Anchor: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Perceptual Anchoring Deficits in Developmental Dyslexia,"We report the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the relationship between perceptual anchoring and dyslexia. Our goal was to assess the direction and degree of effect between perceptual anchoring and reading ability in typical and atypical (dyslexic) readers. We performed a literature search of experiments explicitly assessing perceptual anchoring and reading ability using PsycInfo (Ovid, 1860 to 2020), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1860 to 2019), EMBASE (Ovid, 1883 to 2019), and PubMed for all available years up to June (2020). Our eligibility criteria consisted of English-language articles and, at minimum, one experimental group identified as dyslexic - either by reading assessment at the time, or by previous diagnosis. We assessed for risk of bias using an adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Six studies were included in this review, but only five (n = 280 participants) were included in the meta-analysis (we were unable to access the necessary data for one study).The overall effect was negative, large and statistically significant; g = -0.87, 95% CI [-1.47, 0.27]: a negative effect size indicating less perceptual anchoring in dyslexic versus non-dyslexic groups. Visual assessment of funnel plot and Egger’s test suggest minimal bias but with significant heterogeneity; Q (4) = 9.70, PI (prediction interval) [-2.32, -0.58]. The primary limitation of the current review is the small number of included studies. We discuss methodological limitations, such as limited power, and how future research may redress these concerns. The variability of effect sizes appears consistent with the inherent variability within subtypes of dyslexia. This level of dispersion seems indicative of the how we define cut-off thresholds between typical reading and dyslexia populations, but also the methodological tools we use to investigate individual performance.",Kurt D Shulver et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E6-F3D-9D3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E6-F3D-9D3,2020-09-02,2020-09-22T07:52:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; perceptual anchoring; reading impaired; perceptual learning; dyslexia,False
176,"Child and parent physical activity, sleep and screen time during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic nationally representative data and associations with mental health","Objective: To investigate differences in movement behaviors (physical activity, sleep, screen time) in both parents and children during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, compared to pre-COVID-19 national data; and, estimate associations between these movement behaviors with parent and child mental health. Methods: We used cross-sectional baseline data from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Study (CPAS; N=2,365). Participants were parents of children aged ≤18 years, residing in Australia. We drew on nationally representative pre-COVID data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC; N=9,438). In both studies, parents provided the same self-report measures of physical activity, sleep quality, as well as measures of child physical activity and screen time. Parents reported on their own and their child’s mental health. Results: Compared to LSAC, children in CPAS had more sleep problems (17.4% vs 8.9%, p<.001) and more weekend screen time (3.98 hours vs 3.35 hours, p<.001), while more parents had poor sleep quality (56.7% vs 21.0%, p<.001) despite increased weekly physical activity (3.86 days vs 2.85 days, p<.001). Children’s sleep problems were associated with increased depression, anxiety and irritability symptoms, after accounting for physical activity and screen time (all p<.001). Poorer parent sleep quality and lower levels of physical activity were associated with poorer mental health across all indicators (all p≤.001). Conclusion: Government funded mental health programs to implement evidence-based sleep interventions for children and their parents, along with targeted messaging around physical activity should be considered to promote mental health within the family context during lockdown restrictions.",Lisa Olive et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-C6F-F9C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-C6F-F9C,2020-09-02,2020-09-22T07:33:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; anxiety; adult; parent; mental health; screen-time; children; depression; family; covid-19; sleep; physical activity,False
177,The role of personality in shaping pandemic response: Systemic sociopolitical factors drive country differences,"The current study utilizes the current COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of external political and economic factors in personality public-health research. We investigated the extent to which systemic factors modify the relationship between personality and pandemic response. Results shed doubt on the cross-cultural generalizability of common big-five factor models. Individual differences only predicted government compliance in autocratic countries and in countries with income inequality. Personality was only predictive of mental health outcomes under conditions of state fragility and autocracy.

178,No Utilitarians in a Pandemic? Shifts in Moral Reasoning during the COVID-19 Global Health Crisis,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses many real-world moral dilemmas, which can pit the needs and rights of the many against the needs and rights of the few. We investigated the influence of this contemporary global crisis on moral judgments in older adults, who are at greatest personal risk from the pandemic. We hypothesized that during this pandemic, individuals would give fewer utilitarian responses to hypothetical dilemmas, accompanied by higher levels of confidence and emotion elicitation. Our pre-registered analysis (https://osf.io/g2wtp) involved two waves of data collection, before (2014) and during (2020) the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding three categories of moral dilemmas (personal rights, agent-centered permissions, and special obligations). While utilitarian responses considered across all categories of dilemma did not differ, participants during the 2020 wave gave fewer utilitarian responses to dilemmas involving personal rights; that is, they were less willing to violate the personal rights of others to produce the best overall outcomes.",Rea Antoniou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46142-86C-CBA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46142-86C-CBA,2020-09-21,2020-09-22T01:29:36+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; pandemic; emotion elicitation; moral reasoning; utilitarian judgments; confidence; covid-19",False
179,Cognitive efficiency beats subtraction-based metrics as a reliable individual difference dimension relevant to self-control,"Conflict tasks play a central role in the study of self-control. These tasks feature a condition assumed to demand top-down control and a matched condition where control demands are assumed to be absent, and individual differences in control ability are indexed by subtracting measures of performance (e.g., reaction time) across these conditions. Subtraction-based metrics of top-down control have recently been criticized for having low test-retest reliability, weak intercorrelations across conceptually similar tasks, and weak relationships with self-report measures of self-control. Concurrently, there is growing evidence that task-general cognitive efficiency, indexed by the drift rate parameter of the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978), constitutes a cohesive, reliable individual difference dimension. However, no previous studies have examined the measurement properties of subtraction metrics of top-down control as compared to drift rate in the same sample, or compared their respective associations with self-report measures. In this re-analysis of open data drawn from a large recent study (Eisenberg et al., 2019; N=522), we find that subtraction metrics fail to form cohesive latent factors, that the resulting factors have poor test-retest reliability, and that they exhibit tenuous connections to questionnaire measures of self-control. In contrast, cognitive efficiency measures from the same tasks form a robust, reliable latent factor that shows moderate associations with self-control. Importantly, this latent cognitive efficiency variable is constructed from conditions that both were, and were not, previously assumed to index control. These findings invite a reconceptualization of subtraction-based tasks, pointing to task-general efficiency as a central individual difference dimension relevant to self-regulation.",Alexander Samuel Weigard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46007-BA9-766,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46007-BA9-766,2020-09-21,2020-09-22T00:20:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology,False
180,"Risk factors associated with loneliness, social isolation, and neuroticism in the UK Biobank cohort","Amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for establishing knowledge about risk factors for adverse health outcomes associated with loneliness and social isolation. In this study, we show that self-perceived loneliness coincides with objective measures of social isolation as well as the personality trait neuroticism, and that these comorbidities contribute to differential associations with risk factors including depression, social deprivation, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular risk, and aging of the brain. The findings contribute to identifying groups of individuals who may be vulnerable to loneliness and associated health problems, and emphasize the need for public-health initiatives addressing socioeconomic conditions as well as social, mental, and physical health to reduce the risk of loneliness and adverse health outcomes in the population.",Ann-Marie G De Lange et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-183-FF0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-183-FF0,2020-09-21,2020-09-21T18:28:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; lifestyle behavior; depression; mental health; cardiovascular risk; risk factors; neuroticism; brain aging; loneliness; social isolation,False
181,"Experiences, impacts and mental health functioning during a COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown: Data from a diverse New York City sample of college students","In March 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which resulted in a 78-day mass confinement of all residents other than essential workers. The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 911 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of students’ daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Each of these life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support students’ well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath.",Teresa Lopez-Castro et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-F5E-885,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-F5E-885,2020-09-04,2020-09-21T16:48:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; mass confinement; college students; depression; gender differences; ptsd; covid-19; racial/ethnic differences; mental health,False
182,"The Rise, Demise, and Reprise of the Increasingly Protracted APA Journal Article?","Are APA journal articles getting longer over time? Or has their growth stalled or even decreased? Earlier work that examined changes over time in article length in 24 APA journals (1986–2005) found that pages per article increased over time for the average journal, peaking around 2001, and then plateauing thereafter (Webster, 2007). In addition, journals with higher impact factors showed more linear increases in article length over time. But have these trends continued during the past 14 years? To address this question, the current research presents a replication and extension of prior work by adding additional years (1986–2015) and four additional journals (28 journals; 34 years; 865 total observations). Multilevel growth curve analyses revealed a cubic effect of time on average article length, showing an increase in the 1980s and 1990s, a plateau or slight decline in the 2000s, and a slight increase again in the 2010s. Journal impact factors (JIFs) moderated linear growth over time; journals with higher JIFs had larger linear increases in article length. Exploratory analyses showed that the cubic trend was less pronounced among the 18 APA journals that published brief reports. Exploratory multilevel interrupted time-series analyses suggested that the average linear change in pages per article over time was more positive following the start of psychology’s credibility crisis (2012–2019) than before it (1986–2011), which may relate to an increased emphasis on reporting details and transparency.

183,Supporting Families to Protect Child Health: Parenting Quality and Household Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic-linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent-child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.",Leslie E Roos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A,2020-09-04,2020-09-21T13:24:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; psychology; covid; maternal-child health; family; mental health; child development; depression,False
184,The predictive effect of quarantine regulations and anxiety on curiosity during the emerging infectious disease outbreak,"With the world-wide implementation of quarantine to suppress the spread of the COVID-19, people, having weathering a hard time, are confronted with an alarming state of mental health. For people who have taken self-quarantine at home for a long time, the anxiety and the new “staying home normality” may undermine their desire to seek information and thus might have negative effects on their curiosity. Here, we explored and examined how anxiety and the effect of quarantine regulations during the public health emergency predict different kinds of curiosity. With 1071 participants, we conducted an exploratory study (N = 570) and a confirmatory study (N = 501), with measures of anxiety, curiosity, interpersonal distancing and autistic tendency etc. There are three main findings in our results: (1) trait anxiety had negatively indirect impact on trait curiosity and the time spent on update of the COVID-19 information, however, no such correlation was found between state anxiety and epistemic curiosity; (2) state anxiety has negatively indirect impact on perceptual curiosity through increasing interpersonal distancing during quarantine; (3) interpersonal distancing and autistic tendency have negatively indirect impact on interpersonal curiosity. These effects suppressed the positive prediction of anxiety to interpersonal curiosity.

185,The Acute Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children’s Mental Health in Southwestern Ontario,"Objective: COVID-19 is an unprecedented global crisis. Research is critically needed to identify the acute and long-term impacts of the pandemic to children’s mental health including psychosocial factors that predict resilience, recovery, and persistent long-term distress. The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to enumerate the acute impact of the pandemic on children’s mental health, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial correlate of children’s distress. Method: 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported on the impact of the pandemic on children’s well-being (e.g., worry, happiness); irritability; social support; and symptoms of anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress disorder at baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Children and parents also reported higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, but fewer PTSD symptoms, compared to epidemiological samples that used the same measures prior to the pandemic. Finally, child-perceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity. Conclusions: Study findings indicate broad psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic.",Alexandra Mactavish et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-F1D-3F2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-F1D-3F2,2020-09-19,2020-09-20T14:48:14+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; child mental health; anxiety; depression; mental health; children; irritability; covid-19,False

Loneliness and social distancing results in the increased use of alcohol. Alcohol consumption for endless period during the isolation has created new cases of disorders associated with alcohol use. Especially the increased risk of infection and deteriorating symptoms. Citizens should be properly trained about alcohol-related problems during this emergency period. The Coronavirus Disease pandemic has undoubtedly had a serious impact on the supply of physical healthcare worldwide.

187,Gendered Division of Labour during a Nationwide COVID-19 Lockdown: Implications for Relationship Problems and Satisfaction,"COVID-19 lockdowns have required many working parents to balance domestic and paid labour while confined at home. Are women and men equally sharing the workload? Are inequities in the division of labour compromising relationships? Leveraging a pre-pandemic longitudinal study of couples with young children, we examine gender differences in the division and impact of domestic and paid labour during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown (N = 157 dyads). Women took on more of the parenting and housework, whereas men engaged in more paid work and personal time, during the lockdown. Couple members agreed that women’s share of parenting, housework and personal time was unfair, but this did not protect women burdened with an inequitable share of domestic labour from experiencing detrimental relationship outcomes. A greater, and more unfair, share of parenting, housework and personal time predicted residual increases in relationship problems and decreases in relationship satisfaction for women. Men who were not working full-time or were the primary caregiver also experienced negative relationship outcomes when they did more housework and parenting. These results substantiate concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may undermine advances toward gender equality by reinforcing inequitable divisions of labour, thereby damaging women’s relationship wellbeing.",Nina Waddell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BA-96E-FE0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BA-96E-FE0,2020-09-04,2020-09-20T12:01:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; covid-19 lockdown; division of labour; covid-19; relationship problems; parenting; paid work; housework,False

Objectives: Recognizing the consequences of the epidemic in the context of basic psychological needs satisfaction and frustration, the level of experienced stress, and the use of coping strategies. Design: The results of the pre-epidemic group (N = 626; aged 18 - 40) were compared with the results of the epidemic group (N = 282; aged 17 - 44). The following tests were used; BPNS&FS (Chen et al., 2015), PSS (Cohen et al., 1983), and COPE (Carver et al., 1989). Results: Women from the epidemic group reported higher levels of stress, lower satisfaction and higher frustration of autonomy and competence than the control group. Men from the epidemic group differed from the control group only by a higher frustration of autonomy. We found significant differences in coping strategy preference. The epidemic group was characterized by the following strategies: acceptance, mental disengagement, restraint, positive reinterpretation and growth, use of emotional social support, and use of humor.

189,"Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Impacts in Michigan, USA","Several racial disparities have been observed in the impacts of COVID-19 in the United States. In this paper, we used a representative sample of adults in Michigan to examine differences in COVID-19 impacts on Blacks and Whites in four domains: direct, perceived, political, and behavioral. We found that in the initial wave of the outbreak in May 2020, Blacks were more likely to be diagnosed or know someone who was diagnosed, or more likely to lose their job compared to Whites. Additionally, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19’s threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19’s spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks.

The purpose of this study was to explore current rates of mental health problems, COVID-19 related stress, substance use, and violence at home among adolescents with comparisons across genders. Method: Participants (N = 809) from Canada were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. Participants (Mage = 15.67, SD = 1.37) identified as female (56.2%), male (38.7%), or trans/non-binary individuals (TNBI; 5.1%). Results: A large portion of adolescents met clinical cut-off for depression (51.2%), anxiety (40%) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (45%). High rates of ADHD, ODD, and social phobia symptoms (ranging from 9%-20%) were also reported. Adolescents were mainly concerned with the health of family members and vulnerable populations, as well as the increased family stress at home during COVID-19. Rates of substance use were higher than expected with over 50% of youth engaging in some form of substance use, and almost 20% engaging in regular substance use. Rates of experiencing and perpetrating psychological violence at home were higher than physical violence and were close to rates in high-risk populations. TNBI and females reported higher rates of mental health problems, and violence at home compared to males.

Design: Randomised waiting list controlled trial. Setting: Swedish general population. Participants: Self-referred adults (N=670) reporting daily uncontrollable worry about covid-19 and its possible consequences (e.g. illness, death, the economy, one’s family). Participants had to experience at least one of the following negative consequences of worrying about covid-19: a) difficulties concentrating b) trouble sleeping c) constantly checking the news and social media d) marked loss of work productivity and/or e) difficulties finding joy in everyday situations. Intervention: A brief (3-week) self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional worry related to the covid-19 pandemic. Main outcome measure: A covid-19 adapted version of the self-rated Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale assessed at baseline, week 1, week 2 and week 3 (primary endpoint). Uncontrolled follow-up assessments were conducted one month after treatment completion. Results: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in covid-19-related worry for the intervention group compared to waiting list (B=1.14, Z=9.27, p<.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d=0.74 [95% CI; 0.58 to 0.90]). Improvements were also seen on all secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning, insomnia and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high.

Yet while this impact is being intensively studied with regard to a broad range of health, social, and psychological aspects, the effects of COVID-19 for creativity have been overlooked. Here, we explore COVID-19-lockdown’s consequences for creative activity. To this end, we relied on two extensive diary studies. The first, held in March 2019 (pre-pandemic), involved 78 students who reported their emotions and creativity over two weeks (927 observations). The second, conducted in March 2020 (during the pandemic and lockdown), involved 235 students who reported on their emotions, creativity, and the intensity of thinking and talking about COVID-19 over a month (5,904 observations). Multilevel meditations and dynamic structural equation modeling have shown that compared to 2019, during the lockdown, students engaged slightly, yet statistically significantly more in creative activities. Analysis of diaries collected during the pandemic also showed that students who spent more time discussing or searching for information about COVID-19 were not only more engaged in different creative activities but also declared more positive emotions.

193,Change in mental health during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Australia,"We surveyed a sample of people from the Australian public about their concerns and mental health (n = 1599) during COVID-19 lock-down. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their prior month during COVID-19 lock-down. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. Less impact was apparent for social relationships as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. We found evidence to suggest a general increase in compassion for others, as participants reported that due to the pandemic they were feeling more concerned about the welfare of people close to them (87%), and people in general (84%). However, the extent of increased concern for others was also found to be negatively associated with mental health. Most participants reported a generally favourable attitude regarding the government pandemic response. This study reveals that even when the public are largely supportive of the government response to a pandemic there can still be large public health implications due to the overall level of disruption to people's lives.",Shane L.

194,Immediate psychological responses during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi medical students,"Background: The most recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has been creating multidimensional damages, including a detrimental impact on the mental health status of individuals. Medical students, a vulnerable cross-section of the population, may have perceived a myriad of psychological stressors during this crisis in the background of their prevailing stressful academic pressure and preexisting higher psychological and mental health issue. Objective: To determine the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and to elucidate the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Bangladeshi medical students. Method: A cross-sectional study design was utilized to conduct this survey. The online survey including demographic questions, COVID-19 related questions, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; higher scores on the subscales indicate higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms), was completed by 425 Bangladeshi medical students. Collected data were statistically analyzed by using SPSS (version 25.0) software. Result: The HADS anxiety subscale revealed that 65.9% of the medical students had different levels of anxiety, ranging from mild (27.3%), moderate (26.8%), and severe (11.8%). As per HADS depression subscale, 49.9% of the medical students had varying degrees of depressive symptoms, with 3.3% of the participants had suffered from severely severe depressive symptoms. Female students had a relatively more anxiety and depressive symptoms, when compared with males. The students, who were severely tensed of getting infected by the virus, were at higher risk of suffering from anxiety (3.5-fold) and depressive (2.7-fold) symptoms, when compared with no/minimally stressed students. Besides, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to hospital or home, not to be able to give maximum concentration on study after COVID-19 pandemic, students’ present emotional status (agitation), had statistically significant higher risk of anxiety. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of Bangladeshi medical students are experiencing pandemic-related adverse psychological impact. The poor mental health conditions of these vulnerable medical students pose important threat to their potential contribution in future health care. Thus, medical colleges and health authorities should focus on addressing their psychological needs and formulate effective strategies to ameliorate medical students’ mental health status, particularly during any infectious disease outbreak.",M Tasdik Hasan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46218-308-CC2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46218-308-CC2,2020-09-11,2020-09-19T03:21:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19; bangladesh; anxiety; depressive symptoms; medical students,False
195,Prevalence and predictors of the early psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with SARS and MERS: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis,"Objective: This meta-analysis examines the psychological impact of COVID-19, SARS and MERS pandemics on health-care workers, patients and the general population, in line with PRISMA, MOOSE, MARS and CASP guidelines. Methods: Searches were conducted on 28-29 March 2020 in Pubmed, Medline, PsycInfo, APA articles, Web-of-Knowledge and scholar.google.com. Hedges’ g was calculated with random-effects models. Results: The final selection included 75 publications from 15,984 papers. Twenty-six studies described the impact of COVID-19 in 104,361 participants, showing that 59% (95%CI: 37%-85%) of health-care workers experienced acute/post-traumatic stress, and 37% (95%CI: 30%-54%) experienced depression, general distress, insomnia and/or anxiety. Of all COVID-19 patients, 32% (95% CI: 22%-42%) experienced acute/post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia and/or distress. In the general population, 25% (95%CI: 15%-35%) experienced any of these psychological symptoms. COVID-19 had a larger impact than SARS/MERS in 28,499 participants in 44 studies. During SARS/MERS pandemics, 33% (95%CI: 25%-41%) of health-care workers, 31% (95%CI: 18%-45%) of SARS/MERS-patients and 15% (95%CI: 7%-23%) of the general population experienced any of these psychological symptoms. The psychological impact was predicted (R<.20-.40>) by the individual’s physical health, restrictions to leisure and social activities, and quarantine. Frontline health-care workers experienced a larger psychological impact than the general population, particularly if they worked with infected patients and reported unfavourable work circumstances. Conclusions: This study can be used to predict the prevalence of mental health problems during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to predict which individuals are most at risk of developing mental health problems. Health care workers and vulnerable individuals should be psychologically screened and offered mental health-care. Quarantine should be as short as possible, to prevent mental health problems. Public health significance statement This meta-analysis indicates that between one-third of the general population and half of all health care workers experience a moderate to severe mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This impact is larger than during SARS and MERS pandemics. The psychological impact on health care workers is mainly predicted by their work circumstances, and the impact on the general population by their pre-existing physical and mental well-being and the psychological effects of quarantine.",Joel Vos,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E5-5B8-55D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E5-5B8-55D,2020-09-11,2020-09-19T03:21:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; review; covid-19; impact; effects; causes; emotional; frontline; acute stress; quarantine; psychology; meta-analysis; anxiety; sars; insomnia; psychiatry; depression; political; health care worker; mers,False
196,Chasing the Curve: Program Description of the Geisinger Primary Care Behavioral Health Virtual First Response to COVID-19,"Objective: In response to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an initiative to rapidly transition to a telebehavioral health (TBH) service delivery model was developed to maintain access to primary care behavioral health (PCBH) services at Geisinger across a wide, predominantly rural, geographic range. Methods: In line with the “Virtual First” approach employed by the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, we describe how we prepared for and implemented TBH services while facilitating communication and collaboration among PCBH providers, staff, and trainees, and supported our Geisinger colleagues. Results: We present operational and clinical outcomes of our approach through June 2020, as well as provider surveys of acceptability of the TBH platform used. We found that we were able to attain or surpass comparable patient access and utilization implementing TBH services compared with inperson services over the last two years. We did not observe an increase in proportion of patients with Depression and Anxiety diagnoses during the pandemic. The TBH platform was acceptable overall based on provider ratings. Conclusion: Our Virtual First approach enabled us to maintain access and utilization of PCBH services during a time of widespread uncertainty and vulnerability. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations of the approach used as well as identified next steps in navigating the “new normal” of behavioral healthcare in the age of COVID-19.",Sean O'Dell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B5-A88-4BA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B5-A88-4BA,2020-09-14,2020-09-18T22:49:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; rural mental health; primary care behavioral health; integrated care; telebehavioral health; covid-19,False
197,The association between financial hardship and mental health difficulties among adult wage earners during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: Findings from a cross-sectional analysis,"Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created several challenges including the financial burden which may result in mental health conditions. Aim: This study was undertaken to gauge the mental health difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic to gain an insight into wage earners’ mental health as they are responsible for maintaining the finance of their families in this critical situation. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey, a total of 707 individual Bangladeshi wage earners were enrolled in between 20 May 2020 and 30 May 2020. The questionnaire had sections on sociodemographic information, COVID-19 related questions, PHQ-9 & GAD-7 scales to assess depressive symptoms & anxiety, respectively. STATA version 14.1 program was used to carry out all the analyses. Results: The study revealed that 58.6% and 55.9% of the respondents had moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. The total monthly income less than 30,000 BDT (353.73USD) displayed increased odds of suffering from depressive symptoms (OR=4.12; 95% CI: 2.68-6.34) and anxiety (OR=3.31; 95% CI: 2.17-5.03). Participants who didn’t get any salary, had no income source during lockdown, had financial problem, inadequate food supply were more likely to suffer from anxiety and depressive symptoms (p ≤ .01). Perceiving the upcoming financial crisis as a stressor was a potential risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.91; 95% CI:1.32-2.77) and depressive symptoms (OR=1.50; 95% CI:1.04-2.16). Conclusion: Wage-earners in a low resource setting like Bangladesh require mental health attention.

198,Application of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-6 (SAVE-6) and Coronavirus Anxiety scales (CAS) to measure cancer patient anxiety in response to the COVID-19,"This study investigated the usefulness of the 6-item Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics (SAVE-6) scale and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) as tools to assess anxiety related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in cancer patients. A total of 221 patients with cancer responded to an anonymous online questionnaire between July 15 and August 15, 2020. The functional impairment of the patients was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the SAVE-6 and CAS were also applied. Among these 221 cancer patients, 110 (49.8%) had SAVE-6 scores ≥15 and 21 (9.5%) had CAS scores ≥5. Within the study population, 104 (47.1%) and 29 (13.1%) patients had WSAS scores ≥11 (moderate to severe functional impairment) and ≥21 (severe functional impairment), respectively. The correlations between the SAVE-6 and WSAS (p < 0.001) and CAS (p < 0.001) scores were statistically significant. The cut-off for the SAVE-6 was 15 points, while that for the WSAS was 11.

199,Health behaviors and mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal population-based survey,"Background: Health behaviors such as physical activity and a balanced diet are essential to promote and maintain health. Especially during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, they have the potential to buffer against stress and protect mental health. Method: In a longitudinal study with four measurement points over 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic, about 3,500 randomly selected participants representative of the German population reported their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, loneliness), screen time, snack consumption, and physical activity. Results: Symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were highest during the first month of the pandemic-related lockdown, particularly in women and people in poor health, and decreased over time. Screen time and snacking increased and physical activity decreased compared to pre-lockdown. Snacking and physical activity went back to pre-lockdown levels within 2 months; screen time increased further over time. Snack increase and physical activity decrease was stronger in women than men throughout the lockdown. Generally, more screen time, more snacking, and less physical activity were related to higher symptoms of anxiety, depression, and loneliness across all time points. Changes in health behaviors over time did not predict changes in mental health symptoms. Conclusions: Mental health and health behaviors worsened as an immediate response to stress but mostly returned to pre-crisis levels within 2 to 3 months. Engaging in healthier behaviors is associated with better mental health. This study provides important descriptions of (unintended) side effects of a national crisis and contributes to our understanding of how to preserve mental health.",Jutta Mata et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-F3A-32A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-F3A-32A,2020-09-06,2020-09-18T22:43:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; covid-19; lockdown; snacking; screen time; physical activity; mental health,False
200,Commonly reported problems and coping strategies during the COVID-19 crisis: A survey of graduate and professional students,"Background: The COVID-19 crisis has introduced a variety of stressors, while simultaneously decreasing the availability of strategies to cope with stress. In this context, it could be useful to understand issues that people find most concerning and ways in which they cope with stress. In this study, we explored these questions with a sample of graduate and professional students. Method: Using open-ended assessments, we asked participants (n=305) to identify their biggest challenge or concern (“top problem”), their most effective way of handling stress (“effective strategy”), and their most common way of handling stress (“common strategy”). We applied thematic analysis and evaluated whether participants’ strategies corresponded with evidence-based practices (EBPs). Results: Participants frequently reported top problems relating to productivity (27% of sample), physical health (26%), and emotional health (14%). Distraction was the most frequently classified common strategy (43%), whereas behavioral activation was the most frequently identified effective strategy (50%). Participants who reported a common strategy classified as an EBP reported lower depressive and anxiety symptoms. In contrast, there was no evidence of an association between symptom levels and whether or not participants’ effective strategy was an EBP. Participants who reported the same strategy as both their common and effective strategy (29%) reported lower depressive symptoms than those whose common and effective strategies were different. Conclusions: Our findings highlight stressors that students are experiencing and ways they are coping during the COVID-19 crisis. We discuss how these findings can inform mental health promotion efforts and future research on coping with stressors.",Akash Wasil et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-ECA-69F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D9-ECA-69F,2020-09-08,2020-09-18T22:42:26+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; evidence-based practices; coping strategies; public health; covid-19; top problems,False
201,Changes in Maternal Substance Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Maternal stress levels and mental health symptoms have significantly increased since the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic began. As a result, experts have become concerned about elevated substance use given well-known associations between negative emotions and increased substance use. Extant research has not examined substance use among mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic which is a critical next step given links between maternal substance use and adverse childhood outcomes. Methods: Data was collected April 14th to 28th, 2020 from 508 mothers (Mage = 34.8 years, SD = 5.1) with young children between the ages of 0 to 8 years old via the Parenting During the Pandemic study. To identify associations between self-reported changes in substance use, mothers completed self-reported questionnaires on their substance use, motivations for using substances, and their mental health. Results: Of participating mothers, 54.9% did not change their substance use, 39.2% increased their use, and 5.9% decreased their use. Findings indicate that mothers with an anxiety disorder or clinically relevant anxiety symptomatology were more likely to report increased substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using substances to cope with anxiety, but not depression or boredom, was significantly elevated among mothers who self-reported increased substance use during the pandemic relative to those reporting no change to or a decrease in usage. Using substances to cope with anxiety was a risk factor for increasing substance use. Discussion: A large proportion of mothers have reported increasing their substance use since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results highlight the crucial need to treat maternal anxiety and the importance of teaching mothers alternative coping strategies, other than using substances, to reduce the incidence of increased substance use among mothers and its negative sequelae.",Kayla M.

202,Improving preventive health behaviors in the COVID-19 crisis: a messaging intervention in a large nationally representative sample,"Public health communication play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. We used five well-established psychological levers to improve on the efficacy of two posters used by the French authorities (one on protective behaviors and one on proper handwashing). The five levers were: simplification (streamlining the posters), sunk costs (emphasizing the costs already paid to fight the pandemic), morality (emphasizing the duty to help others), self-protection (emphasizing the personal risks), and disgust (pointing out and illustrating that not following the protective behaviors or proper handwashing had consequences that should trigger disgust). We tested on a large (N = 3000) nationally representative French sample whether versions of the posters using these levers, compared to a control condition, were clearer, better recalled, and increased people’s intention to follow the posters’ recommendations. On the whole, there were no effects of the manipulations on any of the measures. The only consistent pattern was that the control protective behavior poster was better recalled than the alternatives (except for the simplified version), possibly because it contained one fewer message. The lack of effect on behavioral intentions might be attributed to the potential saturation in terms of health communication at the time of the experiment. Our results--mostly null and potentially negative--confirm the importance of testing interventions before using them in a public health campaign, even if they are grounded in successful past interventions.",Anne-Sophie Hacquin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-8FC-DDB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-8FC-DDB,2020-09-04,2020-09-18T22:35:34+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; psychological levers; behavioral intentions; covid-19; public health communication",False
203,A Game of COVID. Ludification as a Way to Make Sense of a Pandemic,"Many aspects of handling the COVID-19 pandemic in Western countries bear resemblance to game-design patterns like point displays and leader boards, the visible assumption of roles, classic archetypes, collection and hoarding of resources, and spatial awareness. We argue that these patterns emerge as people lack cultural and individual norms and cognitive scripts to handle a pandemic, in contrast to other catastrophic events like wars and major economic crises. Understanding this spontaneous ludification of a serious and complex situation in terms of Johan Huizinga's homo ludens can raise awareness for possible failings in dealing with COVID-19.

204,"Racial disparities in COVID-19 impacts in Michigan, USA","Several racial disparities have been observed in the impacts of COVID-19 in the United States. In this paper, we used a representative sample of adults in Michigan to examine differences in COVID-19 impacts on Blacks and Whites in four domains: direct, perceived, political, and behavioral. We found that in the initial wave of the outbreak in May 2020, Blacks were more likely to be diagnosed or know someone who was diagnosed, or more likely to lose their job compared to Whites. Additionally, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19’s threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19’s spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks.

The present research identifies how psychological factors within various bioecological systems (i.e., self, micro, macro) makeup pathways to wellbeing across developmental and diverse cultural contexts. Through Structural Equation Modeling and Machine Learning analysis on data from 426 adults (284 young adults, 142 older adults) in the United States, we found differences in how people’s own capacities and vulnerabilities (self) and their closeness to their immediate (micro) and extended environments (macro) led to differences in state-level wellbeing and resiliency and in-turn to better overall adaptation and quality of life across young and old adults.

206,The effect of ego-resiliency and COVID-19-related stress on mental health among the Japanese population,"Due to the negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is necessary to study the factors that improve mental health. In this study, we evaluated changing income, frequency of going out, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and ego-resiliency to investigate the main and moderating effects of ego-resiliency on psychological distress. We analyzed 222 Japanese samples from the dataset of Primary Survey in Japan (PSJ) in the Resilience to COVid-19 in Each Region (RE-COVER) project. The results showed significant main effects of ego-resiliency on depression (ΔR2 = .07, p < .01) and stress (ΔR2 = .02, p < .05), and interaction effect of going out and ego-resiliency on depression (β = .19, p < .01; ΔR2 = .05, p < .01). We also tested the significance of the moderating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between going out and depression. The simple slope of ego-resiliency was only significant for individuals with a low frequency of going out (β = -0.278, t (218) = -4.522, p < .001). Our findings provide empirical evidence on mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among the Japanese population, proving that ego-resiliency functioned to cope with the specific stress associated with COVID-19 and promote adaptation.",Takahiro Kubo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46117-CB2-5E4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46117-CB2-5E4,2020-09-13,2020-09-18T21:14:37+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; stress; covid-19; covid-19 related stress; ego-resiliency,False
207,No Fans - No Home Advantage. Sport Psychological Effects of Missing Supporters on Football Teams in European Top Leagues,"Introduction. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, European top football (soccer) leagues played the final rounds of season 2019/20 without or strongly limited attendance of supporters (i.e., “ghost games”). From a sport psychological perspective this situation poses a unique opportunity to investigate the crowd’s influence on sports professionals’ behavior and performance. Methods. A total of 1286 matches - played in the top leagues of Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Austria and the Czech Republic - were analyzed for result, points, goals, fouls, bookings and reason for booking and contrasted between respective games of season 2018/19 (regular attendance) and season 19/20 (“ghost games”). Results. There are three main findings. First, the marked home advantage identified in the regular 2018/19 season vanishes almost completely in the “ghost games” of the 2019/20 season. Second, home teams lose significantly more matches, whereas away teams win significantly more matches in “ghost games” compared to regular games. Third, home teams are booked significantly more often with yellow cards for committing fouls in “ghost games” relative to regular games. Conclusion. We conclude that missing supporters in professional elite football leagues dissolve the “home advantage” effect. The missing support of a “home crowd” has also a direct effect on the experience, behavior and performance of home teams. Therefore home teams tend to compensate with increased aggressive behavior, resulting directly in more fierce tackles and ultimately in significantly more yellow cards awarded for foul play.",Michael Christian Leitner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46079-0B7-EDC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46079-0B7-EDC,2020-09-09,2020-09-18T21:04:41+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; sport; yellow cards; performance; ghost games; home advantage; crowd; fans; behavior; psychology; supporters; football; covid-19; soccer",False
208,You Can’t Always Get What You Want and It Hurts: Learning During the Pandemic,"Colleges and universities around the world switched to remote teaching in early 2020. In this study we assessed the experiences of students who experienced different operationalizations of remote teaching during the first full term of instruction during the COVID pandemic. Students (N = 649) in 11 sections of Introductory Psychology participated in an online assessment of their learning after completing their final exam. We examined the level of alignment between student preferences (e.g., for synchronous lectures) with the format of the classes they were in (e.g., featuring synchronous lectures) and used this measure of fit (aligned, misaligned, no preference) and students’ modality based self-efficacy as predictors of learning. Self-efficacy predicted final exam scores and students’ ratings of the skills learned, value of science, student learning outcomes, class behaviors, and attitudes toward their class. Fit predicted differences in attitude and class related behaviors (e.g., studying). Self-efficacy also predicted the extent to which students changed their learning behaviors during the pandemic.

209,Resilience of adolescents diagnosed with anxiety and their parents in clinical sample,"Introduction: Anxiety disorder is the most frequent psychiatric problem among children and adolescents. Research proved that resilience can be a protective factor in coping with psychological difficulties. Our research focuses on these aspects of resilience. Aims: We aimed to investigate the resilience and anxiety level of families with adolescents who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Method: The clinical sample included 40 adolescents who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders and who received ambulant treatment. (18 boys and 22 girls; age: M=13.37 years, SD=1.46). Members of the control group were recruited from schools and they were normally developing adolescents without any psychiatric diagnosis. (18 boys and 19 girls, age: M=13.7 years; SD=1.56) DASS-21, Ten items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and self-made demographic sheet were used. Results: Regarding the resilience, a Significant difference was found between the clinical and the sample group both among the mothers and their children. However, in the case of fathers, no discrepancy was found. Our results suggest that there is a significant, moderate positive relationship between the resilience of the mother and their children. Nevertheless, similar mechanisms in the fathers’ case cannot be registered. In the control group, the fathers’ perception of their child’s resilience proved to be the strongest predictive factor (beta=0,495). On the contrary in the clinical group, the maternal perception was more accurate. (beta=0,06). Conclusions: Resilience can serve as a protective factor against anxiety.

210,Examining Risk and Protective Factors for Psychological Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the lives of people globally, and the significant mental health consequences of this pandemic are beginning to be documented. In addition to sociodemographic and COVID-19 specific factors, psychological risk and protective mechanisms likely influence individual differences in mental health symptoms in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined associations between a broad set of risk and protective factors with symptoms of depression, anxiety, alcohol problems, and eating pathology, and investigated interactions between objective stress due to COVID-19 and risk/protective variables in predicting psychopathology. Methods: Participants were 877 adults (73.7% female) recruited via internet sources from around the globe, but primarily residing in North America (87.4%). Results: Structural equation modelling revealed that certain risk and protective factors (e.g., loneliness, latent protective factor, mindfulness) were broadly related to psychopathology, whereas others showed unique relations with specific forms of psychopathology (e.g., greater repetitive thinking and anxiety; low meaning and purpose and depression). COVID-19 objective stress interacted with risk factors, but not protective factors, to predict greater anxiety symptoms, but not other forms of psychopathology. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study of non-randomly recruited participants who reported high levels of income and education. Rates of problematic alcohol use were low. Conclusions: Findings contribute to our understanding of psychological mechanisms underlying individual differences in psychopathology in the context of a global stressor.

211,Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Suicide: Conceptual and Practical Considerations,"The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had an adverse impact on the mental health of millions. Historical data shows that large-scale disease outbreaks are associated with elevated rates of suicide in both the short and the long term. There are certain distinctive features of the COVID-19 outbreak, from a biological as well as a psychological and social perspective, that make it likely that it will be associated with a significant increase in suicidality which may persist even after a certain degree of control has been achieved over the spread of infection. In this article, relevant historical and current literature pertaining to the association between COVID-19 and suicide are summarized and analyzed, and recommendations for preventive measures are outlined.",Ravi Philip Rajkumar,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46053-4C3-67A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46053-4C3-67A,2020-09-10,2020-09-18T20:31:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; sars-cov-2; covid-19; suicide,False
212,Sociodemographic and psychological risk factors for anxiety and depression: Findings from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) cross-sectional survey,"ABSTRACT Background: Investigations about mental health report prevalence rates with fewer studies investigating psychological and social factors influencing mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. The aims of the study were to: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression, and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, risk perception, and illness representations. Methods Cross sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. Results 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, 3.8% in the most deprived and 15.6% in the most affluent areas. Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, social isolation, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exaggerated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations, and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. Conclusions These findings confirm the results of previous studies about associations between sociodemographics and adult mental health. Loneliness, lack of social support and thoughts about Covid-19 exaggerated these effects and offer pointers for pre-emptive action.",Gill Hubbard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-9B3-409,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-9B3-409,2020-09-11,2020-09-18T20:28:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; public mental health; coronavirus; illness representations; risk perception; loneliness; social support,False
213,"Anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep patterns & associated factors among Bangladeshi wage earners during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Introduction: The economic vulnarability imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic induces stress on mental health of wage earnes in Bangladesh which is largely unexplored. This evidence gap was addressed in this study aiming to evaluate the mental health difficulties among Bangladeshi wage earners by assessing the associated factors influencing anxiety, depressive symptoms and sleep patterns. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey, a total of 707 individual Bangladeshi wage earners were enrolled in between 20 May 2020 and 30 May 2020. The questionnaire had sections on sociodemographic information, COVID-19 related information, & sleep duration; PHQ-9 & GAD-7 scales to assess depressive symptoms & anxiety, respectively. STATA version 14.1 program was used to carry out all the analyses. Results: The study revealed that anxiety and depressive symptoms among wage earners differed by gender, educational status, occupation, total monthly income (p ≤0.01). Fear of COVID-19 when working outside during the pandemic situation was inextricably linked with anxiety (AOR=2.08; 95% CI:1.42-3.04) and depressive symptoms (AOR=1.51; 95% CI= 1.04-2.20) among wage-earners. Participants who stayed at home for longer duration (>60 days) were more likely to have elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms (p≤ 0.05). Regarding sleep pattern, longer home stay during COVID-19 pandemic increased duration of sleep (β=0.70; 95% CI: 0.30 to 1.10) and respondents who were responsible to financially support their family experienced significantly decreased duration of sleep (β= -0.68; 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.20). Conclusions: The results of this study provided novel evidence on psychological difficulties among Bangladeshi wage earners which calls for an in-depth & longitudinal evaluation and immediate low intensity psychosocial interventions.",Mst.

214,The effect of binaural auditory beat stimulation on sustained attention,"Binaural beats have been used as a way of modifying cognition via auditory stimulation. A recent meta-analysis suggests that binaural beat stimulation can have a positive effect on attention (Garcia-Argibay, Santed, & Reales, 2019), with the sample-weighted average effect size being about .58. This is an intriguing and potentially useful finding, both theoretically and practically. In the present study, we focus on sustained attention. We delivered beta-frequency (16 Hz) binaural auditory beat stimulation during a sustained attention task (the psychomotor vigilance task). In Experiment 1, reaction times were numerically faster under beat stimulation than control stimulation in a between-subjects design. However, the effect was modest in magnitude, and model comparisons using Bayes Factors were indiscriminate between including and excluding the effect from the model. We followed this initial experiment two additional experiments. In the second experiment, we added thought probes to measure any changes in task-engagement associated with binaural beat stimulation. The beat stimulation had no effect on reaction times in Experiment 2, and it did not affect the thought probes responses. Combining data across the two experiments indicated rather strong evidence against the hypothesis that beta-frequency binaural beats can augment sustained attention. Finally, in Experiment 3, we investigated whether pupillary measures of arousal and/or task-engagement would be affected by binaural beat stimulation. There was no evidence for such effects. Overall, we did not observe any convincing evidence that binaural auditory beat stimulation effects sustained attention or its subjective and physiological correlates.",Matthew Kyle Robison et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A5-8F0-795,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A5-8F0-795,2020-09-18,2020-09-18T16:55:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Attention; binaural beats; vigilance; pupillometry; mind-wandering; sustained attention,False
215,Political identity over personal impact: Early US reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Research suggests political identity has strong influence over individuals’ attitudes and beliefs, which in turn can affect their behavior. Likewise, firsthand experience with an issue can also affect attitudes and beliefs. A large (N = 10,362) survey (Pew Research and Ipsos W64) of Americans was analyzed to investigate the effects of both political identity and personal impact on individuals’ reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that political identity (i.e., Democrat or Republican) and personal impact (i.e., personally affected or not) influenced different aspects of the American public’s reaction to COVID-19. Political identity exerted a strong influence on self-reports of emotional distress, threat perception, discomfort with exposure, support for restrictions, and perception of under/overreaction by individuals and institutions. Personal impact exerted a comparatively weaker influence on reported emotional distress and threat perception. Both factors had a weak influence on appraisal of individual and organizational and community responses. The dominating influence of political identity carried over into the bivariate relations among these responses. In particular, the appraisal of organizational response divided along party lines, tied to opposing views of whether there has been over- or under-reaction to the pandemic. The dominance of political identity has important implications for crisis management and reflects the influence of normative value differences between the parties, partisan messaging on the pandemic, and polarization in American politics.",Robert N Collins et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609A-84F-734,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609A-84F-734,2020-09-17,2020-09-18T16:46:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; american politics; covid-19; pandemic; political identity,False
216,Positive and negative posttraumatic outcomes among the general public and healthcare workers during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece: The role of resilience and coping strategies,"Background: Despite the indisputable negative psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder), positive ones (i.e., posttraumatic growth) are also possible. Although resilience and coping strategies have been assumed to contribute to these outcomes, findings are still scarce and inconclusive. Aim: The study aimed to examine the role of resilience and coping strategies in the positive and negative posttraumatic outcomes of the COVID-19 lockdown among the Greek general public (GP) and healthcare workers (HCWs). Materials and Methods: A sample of 1661 participants (986 GP and 673 HCWs), coming from Greece were recruited. A google-forms questionnaire was distributed during April 5-30, 2000 through social networking sites, webpages, and personal contacts of the author amid the lockdown (March 23-May 03). Sociodemographic data were collected. Measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms, posttraumatic growth, resilience, and coping strategies were also administered. Results. Regression analyses demonstrated that resilience and coping strategies were differentially associated with post-trauma outcomes. Resilience and mostly maladaptive coping strategies predicted PTSD and STS. A mixture of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies predicted PTG for both subgroups. PTSD for the GP and resilience for the HCWs also predicted PTG. Conclusions and implications. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the coping strategies used by different population subgroups in dealing with the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece.

217,Positive and negative mental health outcomes and internal resources among the general population in Greece: A nation-wide survey amid COVID-19 lockdown,"Scarce and inconclusive evidence exists on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown. This study examined the impact (positive and negative) of the lockdown, levels of resilience and use of coping strategies, and identified high-risk groups during the lockdown in Greece (05/04/2020 - 30/04/2020). A sample of 1661 participants (mean age of 39.5±12.2 years; 75.5% females) completed a google-forms questionnaire, which was distributed through social networking sites, webpages, and personal contacts. It was found that different population subgroups suffer disproportionately the impact of the lockdown. Healthcare workers, females, younger, less educated, and those living alone reported higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Females achieved more posttraumatic growth and were using more coping strategies than men. Men, older, healthcare workers, and those with a partner were more resilient.

218,Triage Dilemmas: A Window into (Ecologically Valid) Moral Cognition,"At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, frontline professionals at intensive care units around the world faced gruesome decisions about how to ration life-saving medical resources. These events provided a unique context for moral psychologists to understand how the general public reasons about real-world dilemmas involving trade-offs between human lives—in contrast to most prior research pursuing parallel questions via hypothetical thought experiments with limited relevance to the real world. In three studies (total N = 2387), we examined people’s moral attitudes toward triage of acute coronavirus patients. Our findings indicate that people generally support utilitarian approaches to critical care triage. These utilitarian tendencies do not stem from period change in people’s moral attitudes (relative to pre-pandemic levels); rather, people favor utilitarian resolutions of critical care dilemmas more than structurally analogous, non-medical dilemmas. Support for utilitarian triage decisions was rooted in prosocial dispositions, including empathy and impartial beneficence—which defies the received wisdom in moral psychology. Finally, despite abundant evidence of political polarization surrounding COVID-19, moral attitudes toward critical care triage differed modestly between liberals and conservatives. Taken together, our findings highlight people’s robust support for utilitarian measures in the face of a global public health threat. Our results also illustrate how the dominant research methods in moral psychology may be handicapped by their reliance on hypothetical stimuli (e.g., trolley cases) and could deliver insights that do not generalize to real-world, ethical priorities.",Markus Kneer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-CBF-45F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615D-CBF-45F,2020-09-18,2020-09-18T16:20:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Theory and Philosophy of Science; ecological validity; covid-19; utilitarianism; triage; moral dilemmas,False
219,Brief online cognitive behavioural intervention for dysfunctional worry related to the covid-19 pandemic: Pre-specified interim results from a randomised trial,"Objective: To investigate if a brief self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the covid-19 pandemic. Design: Randomised waiting list controlled trial. Setting: Swedish general population. Participants: Self-referred adults reporting daily uncontrollable worry about covid-19 and its possible consequences. The trial aims to include 670 participants in total. Here we present the results of a pre-specified interim analysis on data from the first 300 randomised participants. Intervention: A brief (3-week) self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional worry related to the covid-19 pandemic. Main outcome measure: A covid-19 adapted version of the self-rated Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale assessed at baseline, week 1, week 2 and week 3 (primary endpoint). Results: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in covid-19-related worry for the intervention compared to waiting list (=2.64, Z=4.02, p<.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d=0.69 [95% CI; 0.43 to 0.95]). Improvements were also seen on several secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high. No serious adverse events were recorded. Conclusions: A brief digital and easily scalable self-guided psychological intervention can significantly reduce dysfunctional worry and associated behavioural symptoms related to the covid-19 pandemic. The full trial will provide more precise estimates of the magnitude of the effects, their long-term durability, and potential adverse effects.

220,“Quick and dirty”: Intuitive cognitive style predicts trust in Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, French public opinion has been divided about Pr. Didier Raoult and his hydroxychloroquine-based treatment against COVID-19. In this paper, our aim is to contribute to the understanding of this polarization of public opinion by investigating the relationship between (analytic vs. intuitive) cognitive style and trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Through three studies (total N after exclusion = 950), we found that a more intuitive cognitive style predicted higher trust in Didier Raoult and his treatment. Possible mediators included valorization of scientific method over personal experience, belief that truth is political, belief in conspiracy theories and belief in pseudo-medicines. Additionally, we found that higher trust in Didier Raoult and hydroxychloroquine was linked to higher pseudo-medical and conspiratorial beliefs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, but not to self-reported behavior, such as lower compliance with official regulations.",Joffrey Fuhrer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-B2A-5D7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-B2A-5D7,2020-07-08,2020-09-17T17:08:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; reflection; pseudo-medicines; intuition; conspiracy theories; didier raoult; cognitive style; covid-19; hydroxychloroquine,False
221,"National Identification, A Social Cure for COVID-19? Evidence From 67 Countries","Social distancing and mass quarantines were implemented worldwide in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Prior research on the effects of social isolation has shown that such measures bear negative consequences for population health and well-being. Conversely, a growing body of evidence suggests that feeling positively identified with a group is associated with a range of physical and mental health benefits. This effect is referred to as the social cure and generalizes to various identities. In line with these findings, this study tested whether national identification could promote wellbeing and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic. To do so, we used survey data conducted among 67 countries (N = 46,450) which included measures of wellbeing, national identification, and subjective physical health. Mixed-model analyses revealed that national identity was indeed associated with wellbeing - despite adjustment on social belonging, COVID-19 perceived risk, exposure, and ideology. This effect did not extend to subjective health. These results suggest that the mere feeling of belonging to a national group may have mental health benefits and could be leveraged by governments. We discuss the implications of our findings within the social cure framework and their relevance for population mental health under COVID-19.",Eric Bonetto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46020-FE3-012,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46020-FE3-012,2020-09-08,2020-09-14T14:13:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; social cure; public health; social belonging; national identity; pandemic,False
222,Semantic information modulates online morphological learning: neuromagnetic investigation,"Learning to recognize morphemic boundaries is essential for fluent language use. In languages with rich morphology, the question of morphological learning is particularly relevant, because the abundance of bound morphemes represents one of the most challenging aspects of learning. However, neural mechanisms underlying the acquisition of novel morphological units remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the online build-up of novel suffix representations in the left frontal and temporal cortices. We trained 19 native Finnish-speaking participants with novel suffixes through a word-picture association task. Following this short semantic training session, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record the participants’ brain responses to novel suffixes combined with real and pseudoword stems. During the MEG recording, the affixed stimuli were presented in a passive listening task without attention focused on the presented sounds. Half of the novel suffixes were trained and half untrained, and real Finnish suffixes served as acoustic controls. We compared neural sources measured in the early and late phases of short passive exposure to the novel suffixes. We found an overall response enhancement for suffixes with real stems, in contrast with a general response decrease for pseudoword stems, implying that suffixes were morphologically decomposed when they were attached to a recognizable stem. Moreover, both types of novel suffixes elicited lower fronto-temporal source activations than real suffixes, suggesting that such a brief exposure may not be sufficient for the integration of novel morphological units into the mental lexicon. However, semantic training appeared to modulate the learning process already in the early stages, indicated by the different response patterns evoked by trained and untrained novel suffixes. Responses for untrained suffixes combined with real stems, in turn, increased over the course of the passive listening task, possibly reflecting memory trace formation. Previously trained suffixes, instead, showed a consistent activation pattern throughout the task. The different activation patterns for the two suffix types may reflect distinct underlying neural processing mechanisms. Untrained suffixes with merely phonological information may be processed through procedural memory, while declarative memory could be involved in case more explicit, semantic information is attached to the novel morphemes.",Viktória Roxána Balla et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-076-B94,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-076-B94,2020-09-14,2020-09-14T14:08:35+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; suffix; morphology; semantics; magnetoencephalography; rapid learning,False
223,Need Support and Regulatory Focus in Responding to COVID-19,"Prevention focus is a self-regulatory orientation that serves the need for security, and promotion focus is a self-regulatory orientation serves the need for growth. From mid-March to early April 2020, did people judge prevention focus to be more useful than promotion focus for responding to COVID-19? Our study tested this hypothesis with 401 American and Canadian participants, who we sampled in 100-person waves in the first four Thursdays of the pandemic. For this study, we developed a new measure of the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus. Results supported this hypothesis. Additionally, results showed that the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus related positively to support of the psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness, respectively, in responding to COVID-19. Day-to-day differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness support and in promotion and prevention focus suggest that people were remarkably resilient in the early weeks of the pandemic.

224,"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9).

225,Public acceptance of Privacy-Encroaching Policies to Address the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Kingdom,"The nature of the COVID-19 pandemic may require governments to use privacy-encroaching technologies to help contain its spread. One technology involves co-location tracking through mobile Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth to permit health agencies to monitor people's contact with each other, thereby triggering targeted social-distancing when a person turns out to be infected. The effectiveness of tracking relies on the willingness of the population to support such privacy encroaching measures. We report the results of two large surveys in the United Kingdom, conducted during the peak of the pandemic, that probe people's attitudes towards various tracking technologies. The results show that by and large there is widespread acceptance for co-location tracking. Acceptance increases when the measures are explicitly time-limited and come with opt-out clauses or other assurances of privacy. Another possible future technology to control the pandemic involves ""immunity passports"", which could be issued to people who carry antibodies for the COVID-19 virus, potentially implying that they are immune and therefore unable to spread the virus to other people. Immunity passports have been considered as a potential future step to manage the pandemic. We probe people's attitudes towards immunity passports and find considerable support overall, although around 20% of the public strongly oppose passports.",Stephan Lewandowsky et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-AC4-427,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-AC4-427,2020-09-04,2020-09-04T06:11:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; privacy; covid-19; public attitudes; contact tracing,False

Thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative responses. Quantitative and qualitative data are presented together. Results 253 responses were received during the UK lockdown period. Twenty-six percent of the sample were shielding and 15% felt at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Higher pre-COVID-19 depression and anxiety and lower optimism were associated with higher perceived vulnerability to and severity of COVID-19 and lower confidence in protecting oneself. There were positive and negative effects of lockdown on exercise and relationships and 42% reported negative impacts on anxiety. Participants reported fear of COVID-19, difficulties with adapting to isolation and using technology, and anxiety about the impact of delayed cancer treatment on their cancer recovery and recurrence. Conclusions Negative effects of lockdown, particularly for delayed cancer treatment should be considered to manage ongoing anxiety. Screening of state depression and anxiety is suggested for intervention prioritisation, but more longitudinal research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer survivors.",Lyndsay Hughes et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615C-857-651,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615C-857-651,2020-09-01,2020-09-03T15:26:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; anxiety; mixed-methods; breast cancer; covid-19; isolation; qualitative; depression,False
227,"Psychological, social, and situational factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions: A study of UK key workers and non-key workers","Although behavioural strategies (e.g. social distancing) have been effective in limiting the transmission of the infectious respiratory disease COVID-19, a longer- term solution, such as the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, is a global priority. Worryingly, vaccine hesitancy (i.e. the delay in acceptance or refusal of a vaccination despite its availability) is a growing concern and threat to public health. Perceptions of risk and symptom severity are important predictors of vaccine acceptance. As individuals working in key worker roles are considered to be at a higher risk of infection, this study sought to examine intentions to vaccinate and predictors of vaccine hesitancy in a UK sample of key workers and non-key workers. The study utilised a sample of UK adults who completed the 1-month follow up of The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study and indicated having not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (N = 1605). Overall, 74.2% of the sample (76.2% key workers, 73.1% non-key workers) indicated that they would accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it was available to them in future. Key workers (and in particular health and social care workers) had a higher perceived risk of becoming infected in the coming months; however, key workers and non-key workers did not differ on the perceived severity of symptoms. For key workers, being female and perceiving oneself as having relatively low risk of being infected in the next 6 months was associated with increased likelihood of vaccine hesitancy. For non-key workers, however, being aged 25-54, having a low or average income and not knowing someone diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with hesitancy. The proportion of individuals willing to accept a vaccine is encouraging but there is much room for improvement. Educating the public on the extent of asymptomatic infection and transmission may be useful since most individuals believed that if infected that would exhibit some degree of symptomology. Given the unique predictors of vaccine hesitancy in key workers and non-key workers, public health campaigns may benefit from targeted messaging. This research provides useful early estimates on intentions to vaccinate and predictors of vaccine hesitancy; however, continued monitoring is necessary as the COVID-19 situation develops and a potential vaccine is produced.",Sarah Butter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619C-861-A62,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619C-861-A62,2020-07-24,2020-09-03T15:21:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; symptom severity; perceived risk; covid-19; health behaviours; key workers; vaccine,False
228,Understanding the lived experiences of Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interpretative phenomenological analysis,"Background: Little research has examined mental health and well-being in the context of healthcare professionals (HCP) working during the COVID-19 pandemic within the UK. To our knowledge, no research has employed qualitative methodologies in order to examine this. We therefore aim to address this gap in research by qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to qualitatively examine the lived experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one broadly captured present and future challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic. Theme two captured the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs and theme three captured HCPs’ perceptions of the attitudes of the general public towards HCPs. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort.",Emily Mcglinchey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032,2020-07-24,2020-09-03T15:21:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; mental health; key workers; covid-19; qualitative research; psychological wellbeing; healthcare professionals,False
229,"Don’t put all social network sites in one basket: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and their relations with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Prior studies indicated that actively using social network sites (SNSs) is positively associated with well-being by enhancing social support and feelings of connectedness. Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being and using actively or passively various SNSs (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. Eight hundred and twenty-three persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures. Analyzes employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affects through social support. However, TikTok use was not associated with well-being and the only significant relation for Twitter was between active usage and lower satisfaction with life. Results are discussed in line with SNSs’ architectures and user’s motivations. This study concludes that SNSs must be differentiated to truly understand how they shape human interactions.",Alexandra Masciantonio et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46042-084-E99,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46042-084-E99,2020-07-18,2020-09-03T15:16:54+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; architecture; well-being; social comparison; social support; motivation; social network sites",False

This report presents data on parents and their children's well being as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic from our adult survey study. In addition to presenting additional data showing a potentially significant increase in anxiety and depression in young people aged 13-24, as a consequence of COVID-19. Data collection for our Adult Study (Wave 2) took place between 22nd April and was ended on Friday, May 1st, here we report headline figures for the impact of Covid-19 on parents and their children.

231,Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings,"COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

232,Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong,"Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing are effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health have not been investigated. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I. = [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% (95% C.I. = [18.2%, 27.2%]) of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis risk.

233,“I hate this”: A qualitative analysis of adolescents’ self-reported challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges for adolescents due to disruptions in school and social life. We compiled high schoolers’ open-ended responses to the following question: “What are your 3 biggest challenges right now?” (N=717). Using open and axial coding, we identified N=1902 thematic units (M=2.64, SD=.701) and 14 thematic categories, including mental health, physical health, family, friends, social connection and community, academics, missing important events, socioeconomic, routine, COVID rules and adjustment (e.g., social distancing), contraction/exposure to COVID, technology (e.g., screen time), and future plans. Adolescents most commonly reported challenges related to academics (23.7%), but also cited high numbers of challenges in mental (14.8%) and physical health (13.2%), and friend (11.4%) domains.

234,Moral decision making in healthcare and medical professions during the COVID-19 pandemic,"With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, healthcare and medical professions face challenging situations. High number of infected patients, scarce resources, and being vulnerable to the infection are among the reasons that may influence clinicians’ decision making and puts them in a moral situation. Furthermore, they may be carriers of coronavirus, resulting their social interactions to involve moral decision making. The aim of this study was to examine the moral decision making in clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and to find its relation to psychological, cognitive, and behavioral correlates. 193 clinicians who worked in hospitals allocated to coronavirus disease patients, participated in our study. We designed an online survey containing 8 dilemmas to test moral decision making in clinicians. Information on clinicians’ behavior, cognition and psychological state during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the degree of respect to social distancing, sources of stress, and dead cases of COVID-19 they confronted with were collected. The relation between these measures and moral decision making was assessed. Based on our results, clinicians’ most important source of stress was the infection of their families. There was a positive correlation between utilitarian responses and clinicians’ stress level, and number of dead cases they confronted with. Moreover, degree of utilitarian behavior was positively correlated to social distancing. Both age and sex contributed to individual differences in respecting social distancing, stress and utilitarian behavior. With increasing stress and encountering more deaths, clinicians tended to decide based on the outcome.

235,Short Messages Encouraging Compliance with COVID-19 Public Health Guidelines Have Minimal Persuasive Effects,"Preventing the spread of COVID-19 requires persuading the vast majority of the public to significantly change their behavior in numerous, costly ways. Many efforts to encourage behavior change – public service announcements, social media posts, speeches, billboards – involve relatively short, persuasive messages. Here, we report results of five experimental tests (N = 5,351) of persuasive short messages conducted in the US from March - July 2020. In our first two studies participants rated the persuasiveness of 56 unique messages (31 drawn from the social science literature, 25 crowdsourced from online respondents). We then conducted three well-powered, pre-registered experiments testing whether the four top-rated messages would increase intentions to comply with public health guidelines. We compare messages to both a null control condition and an “active control” message that included a reminder of the virus and suggested behaviors with no persuasive frame. Five messages in the initial studies were rated as more persuasive than a control, and four messages in the later studies increased behavioral compliance intentions relative to a null control. However, none of these messages had consistent effects when compared to the active control message. We conclude that it may not be practically possible to identify short messages that reliably out-perform a simple reminder of the virus and recommended behaviors during the advanced stages of the pandemic. The most persuasive message studied was one emphasizing people’s civic responsibility to reciprocate healthcare workers’ sacrifices, which performed best in three of five studies.",Sophia Lerner Pink et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-526-B01,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-526-B01,2020-08-10,2020-08-31T22:03:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; persuasion; messaging; health; covid-19,False

Having a supportive partner is likely to be especially important during this time where access to outside sources of support is limited. Individuals have to continue to work on goals and tasks while dealing with demands caused by the pandemic. The present mixed-methods study aimed to investigate how partner support is associated with goal outcomes during COVID-19. The quantitative participants (n = 200) completed a daily diary for a week and weekly longitudinal reports for a month and 48 participants attended a semi-structured interview.

237,“Wasn't Even on My Radar”: Increasing Parental Mediation of Influencer Marketing Behaviors in 35 Minutes with a Brief Theory of Planned Behavior Informed Online Randomized Controlled Intervention,"Online marketing to humans in their childhood, adolescent and early adulthood is an increasingly important research topic because it can on a larger scale than previously possible with traditional marketing lead to undesirable outcomes (e.g., obesity) and target more ethical grey zones between questionable, unfair and deceptive marketing to achieve its goals (Buijzen & Valkenburg, 2005; De Pauw et al., 2019). In particular, social media influencer content and embedded marketing might have a large influence on young consumers (Folkvord et al., 2019). The largest recent research trend and solution to address the problems related to online young consumer marketing was the establishment of online marketing disclosure policies (De Veirman et al., 2019; FTC, 2017; Gürkaynak et al., 2018; Riefa & Clausen, 2019). Disclosures have their merits, but also shortcomings. In particular, increased process fairness (i.e., awareness of the selling intent) appears not to be enough to diminish undesirable outcomes because young consumers also need the knowledge and the skills to counter the undesirable effects resulting from marketing exposures (De Pauw et al., 2019; Isaac & Grayson, 2019; Jung & Heo, 2019; Youn & Shin, 2019). In intervention research targeting the increase of knowledge and skills of children, the largest yet comparatively small trend are school-based interventions (De Jans et al., 2019; Nelson, 2016; O’Rourke et al., 2019; Truman & Elliott, 2019). However, school-based interventions have a few vital shortcomings. First, school-based marketing literacy interventions are costly to scale. Second, they create further competition for scare school-based financial, human and attention resources. Lastly, they might not be frequent or context-specific enough to produce a lasting change in marketing-related knowledge and skills. In contrast, parent-targeted interventions that increase the parental intentions to engage in behaviors that increase marketing-related knowledge and the skills of children do not have these shortcomings and, as a result, can be considerably more important for researchers and policymakers (De Pauw et al., 2019; Isaac & Grayson, 2019; Jung & Heo, 2019; Youn & Shin, 2019). Compared to school-based interventions, parents have more opportunities and time to influence the media diet directly and educate them with higher frequency and higher context-specificity by daily discussing the marketing their children actually engage with (Chen & Shi, 2019; Lin et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2017). Consequently, the thesis purpose was to advance the knowledge of interventions that target parental intentions to engage in marketing-literacy-relevant behaviors. To this end, the study combined a conceptual and theoretical framework based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and broader intervention science concepts, in particular behavioral change techniques (BCTs) and mechanisms of actions (MoA), and an advanced experimental design. More specifically, 21 theory-informed hypotheses were tested in a randomized controlled online experiment composed of six interventions and one control condition with a sample of 196 (pre-intervention and immediately post-intervention) and 166 participants (one-month post-intervention). Numerous contributions are made. First, relatively brief (35 minutes) TBP-based online interventions can have a significant effect on parental intentions to engage in the discussion of influencer marketing and on self-reported one-month post-intervention behaviors. Second, the combined framework was highly valuable to inform an intervention design that produces effects of practical and theoretical importance. Third, the parsimonious TPB-based model (i.e., consistent of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intentions) is also appropriate for the context of parental mediation of influencer marketing because the three-based constructs could significantly explain the majority of parental intentions (74%), and parental intentions alone significantly predicted a moderate amount variance in the future behaviors (39%). Fourth, parental attitudes were the base-construct most susceptible to change and considerably predicted intentions. Therefore, research efforts should focus on the study of parental attitudes and practical efforts should focus on targeting parental attitudes until marketing and influencer marketing become mainstream topics in the parental discourse. Lastly, despite the high intentions in the attitude only condition, the condition had no significant impact on future behaviors. Even though the attitude and three-construct condition shared an identical intention level, the three-construct intervention had a marginally non-significant (.06) effect on future behaviors. The four-construct had a significant effect on future behaviors. As a result, time spent (10 minutes vs. 33 and 35 minutes) and associated elaboration might be an important moderator of future behavior.",Paul Rohde,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620D-2F8-163,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620D-2F8-163,2020-08-24,2020-08-28T14:53:34+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; influencer marketing; parental mediation; young consumer; behavioral change; young consumer marketing; behavioral change techniques; theory of planned behavior; marketing; mechanism of actions; marketing literacy; persuasion knowledge",False
238,Toward Data-Based Case Conceptualization: A Functional Analysis Approach With Ecological Momentary Assessment,"Network analyses and process-based approaches to psychotherapy are thrilling developments for psychotherapy research and practice, but they lack a therapeutic rationale for the individual selection of treatment modules. Conceptualizing the conditional relations around human responses using functional analysis could guide case conceptualization and treatment planning. In a pilot study with four participants (a 30- and a 25-year-old man; a 19- and a 44-year-old woman), we developed and tested the feasibility and acceptance of an assessment that comprises elements of functional analysis for participants with emotional disorders. We assessed an individualized set of items three times per day, for a period of 30 days, with ecological momentary assessment while participants were waiting for psychotherapy. The implementation proved to be both feasible and accepted; participants did not report any side effects. Three datasets were included in the analysis; one had to be excluded because the minimum response rate of 80% (out of 90 data points) was not met. P-factor and network analyses revealed meaningful behavioral clusters (e.g., participant 1: hopelessness, procrastination, coping, avoidance).

239,The Stories Told in Professional Video Game Live Streaming: What Does It Mean To Be a Professional Video Game Streamer? A Case Study of the Most Popular Twitch-Streamer Ninja,"The gaming industry is now one of the largest entertainment industries and one of the rising sub-industry is video game live streaming (Video Gaming Industry, 2018). Building on the work of Johnson and Woodcock (2019), who interviewed PVGLS to construct life and career narratives based on commonalities and differences, this paper reconstructed how journalists are representing the lives and careers of PVGLS. In addition to representational analysis, a single case study design was chosen to focus on the reconstruction of one original in-depth narrative. As the case subject, the most popular video game live streamer, Mr. Blevins was elected because he represents the most successful case of a PVGLS and usually this status also makes him the most influential opinion leaders in terms of culture and practices within one community. Thus, aspiring professional or already PVGLS tend to look at Ninja as a role model and heuristic for mindsets and best practices to adopt. Consequently, his thoughts about himself as a PVGLS, the community of PVGLS and the community of VGLS are espe-cially relevant. Ultimately, he represents also the whole PVGLS community as a whole when he gives interviews on big shows on traditional media channels (Cash, 2018). To enable tri-angulation 15 written news article interviews were collected from different news outlets. Compared to Johnson & Woodcock (2019) analysis of past narratives that focused on the question how PVGLS moved to streaming, this study goes more in-depth in the past narrative of PVGLS by starting with Blevins childhood and identifying subsequent the crucial events and factors influencing his current mindset, behavior and successful position. His superior ability to perform and provide a high-level gaming and entertainment experience is influ-enced by his early on favorable social environment (i.e., parents, siblings, friends, wife), the personal inclination for competitive gaming and entertainment, high drive for learning and a vast amount of practice. After understanding the factors that got him to his current position, we reconstruct his current daily life with the potentials, challenges and his motivation. Mr. Blevins’s past and present narratives echo the finding of Johnson & Woodcock (2019) that PVGLS’s amount of work-ing time devoted to streaming was significant, often far more than the 35 average job hours. However, compared to the PVGLS interviews by Johnson and Woodcock (2019), Mr. Blevins seems also to exhibit a more entrepreneurial and profit-optimizing mindset. Overall, the reconstructed narrative, based on the journalists' interests, explores more in-depth what it means to be a PVGLS. In fact, the focus is on his life as a PVGLS, his challenges and poten-tials as a PVGLS, PVGLS as a career path. Blevins narrative clearly outlines the importance of various factors to become and stay one of the most popular and successful PVGLS. There is a large overlap in the factors mentioned in the past narrative, namely intense work ethic, sacrifice of social and personal goals, supportive social relationships, the motivation for this intense work ethic of achieve a certain level of financial security and the pressure to perform and compete at a high level to secure these financial outcomes. Ultimately, we investigated his perceptions and ambitions about his future. In many areas, there is an overlap between the attitudes and topics found by Johnson and Woodcock (2019) in their interviews. Both Mr. Blevins and the interviewed PVGLS share (1) the enjoy of their work and want it to continue indefinitely, despite the substantial amounts of time and effort investment and the emotional and background labor (2) feelings of precariousness in their streaming activities, having a backup plan (3) the common belief that Twitch and streaming would only continue to grow. It is surprising that even with Mr. Blevins’s level of financial success, being the biggest streamer in the world, he shares the sentiment of precariousness indicating a more cultural subjective than objective opinion. Further, Mr. Blevins seems more confident and optimistic about his future overall compared to the interviews PVGLS as Johnson and Woodcock (2019).

240,"Finding the Power Within: Is Resilience Protective Against Symptoms of Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Australian Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The present study utilised a strengths-based approach to investigate the association between resilience and indicators of mental health in a large sample of Australian parents at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was nested within a large longitudinal cohort study of Australian parents of a child aged 0‐18 years. Hierarchical regression models were run to examine the relationship between the variables of interest. Of 2,110 respondents included, 1701 (80.6%) were female. Higher resilience was associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Loneliness was a key contributor to mental health outcomes. An increase in extraversion was associated with improved resilience. The relationship between resilience and depression was influenced by the level of partner support. Interventions targeting mental health of parents at the time of pandemics should focus on reducing loneliness while working with the constraints of imposed social isolation, and to include partners.",Antonina Mikocka-Walus et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-FF3-17E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-FF3-17E,2020-08-25,2020-08-28T14:47:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood,False
241,When Social Interaction Backfires: Frequent Social Interaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period Is Associated with Decreased Well-Being and Higher Panic Buying,"The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying. Overall, our findings indicated that frequent social interaction under a highly novel and uncertain crisis can induce negative consequences on mental health and behavior.",Hyunji Kim et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-63E-D8A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-63E-D8A,2020-07-03,2020-08-24T14:39:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; well-being; social interaction; panic buying; general confidence level; self-other connectedness; word-of-mouth; covid-19,False
242,Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.",Samantha M.

243,Staying ‘In Sync’ with Others During COVID-19: Positivity Resonance Mediates Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Links between Trait Resilience and Mental Health,"Shared positive emotions involving caring and synchrony—termed “positivity resonance”—are associated with mental health (Major et al., 2018). We hypothesized that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual differences in trait resilience would be linked with better overall mental health in part because those higher in trait resilience experience more positivity resonance. We surveyed respondents nationally in April and May of 2020 (total N = 1,059), during pervasive stay-at-home orders. Participants completed self-reports of trait resilience and mental health and used the Day Reconstruction Method to describe their social and emotional experiences. Structural equation models showed positivity resonance to mediate the links between trait resilience and mental health outcomes. Subsequent analyses showed these mediating effects to be independent of overall positive emotion and social interaction quantity (amongst nationwide adults). These results indicate that high-quality social connection played a uniquely important role in maintaining mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Michael Prinzing et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-5DF-0F7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-5DF-0F7,2020-08-17,2020-08-19T17:08:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; broaden-and-build theory; social interaction; affective science; positive psychology; well-being,False
244,Externalizing Behavior and Academic Achievement : Does Evidence for Causal Relations Exist?,"Children’s low academic skills are associated with a variety of behavior problems and maladaptive outcomes throughout childhood and adulthood. Given the prevalence of behavioral disorders is approximately 19% of all US children, understanding of the mechanisms through which academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems interact can inform effective intervention to prevent persistent academic failure, chronic behavioral difficulties, and related negative long-term outcomes. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to systematically review research on the association between low academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems, as well as evaluate the research indicating causal linkages, if any, between the two domains. Five databases were searched, including OVID Medline, PsycInfo, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, Education Resource and PROQUEST. Search terms included statistical designs that could support a hypothetical causal association (e.g., structural equation modeling). We screened a total of 1,990 studies, of which 26 met the final inclusion criteria. In total, ten studies reported significant negative effects between the two domains, of which only six reported effect sizes that could be considered meaningful. All but two reported these effects in the direction of early externalizing behavior problems to later academic achievement. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence for either a causal or predictive relationship. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.",Tara Kulkarni,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-9C2-1D9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-9C2-1D9,2020-07-15,2020-08-19T15:52:37+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Consultation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention; latent class growth analysis; trajectories; problem behavior; externalizing; academic achievement; schools,False
245,"Social isolation, mental health, and use of digital interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative survey","Summary Background: Public health measures to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates may have negative psychosocial consequences in youth. Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We investigated the associations between social isolation, cognitive preoccupation, worries, and anxiety, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as use of, and attitude towards, mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the ‘Mental Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey’ —a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Outcomes: Overall, 38% of youth met criteria for moderate psychological distress and 30% felt ‘often’ or ‘very often’ socially isolated, even after most restrictive infection control measures had been lifted. Social isolation, COVID-19-related worries and anxiety, and objective risk indicators were associated with psychological distress, with evidence of dose-response relationships for some of these associations. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of social isolation increased (reporting ‘never’ as reference group: ‘occasionally’: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9·1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4·3 – 19·1, p<0·001; ‘often’: aOR 22·2, CI 9·8 – 50·2, p<0·001;’very often’: aOR 42·3, CI 14·1 – 126·8, p<0·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas high levels of psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with actual use. Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with poor mental health in youth. Digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact given there is an objective need and subjective demand.",Christian Rauschenberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395,2020-06-29,2020-08-18T15:30:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; social isolation; public mental health; youth mental health; mhealth; social risk; worrying; covid-19,False
246,"Measuring COVID-19 Fear in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity. Differences in the performance of the Fear of Infection and Existential Threat scales are considered in terms of the respective objective and subjective nature of the constructs.",Francesca Eileen Collins,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C,2020-07-06,2020-08-18T02:07:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; international students; australia; nepal; india; australian; university students; mental health; covid-19; contagion-related fear; scale validation; covid-19-related fear; nepali; fear; indian,False
247,Is self-reported social distancing susceptible to social desirability bias? Using the crosswise model to elicit sensitive behaviors,"Sensitive behaviors such as self-reported performance or (un)ethical behaviors often carry strong social connotations of appropriate or inappropriate conduct. In return, social norms can artificially inflate or deflate individuals’ responses and bias scientific results on their prevalence and effects. As a core part of governments’ mitigation strategy against the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing might represent one of these behaviors. Can researchers expect honest responses when surveying citizens about their social distancing behaviors? This question is examined using the sensitive survey technique, “the crosswise model”, to elicit aggregate-level prevalence estimates of (1) self-reported social distancing, and (2) honest reporting in a prediction dice game. Since the number of wins in the dice game follows a known probability distribution, it offers an excellent setting for illustrating the utility of the crosswise model before applying it to self-reported social distancing. In a survey of 1,059 adults living in the US, the crosswise model outperforms direct questioning in revealing respondents’ dishonest behavior in the dice game. While the crosswise model also indicates some social desirability bias when asking respondents directly about their social distancing behaviors, the extent of this bias seems small and does not appear to overtly inflate individuals’ self-reported measures of social distancing.",Ulrich Jensen,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-52B-CF5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-52B-CF5,2020-08-14,2020-08-14T15:58:24+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; social desirability bias; covid-19; social distancing; sensitive survey technique,False

249,Stay at Home! When Personality Profiles Influence Psychological Adjustment and Creativity during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objectives. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to “stay at home”. Although research suggests that social isolation affects health and wellbeing, reactions may vary depending on individuals, and more specifically their preference for solitude. The present study also aimed to identify personality profiles and how they may be associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. Design. The study employed a cross-sectional survey design. Methods. French respondents (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in Spring 2020. The questionnaire comprised sociodemographic variables (age, gender, educational level and occupation), information on lockdown conditions (type of accommodation, living alone or with family, and frequency of face-to-face and online contacts), measures of psychological adjustment (stress, anxiety and loneliness) and performance on a series of creative tasks. Results. Based on measures of individuals’ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, a latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with “Affiliation” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a convergent creative thinking task. Conclusions. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns. With this knowledge, health professionals and public health policies should develop appropriate interventions to accompany high-risk individuals in situations of social isolation.",Estelle Michinov et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,2020-06-22,2020-08-13T16:05:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social isolation; covid-19; creativity; personality profiles; preference for solitude,False
