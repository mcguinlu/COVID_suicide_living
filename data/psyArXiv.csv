0,A Week During COVID-19: Online Social Interactions Predict Greater Connection and More Stress,"Who thrives while socially distancing? For this descriptive, exploratory study, we polled a sample of over 500 participants from the United States on April 8, 2020—in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when practicing social distancing was at its peak. Above and beyond other social and nonsocial activities, living and employment arrangements, personality traits, demographics, and other variables, people who spent more time interacting with close others—either in person or online—felt more socially connected. However, only interacting with close others in person, but not online, predicted greater positive affect. In contrast, people who spent more time interacting with weak ties online experienced greater negative affect and more stress. Looking at specific interaction partners, we found that people who interacted with their relatives, romantic partners, and even coworkers/classmates felt more socially connected. Living arrangements mattered little beyond people’s social interactions, except for living with one’s children, which predicted greater stress. Certain social online activities, including playing games with close ties and group/club meetings predicted greater positive affect. Amongst nonsocial activities, active leisure like exercise emerged as a robust predictor of positive affect, whereas passive leisure like watching TV predicted greater negative affect. Even during a historic pandemic and unprecedented conditions of social distancing, then, the factors that predict well-being are much the same as those already established in the literature. Indeed, much like in-person interactions, online social interactions predict greater social connectedness. However, unlike in-person interactions, online interactions simultaneously predict more negative affect and more stress.",Maureen Tibbetts et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F1-B2B-540,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F1-B2B-540,2021-01-01,2021-01-01T04:34:44+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid19; happiness; computer-mediated communication; affect; social distancing; subjective well-being; positive affect; social interactions; pandemic",False

2,Pregnancy during the pandemic: The impact of COVID-19-related stress on risk for prenatal depression,"Pregnant women may be particularly sensitive to negative events (i.e., adversity) related to the COVID-19 pandemic and affective responses to these events (i.e., stress). We examined COVID-19-related stress and adversity in a sample of 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March-May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses in California that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk factors. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic had substantially elevated depressive symptoms compared to matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Several individual- and community-level risk and protective factors were associated with women’s scores on two latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity. Highlighting the role of subjective responses to the pandemic in vulnerability to prenatal depression and factors that influence susceptibility to COVID-19-related stress, these findings inform understanding of the psychosocial sequelae of disease outbreaks among pregnant women.",Lucy S King et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46063-4F2-71A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46063-4F2-71A,2020-12-31,2020-12-31T23:07:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Natural Environments; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; pregnancy; depression; stress; covid-19; adversity,False
3,Statistical Significance Filtering Overestimates Effects and Impedes Falsification: A Critique of Endsley (2019),"Whether in meta-analysis or single experiments, selecting results based on statistical significance leads to overestimated effect sizes, impeding falsification. We critique a quantitative synthesis that used significance to score and select previously published effects for situation awareness-performance associations (Endsley, 2019). How much does selection using statistical significance quantitatively impact results in a meta-analytic context? We evaluate and compare results using significance-filtered effects versus analyses with all effects as-reported. Endsley reported high predictiveness scores and large positive mean correlations but used atypical methods: the hypothesis was used to select papers and effects. Papers were assigned the maximum predictiveness scores if they contained at-least-one significant effect, yet most papers reported multiple effects, and the number of non-significant effects did not impact the score. Thus, the predictiveness score was rarely less than the maximum. In addition, only significant effects were included in Endsley’s quantitative synthesis. Filtering excluded half of all reported effects, with guaranteed minimum effect sizes based on sample size. Results for filtered compared to as-reported effects clearly diverged. Compared to the mean of as-reported effects, the filtered mean was overestimated by 56%. Furthermore, 92% (or 222 out of 241) of the as-reported effects were below the mean of filtered effects. We conclude that outcome-dependent selection of effects is circular, predetermining results and running contrary to the purpose of meta-analysis. Instead of using significance to score and filter effects, meta-analyses should follow established research practices.",Jonathan Z Bakdash et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-6A0-148,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-6A0-148,2020-09-25,2020-12-31T15:05:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; psychology; validity; human factors; meta-analysis; cognitive psychology; confirmation bias; significance filter; situation awareness; p-hacking; falsification; experimental psychology; selection bias; performance; inference,False
4,Impact of a Single School-Based Intervention for COVID-19 on Improving Mental Health,"An underlying concern about the COVID-19 pandemic is that the mental health of children will decline. The present study aimed to investigate whether a single school-based intervention, including self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19, effectively achieved its aim to promote children’s mental health. The study was conducted in a junior high school. We assigned the third grade as the intervention group, second grade as the announcement group, and first grade, the control group. We hypothesized that the intervention group would experience improved mental health and reduced fear of COVID-19, when compared to the announcement and control groups. Interaction effects were observed only for depression, indicating a significant intervention effect in the intervention group. These findings suggest that a single school-based intervention that includes self-monitoring and psychoeducation for COVID-19 can help to improve children’s mental health. It is suggested that school-based interventions that intend to raise children's awareness of COVID-19 promote healthy development and adaptation within the school.",Takahiro Kubo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-657-288,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-657-288,2020-12-31,2020-12-31T13:45:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention,False
5,What drives beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories? The role of psychotic-like experiences and confinement-related factors,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide threat to public health and the global economy. The climate of fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic has fostered the emergence of a wide-range of COVID-19 conspiracy theories that has the potential do shape public opinion and hinder the effective dissemination of valid information. Beliefs in conspiracy theories has been associated with maladaptive personality traits such as schizotypy and paranoia, as well as other non-psychotic psychological characteristics (e.g., social isolation, stress). The current study aimed to examine the association between beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and psychotic-like experiences within the community, while also addressing the role of sociodemographic information, psychological outcomes (e.g., stress, affective states) and other pandemic-related factors (e.g., confinement conditions/behaviors). Our results suggest that psychotic-like experiences are associated with beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, particularly perceptual abnormalities and persecutory ideation. Moreover, increased health-related concerns and reduced education levels also seem to be liability factors for these conspiracy beliefs. These results add important insights into how the adherence to illogical and erroneous disease-related arguments may be contingent to proneness to psychotic-like experiences. COVID-19 conspiracy theories are yet another major challenge that governments and policy makers must contemplate when defining strategic directions to manage the current and future pandemics.",Simão Pedro Rodrigues Ferreira et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613E-EA0-397,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613E-EA0-397,2020-12-31,2020-12-31T11:56:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; conspiracy theories; psychosis; conspiracy belief; covid-19; confinement; pandemic,False
6,"A Cognitive Coping Model of Reinforcement Sensitivity, Emotion Regulation, and Affective Psychopathology: Cross-sectional, Longitudinal and Quasi-Experimental Evidence","Temperamental reinforcement sensitivity predicts affective pathology, with BAS sensitivity negatively predicting depression and BIS sensitivity positively predicting both depression and anxiety. Most clinical research on reinforcement sensitivity, however, neglects the role of cognitive mechanisms in mediating these relationships. The current article presents a cognitive coping model of clinical reinforcement sensitivity wherein the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity and affective pathology is mediated by trait preferences for corollary emotion regulation strategies. In Study 1, participants (N = 593) completed measures of reinforcement sensitivity, positive reappraisal, rumination, depression, and anxiety. Exploratory structural equation modeling found that the only model with a good fit included BAS sensitivity predicting reappraisal and BIS sensitivity negatively predicting it. Reappraisal then negatively predicted depression. BIS sensitivity also predicted rumination, which predicted both depression and anxiety. Study 2a confirmed the model developed in Study 1 with an independent sample (N = 513). It then examined longitudinal relationships with a second assessment 6 months later. The relationship from BIS sensitivity to rumination to depression and anxiety remained significant, as did the relationship between reappraisal and depression. Reinforcement sensitivity, however, did not predict reappraisal. In Study 2b, participants (N = 219) were assessed a third time one year later, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this stressful time, BAS sensitivity did longitudinally predict reappraisal. These studies highlight the role of emotion regulation in mediating the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity and affective pathology, particularly during times of high stress.",Benjamin A Katz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-253-A07,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-253-A07,2020-12-21,2020-12-31T09:40:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; transdiagnostic; reward sensitivity; covid-19; emotion regulation; reinforcement sensitivity; diathesis stress; punishment sensitivity; anxiety,False
7,Mechanisms of Parental Stress During and After the COVID-19 Lockdown: A two-wave longitudinal study,"Background: In the unpredictable times of the ongoing global coronavirus disease (COVID-19), parents worldwide are affected by stressors and strains that follow in the wake of the government-initiated distancing protocols. Objective: In a two‐wave longitudinal survey, we examined levels of parental perceived stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression among a sample of parents at two time points; in the midst of the strictest government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2868) and three months after the protocols discontinued (T2, n = 1489). Further, we investigated the levels of parental stress, anxiety, and depression relative to perceived relationship quality and anger aimed at child(ren) at the two time points, including subgroups based on age, sex, cultural background, civil status, education level, number of children in household, employment status, and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Methods and findings: Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement occasions. As expected, the findings indicate that the high levels of parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stressors that parent’s experiences during distancing protocols declined as a function of the phaseout of the protocols. The decrease of perceived parental stress at the two time points, was accompanied by a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-off for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% respectively at T2. Reduction in depression and angry at child(ren) from T1 to T2 were further associated with a reduction in perceived parental stress. In addition, relationship quality and angry at child(ren) at T1 predicted change in parental stress. Conclusions: The findings underline some of the negative psychological impact of physical distancing protocols on parent’s health and well-being. Parents who are facing physical distancing and remaining at home with their children may be particularly vulnerable to parental stress, anxiety and depression. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated to parents and families facing social crisis, such as the ongoing pandemic, can contribute to design relevant interventions to reduce parental stress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.

8,Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions,"The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their child’s schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.",Lisa B Thorell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D6-4ED-930,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D6-4ED-930,2020-09-25,2020-12-30T11:08:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; mental health problems; covid-19; homeschooling; psychosocial effects,False
9,Connected Despite COVID-19: The Role of Social Interactions and Social Media for Wellbeing,"Physical distancing is crucial for slowing the spread of COVID-19, but the associated reduction of social interaction can be detrimental to psychological wellbeing. Here, we sought to understand whether different ways in which people connect to others might mitigate this negative impact. We examined how amount and type of social interactions and social media use would predict wellbeing during a period of physical distancing in the United Kingdom. In a 30-day diary study conducted in April-June 2020, 108 participants reported their daily social interactions and social media use, as well as their end-of-day wellbeing. Using multilevel regressions, we found that more face-to-face interactions positively predicted wellbeing, while technology-mediated communication had less consistent positive effects on wellbeing. More active and less passive social media use was associated with greater wellbeing. Our results suggest that while technology-mediated communication can improve wellbeing, face-to-face interactions are unique and important for wellbeing during physical distancing.",Rui Sun et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-55F-912,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-55F-912,2020-12-30,2020-12-30T08:45:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; social media; physical distancing; wellbeing; social interactions,False
10,Development of an intervention to increase adherence to nebuliser treatment in adults with Cystic Fibrosis: CFHealthHub,"Background Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition in which daily therapies to maintain lung health are critical yet treatment adherence is low. Previous interventions to increase adherence have been largely unsuccessful and this is likely due to a lack of focus on behavioural evidence and theory alongside input from people with CF. This intervention is based on a digital platform that collects and displays objective nebuliser adherence data. The purpose of this paper is to identify the specific components of an intervention to increase and maintain adherence to nebuliser treatments in adults with CF with a focus on reducing effort and treatment burden. Methods Intervention development was informed by the behaviour change wheel (BCW) and Person-Based Approach (PBA). A multidisciplinary team conducted qualitative research to inform a needs analysis, selected and refined intervention components and methods of delivery, mapped adherence-related barriers and facilitators, associated intervention functions, and behaviour change techniques, and utilised iterative feedback to develop and refine content and processes. Results Results indicated that people with CF need to understand their treatment, be able to monitor adherence, have treatment goals and feedback, confidence in their ability to adhere, to have a treatment plan to develop habits for treatment, and be able to solve problems around treatment adherence. Behaviour change techniques were selected to address each of these needs and were incorporated into the digital intervention developed iteratively, alongside a manual and training for health professionals. Feedback from people with CF and clinicians helped to refine the intervention which could be tailored to individual patient needs. Conclusions The intervention development process is underpinned by a strong theoretical framework and evidence base and was developed by a multidisciplinary team with a range of skills and expertise integrated with substantial input from patients and clinicians. This multifaceted development strategy has ensured that the intervention is usable and acceptable to people with CF and clinicians, providing the best chance of success in supporting people with CF with different needs to increase and maintain their adherence. The intervention is being tested in a randomised controlled trial across 19 UK sites.",Madelynne Arden et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606C-F62-3F5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606C-F62-3F5,2020-12-29,2020-12-29T19:33:28+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment,False
11,Information concerning others more than individual variables modulates interpersonal distance in the times of COVID-19 pandemic: a bayesian analysis approach,"Creating and maintaining bonds in humans typically comes with interactions occurring at close social distances which are usually shorter than the one (of at least 1.5 meters) recommended as a relevant measure of COVID-19 contagion containment. In a web-based experimental study conducted during the first pandemic wave (mid-April 2020), we asked 242 participants to regulate their preferred distance towards confederates who did or did not wear protective mask/gloves and who could have tested positive or negative to COVID-19 or whose test results are unknown. Information concerning the dispositional factors (perceived vulnerability to disease, moral attitudes and prosocial tendencies) and situational factors (perceived severity of the situation in the country, frequency of physical and virtual social contacts and attitudes toward quarantine) that may modulate compliance with safety prescriptions was also acquired. A bayesian analysis approach was adopted. Individual differences did not modulate the interpersonal distance. We found strong evidence in favor of a reduction of interpersonal distance towards characters wearing protective equipment and who tested negative to Covid-19. Importantly, shorter interpersonal distances were kept towards confederates wearing protections, even when their test result was unknown or turned out positive to Covid-19. The protective equipment-related regulation of interpersonal distance may reflect an underestimation of the perceived vulnerability to the infection, which has to be discouraged when pursuing individual and collective safety.",Matteo Lisi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607F-840-819,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607F-840-819,2020-12-23,2020-12-29T14:42:28+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; risk of infection; personal protective equipment; covid-19; interpersonal distance",False
12,Propensity to reappraise promotes resilience to stress-induced negativity bias,"Stress exposure is associated with an increased tendency to appraise ambiguous social stimuli as negative. However, it remains unknown whether tendencies to use emotion regulation strategies—such as cognitive reappraisal, which involves altering the meaning of affective stimuli—can buffer these stress effects on social evaluations. Here, we examined whether increased reappraisal use confers resilience against stress-induced negativity bias. In Study 1, healthy participants (n=43) rated the valence of emotionally ambiguous (surprised) faces before and after an acute stress or control manipulation and reported reappraisal habits. Increased negativity ratings were milder for stressed individuals that reported more habitual reappraisal use. In Study 2 (n=97), we extended this investigation to real-world perceived stress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that reappraisal tendency moderates the relationship between perceived stress and increased negativity bias. Collectively, these findings suggest that the propensity to reappraise attenuates stress-induced negativity bias when evaluating others under uncertainty.",Candace Raio et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C0-163-89B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C0-163-89B,2020-12-28,2020-12-29T08:57:05+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other",False

14,Nine Months in the Life of a College Student During 2020: A Case Study Using Multi-Modal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of Well-being,"Emerging adulthood is a period marked by tremendous growth and opportunity, but also of significant risk. It is during this phase that the majority of major disease processes have their onset and also the time during which individuals develop habits for adaptive ways of managing stress and help-seeking when necessary. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of estimating stress levels through monitoring of physiological signs of sympathetic nervous system activity (e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, galvanic skin response, etc.) using wearable devices. However, this method of objective monitoring only captures changes in internal states but not the contextual factors – such as mental activity and social interactions – that are critical for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental health problems that may follow from the long-term effects of stress. Thus, there is a fundamental need to capture higher-level life events and contextual information to enable root cause analysis for treatment and prevention. The proposed case study is part of a larger pilot study in which we intensely follow a small sample of college students over the course of 9-months during an historic and tumultuous year in which COVID-19 disrupted daily living to understand contextual factors relevant to their mental health while capturing mood, sleep, physical activity, and physiology.

15,"Measuring COVID-19 Fear and Threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity.

17,"Receipt, spending, and clinical correlates of economic impact payments among middle and low-income U.S. adults","This study examined characteristics and planned expenses of U.S. adults who received the economic impact payment (EIP) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using a nationally representative sample of 6,607 low and middle-income U.S. adults, this study examined the proportion and correlates of EIP receipt among eligible adults; and associations between planned expenses using the EIP, problems paying expenses, and clinical characteristics. In the total sample, 79% reported they received the EIP and 82% of recipients reported the EIP had a positive impact on their life. Being a veteran (OR= 2.59), married (OR= 1.82), with a history of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (OR= 1.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR= 1.51), and screening negative for recent suicidal ideation (OR= 0.49) were associated with EIP receipt. Planned expenses using the EIP for savings, paying debt, and rent accounted for 63% of the total amount. Greater planned expenses on substance use or gambling were correlated with lower rated impact of the EIP on life. Additionally, EIP receipt was associated with fewer problems paying daily expenses, but participants who screened positive for mental health or alcohol use problems were more likely to report problems paying daily expenses in the past month. Together, these findings suggest unconditional cash transfers, like the EIP, are important for low and middle-income populations to sustain their living situation. The management of funds are important to consider, especially among those experiencing mental health problems, and may represent opportunities for financial literacy and money management interventions.",Jack Tsai et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46171-D18-0CB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46171-D18-0CB,2020-12-28,2020-12-28T04:00:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental illness; economic impact payment; stimulus; coronavirus,False
18,"Change in mental and physical health, and social relationships, during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Australia","In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020. Our survey (n = 1599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Therefore, the psychological toll on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater COVID-19 infection rates. Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (~68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.",Shane L.

19,A Path from Collective Threat to Eudaimonia: Mediating Role of Awe,"How do people react to collective threats such as natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic? Magnificent catastrophic events might have an impact on emotions of not only those who experienced direct harm from it but also those who feel threat without actual harm. The current study demonstrated that such threat enhances self-transcendent values that further leads to general well-being, mediated by the emotion of awe. Two surveys were conducted immediately after a severe typhoon hit Japan (Study 1) and during the early phases of the COVID-19 spread in Japan (Study 2). Predisposition to feel negative awe predicted participants’ attention to both collective threat events, which led to an affirmation of self-transcendent values and general well-being. Furthermore, when participants were asked to recall a collective threat (vs. control event), they felt more awe which led to more engaged meaning making during the event, in turn predicting their affirmation of self-transcendent values.",Masataka Nakayama et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-68A-58A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DE-68A-58A,2020-12-26,2020-12-26T07:02:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; eudaimonia; self-transcendence; awe; collective threat; well-being,False
20,Rock ’n’ Roll but not Sex or Drugs: Music is negatively correlated to depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic via reward-related mechanisms,"The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected mental health. We assessed which of many leisure activities had positive psychological effects, with particular attention to music, which has been reported anecdotally to be important. Questionnaire data from over a thousand individuals primarily from Italy, Spain, and the USA during spring 2020 show that people picked music most often as the best activity to cope with psychological distress. Hours of engagement in music and food-related activities during the pandemic were associated with decreased depression symptoms. The benefits of music were mediated by individual differences in sensitivity to reward, whereas the positive effects of food-related activities were related to emotion regulation. Our results demonstrate that music is an important means of improving well-being, and suggest that the underlying mechanism is related to reward, consistent with neuroscience findings. Our data have practical significance in pointing to effective strategies to cope with mental health issues.",Ernest Mas-Herrero et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EB-A98-5D4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EB-A98-5D4,2020-12-22,2020-12-26T04:31:09+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; music; mental health; reward; covid-19,False
21,Disassociating conformity driven and self-interest driven dishonest behaviors,"Dishonest behavior can be driven by both self-interest and social learning towards the external environment. However, whether and how these two processes (conformity-driven and self-interest-driven dishonesty) relate and interact to influence dishonest acts remains unknown. In the current research, we propose a computational model consisting of these two dishonesty processes. The results of the agent-based simulation modeling and experimental studies revealed that self-interest driven-dishonesty propensity determined the extent of dishonesty when one was in pursuit of self-interests, while the effect of dishonesty conformity on dishonesty was dependent on both the self and environmental dishonesty propensity. In addition, self-interest-driven dishonesty propensity was related to individuals’ preference for value allocation, while dishonesty conformity was related to the belief in environmental predictability. In cross-cultural contexts, these two processes of dishonesty exert distinct effects on participants’ tendency to violate the regulation rules of the local government and impacted the development of the local prevalence of pathogens during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of the current in-depth research validate the processes of conformity-driven and self-interest-driven dishonesty when dishonest behaviors emerged and to uncover how these two processes influenced the progression of a real-life emergent event.",Nora Huang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605C-261-866,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605C-261-866,2020-12-24,2020-12-24T07:27:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence,False
22,Monthly prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico,"Abstract Objective: Estimate the prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from April to June 2020. Methods: Repeated cross-sections design based in the ENCOVID-19 – a series of monthly mobile surveys with representative samples of Mexico (N= 833- 1,674). The questionnaire includes the GAD-2 scale, and, in July, the GAD-7 scale was added; we examined its internal validity with confirmatory factor analysis and its concurrent validity with sociodemographic variables. Using GAD-7 as criterion, we analyzed the predictive validity of the GAD-2. We estimated the monthly prevalence with the GAD-2. Results: The GAD-7 and the GAD-2 are reliable and valid. The GAD-2 has a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.90. The monthly prevalence remains high and stable, between 30.7 and 32.6%. GAD concentrated in women, unemployed and persons with low socioeconomic status. Conclusions: GAD is a public health problem that worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

23,National identity predicts public health support during a global pandemic: Results from 67 nations,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a devastating global health crisis. Without a vaccine or effective medication, the best hope for mitigating virus transmission is collective behavior change and support for public health interventions (e.g., physical distancing, physical hygiene, and endorsement of health policies). In a large-scale international collaboration (N = 46,450 across 67 countries), we investigated why people adopted public health behaviors and endorsed public policy interventions (e.g., closing bars and restaurants) during the early stages of the pandemic (April-May, 2020). Results revealed that respondents who identified more strongly with their nation consistently reported engagement in public health behaviors and greater support for public health policies. We also found a small effect of political orientation, indicating that left-wing respondents were more likely to report public health behaviors and support for public health measures than right-wing respondents.

24,Remo measurement system: Development of a measuring system to assert on-water rowing performance,"In crew rowing movement synchronisation is generally regarded as one of the main determinants of optimal performance. In my dissertation “Coordination dynamics of crew rowing” I conducted various studies to investigate rowers’ ability to coordinate their movements, both in traditional synchronised (in-phase) and the more innovative antiphase rowing, during which the rowers alternate their strokes (Cuijpers, 2019). To be able to measure crew coordination and the movements of the boat on-water, I developed a measurement system using open-source computer hardware and software that allows building digital devices and interactive objects. The aim of this method paper is to provide insight in how this measurement system was developed and build.

25,Pandemic panic? Results of a 6-month longitudinal study on fear of COVID-19,"Fear is an evolutionary adaptive emotion that serves to protect the organism from harm. Once a threat diminishes, fear should also dissipate as otherwise fear may become chronic and pathological. While threat (i.e., number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths) during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has substantially varied over time, it remains unclear whether fear has followed a similar pattern. To examine the development of fear of COVID-19 and investigate potential predictors for chronic fear, we conducted a large online longitudinal study (N = 2000) using the Prolific platform. Participants represented unselected residents of 34 different countries. The Fear of the Coronavirus Questionnaire (FCQ) and several other demographic and psychological measures were completed monthly between March and August 2020. Overall, we find that fear steadily decreased after a peak in April 2020.

26,Perceived risk factors for severe Covid-19 symptoms and their association with health behaviours: Findings from the HEBECO study,"Background: There remains uncertainty about Covid-19 risk factors. We examined UK adults’ risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 symptoms and whether engaging in concurrent health behaviours is associated with risk perceptions. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the HEBECO study where 2206 UK adults classified potential factors (age 70+, ethnic minority, medical comorbidities, vaping, smoking cigarettes, alcohol drinking, regular physical activity, being overweight, eating unhealthy foods, using nicotine replacement therapy – NRT, lower income, poor housing, being a keyworker) as either increasing, decreasing, or having no impact on severe Covid-19 symptoms. Logistic regressions examined whether engaging in health behaviours was associated with risk perceptions after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, health conditions and other behaviours. Results: The great majority (89-99%) of adults classified age 70+, having comorbidities, being a key worker, overweight, and from an ethnic minority as increasing the risk. People were less sure about alcohol drinking, vaping, and nicotine replacement therapy use (17.4-29.5% responding ‘don’t know’). Relative to those who did not, those who smoked tobacco, vaped and consumed alcohol had significantly (all p<0.015) higher odds (aORs=1.58 to 5.80) for classifying these behaviours as ‘no impact’ or ‘decreasing risk’, and lower odds (aORs=.25 to .72) for classifying as ‘increasing risk’. Similarly, eating more fruit and vegetables was associated with classifying unhealthy diet as ‘increasing risk’ (aOR=1.37,1.12-1.69), and exercising more with classifying regular physical activity as ‘decreasing risk’ (aOR=2.42,1.75-3.34). Conclusions: Risk perceptions for severe Covid-19 symptoms were lower for adults’ own health behaviours, evidencing optimism bias. Implications: These risk perceptions may form barriers to changing one’s own unhealthy behaviours or make one less responsive to interventions that refer to the risk of Covid-19 as a motivating factor. Thus, in some cases risk perceptions could help sustain unhealthy behaviours and exacerbate inequalities in health behaviours and outcomes.",Aleksandra Herbec et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-5B7-F6C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-5B7-F6C,2020-12-20,2020-12-22T16:41:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; cross-sectional; health behaviours; covid-19; optimism bias; health behaviors; risk perceptions,False

Further, international states and organizations have claimed an increase in IPV numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, raising awareness of the potential causes and providing urgent recommendations and guidelines to follow for the containment and possible interventions. Based on these priorities, this review aims to explore and analyze the existing scientific literature on the association and consequences of COVID-19 on Domestic Violence and to sum up the strategies and recommendations for clinicians and health care workers. Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus and Science of Direct were searched. Papers published between 2019 and 2020, written in English and having as main focus the domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, were included. Results: At the final stage, 60 articles were included and analyzed. Results pointed three pre-determined categories: the course, the dynamics, the recommendations and an adjunctive category DV and disasters.

28,"The network structure of stress-related states, depression, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown","Background. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the social distancing protocols used to impede the spread of the virus may have severe mental health consequences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the network of components of pandemic-related negative psychological states (i.e., fear of infection, financial worries, loneliness) and symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Methods. Data from 10,061 Norwegian adults recruited through an online survey during a period of strict social distancing protocols were analyzed employing a cross-sectional Gaussian Graphical Model. Results. Of the infection fears, fear of being infected, fear of dying from the coronavirus and fear of significant others dying from it had notable connections to the GAD symptoms anxiety and/or fear of awful events. The financial worry component worry about personal economy was connected to the MDD symptom sleep problems and to the GAD symptom generalized worry. Each of the loneliness components was connected to a specific MDD symptom. Anhedonia, depressed mood and worthlessness had the highest strength centrality among the MDD symptoms; generalized worry, uncontrollability of worry, and trouble relaxing among the GAD symptoms; fear of dying from the virus among the fear of infection components; and feeling isolated among the loneliness components. A community analysis identified separate clusters for MDD and GAD as well as a cluster cutting across the two disorders. Conclusions. Particular components of the pandemic-related distressing states of fear of infection and loneliness seem to be associated with specific symptoms of MDD and GAD.

29,Revisiting the role of financial motives in disordered gambling: A meta-analytic review,"Aims: Money is central to psychological definitions of gambling, but contemporary accounts of disordered gambling are ambiguous regarding the role of financial motives for gambling. The aims of the current research were to obtain meta-analytic weighted effect sizes for zero-order associations of financial motives against disordered gambling and gambling frequency, as well as partial associations after controlling for other motives (e.g. coping). Design: A meta-analysis of the available literature through October 2019 was undertaken. Studies were identified from multiple sources (e.g., database search, consulting other researchers). PRISMA standards were followed when screening identified records and extracting relevant data. The data analytic plan was pre-registered. Setting: Cross-sectional studies that involved student, community, and clinical samples of people who gamble. Participants: Forty-one studies were included with 32,997 participants from different countries. Measurements: Validated self-report measures of financial motives for gambling alongside measures of either problem gambling and/or gambling frequency. Findings: Financial motives for gambling were positively associated with both disordered gambling, r = .34, [.30, .38], p =1.04e-61, and gambling frequency, r = .29, [.20, .37], p = 1.70e-13, with moderate effect sizes. The partial associations after controlling for overlapping variance with other gambling motives were also positive (disordered gambling: β = .18, [.14, .23], p = 2.53e-15; gambling frequency: β = .16, [.08, .24], p = 9.45e-5), with small-to-moderate effect sizes. The effect sizes were heterogenous and the extent of heterogeneity was high. Moderator analyses of the zero-order association involving gambling frequency indicated that effect sizes were larger for studies that used the Gambling Motives Questionnaire-Financial relative to studies that developed their own gambling motives measure. No further moderators were statistically significant.

30,Optimizing COVID-19 Health Campaigns: A Person-Centered Approach,"As the United States continues to be ravaged by COVID-19, it becomes increasingly important to implement effective public health campaigns to improve personal behaviors that help control the spread of the virus. To design effective campaigns, research is needed to understand the current mitigation intentions of the general public, diversity in those intentions, and theoretical predictors of them. COVID-19 campaigns will be particularly challenging because mitigation involves myriad, diverse behaviors. This study takes a person-centered approach to investigate data from a survey (N = 976) of Pennsylvania adults. Latent class analysis revealed five classes of mitigation: one marked by complete adherence with health recommendations (34% of the sample), one by complete refusal (9% of the sample), and three by a mixture of adherence and refusal. Statistically significant covariates of class membership included relatively negative injunctive norms, risk due to essential workers in the household, personal knowledge of someone who became infected with COVID-19, and belief that COVID-19 was a leaked biological weapon. Additionally, trait reactance was associated with non-adherence while health mavenism was associated with adherence. These findings may be used to good effect by local healthcare providers and institutions, and also inform broader policy-making decisions regarding public health campaigns to mitigate COVID-19.",Rachel Smith et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-062-C6C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-062-C6C,2020-12-18,2020-12-22T16:06:01+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; injunctive norms; covid-19; audience analysis; risk; mitigation; latent class analysis,False
31,Different conspiracy theories have different psychological and social determinants: Comparison of three theories about the origins of the COVID-19 virus in a representative sample of the UK population,"Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 have proliferated during the global pandemic, and their rapid spread among certain groups in the population has important implications for policy attitudes (e.g., motivation to engage in social distancing and willingness to vaccinate). Using survey data from two waves of a nationally representative, longitudinal study of life in lockdown in the UK (N = 1,406), we analyze the factors associated with belief in three theories related to COVID-19, namely that it 1) originated in a meat market in Wuhan, China, 2) was developed in a lab in Wuhan, China, and 3) is caused by 5G mobile networks. Using a dual-factor model, we test how cognitive ability and motivations affect susceptibility to misinformation. Our findings suggest that motivational and political dispositions, as well as the sources from which people derive COVID-19 related information, are strongly associated with belief in conspiracy theories about the virus, though these predictors vary among conspiracies. Belief in the Chinese lab conspiracy is associated with right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and a preference for tabloid newspapers, while belief in the 5G network origin story is associated with social dominance orientation and a tendency to derive information on COVID-19 from social media. Moreover, we find that motivational factors like RWA and SDO have larger effect sizes than COVID-19 related anxiety, a desire for certainty, cognitive reasoning ability, or even general conspiracy ideation (in the case of 5G belief). These findings suggest that efforts to mitigate the potential damage caused by conspiracy theories, for example, by increasing education and awareness, may be inadequate because they miss a larger story, namely the role that politically motivated reasoning plays in making individuals susceptible to misinformation, and the propagation of conspiracies through networks and channels that reinforce these inaccurate worldviews.",Todd K.

32,Delay discounting and under-valuing of recent information predict lower adherence to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the day-to-day behaviours of populations globally, especially in areas where social distancing rules have been mandated. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying (un)successful behaviour change around social distancing is crucial to inform public health policy for both the current and future crises. In this study, we utilise tasks probing delay discounting (the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards) and patch foraging (evaluating the trade-off between exploiting a known resource and exploring an unknown one) to investigate cognitive predictors of social distancing and mental health symptoms. Participants (N=442) were recruited from a large UK cohort (N=2025) nationally representative in age, gender and income. Greater sensitivity to reward magnitude during delay discounting predicted lower adherence to social distancing measures and higher levels of mood and anxiety symptoms. In addition, under-valuing recently sampled information during foraging separately predicted greater violation of social distancing. Analyses examining cognitive factors underpinning social distancing behaviour across two time points (early and late phases of the pandemic) additionally revealed that greater sensitivity to magnitude of rewards on offer during delay discounting predicted a greater decline in psychological inclination to maintain social distancing. Moreover, under-valuing recent information during foraging separately predicted less motivation to engage in social distancing during the established phase of the pandemic. The findings suggest that those who typically regulate their mood through behaviours that bring about immediate reward are also those who struggle to maintain social distancing. Further, those who adapt more quickly to new information showed better ability to change their behaviour in response to public health measures. These findings highlight the need for public health initiatives that bolster sustained confidence in planning around social distancing by emphasising the immediate rewards to self as well as longer term benefits.",Alex Lloyd et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782,2020-09-22,2020-12-22T15:04:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; decision-making; coronavirus; patch; social distancing; covid-19; delay discounting; foraging,False
33,Fearing the Disease or the Vaccine: The Case of COVID-19,"Objective: As COVID-19 continues to spread, researchers are working to develop a safe and effective vaccine. The success of an approved vaccine in stopping or slowing the pandemic will ultimately depend on the public’s acceptance of it. As studies indicate that people perceive COVID-19 as a threatening disease, the demand for a vaccine could be expected to be high. However, vaccine safety concerns might still outweigh the perceived disease risks in a decision to vaccinate against COVID-19. In the present paper, the role of perceived risk of COVID-19 (i.e., perceived likelihood of infection, perceived disease severity, and disease-related worry) and trust in the safety of a prospective vaccine against COVID-19 in predicting intentions to accept a COVID-19 vaccine was investigated. Methods: Three Finnish samples were surveyed: 856 parents of small children, 205 individuals living in an area with suboptimal vaccination coverage, and 1,325 Facebook users nationwide. As points of reference, we compared the perceptions of COVID-19 to those of influenza and measles. Results: COVID-19 was perceived as a threatening disease—more so than influenza and measles. The strongest predictor of COVID-19 vaccination intentions was trusting the safety of the potential vaccine. Those perceiving COVID-19 as a severe disease were also slightly more intent on taking a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: If a vaccine against COVID-19 is successfully developed, assuring the public that the vaccine is safe should be the focus for health authorities aiming to achieve a high vaccine uptake.",Linnea Karlsson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615E-B72-B38,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615E-B72-B38,2020-09-29,2020-12-21T22:28:40+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; covid-19; vaccination; perceived disease risk; perceived vaccine safety; vaccination intentions; vaccine hesitancy,False
34,Harnessing shared identities to mobilise resilient responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,"Shared social identifications (family, community, nation, humanity) predict normative actions and psychological well-being, and can be invoked discursively by leaders to mobilise their followers. We illustrate the potential for harnessing shared identities to mobilise resilient public responses against COVID-19. Study 1, a discursive thematic analysis, contrasted Prime Minister Ardern’s use of identity-based rhetoric to mobilise New Zealanders, with Prime Minister Johnson’s use of individualistic appeals to the UK public. Study 2 explored which patterns of social identification predicted protective behaviours (personal hygiene, physical distancing), prosocial actions (helping proximal and distal others), and psychological wellbeing (mental wellbeing, depressive symptoms, anxiety), among 560 UK adults surveyed during lockdown. Our findings suggest how political leaders might beneficially use social identities in communications about extreme events.",Vivian Vignoles et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EC-C96-51C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EC-C96-51C,2020-09-29,2020-12-21T22:28:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
35,Paranoia and Belief Updating During a Crisis,"The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made the world seem unpredictable. During such crises we can experience concerns that others might be against us, culminating perhaps in paranoid conspiracy theories. Here, we investigate paranoia and belief updating in an online sample (N=1,010) in the United States of America (U.S.A). We demonstrate the pandemic increased individuals’ self-rated paranoia and rendered their task-based belief updating more erratic. Local lockdown and reopening policies, as well as culture more broadly, markedly influenced participants’ belief-updating: an early and sustained lockdown rendered people’s belief updating less capricious. Masks are clearly an effective public health measure against COVID-19. However, state-mandated mask wearing increased paranoia and induced more erratic behaviour. Remarkably, this was most evident in those states where adherence to mask wearing rules was poor but where rule following is typically more common. This paranoia may explain the lack of compliance with this simple and effective countermeasure. Computational analyses of participant behaviour suggested that people with higher paranoia expected the task to be more unstable, but at the same time predicted more rewards. In a follow-up study we found people who were more paranoid endorsed conspiracies about mask-wearing and potential vaccines – again, mask attitude and conspiratorial beliefs were associated with erratic task behaviour and changed priors. Future public health responses to the pandemic might leverage these observations, mollifying paranoia and increasing adherence by tempering people’s expectations of other’s behaviour, and the environment more broadly, and reinforcing compliance.",Praveen Suthaharan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46060-374-001,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46060-374-001,2020-09-04,2020-12-21T22:27:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning,False
36,Racial Inequity in Federal Grant Funding,"Circulation of videos showing the death of George Floyd, at the hands of police officers, in May of 2020 prompted renewed national conversations about systemic racism. Biomedical research in the USA, including that supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is not immune to the systemic racism that pervades American society. A groundbreaking analysis of NIH grant success revealed in 2011 that applications submitted by Black or African-American Principal Investigators (PIs) were less likely to be funded, compared with those submitted by white PIs. NIH efforts to respond have included attempts to attribute the effect to mediating variables other than PI race; attempts to fix the “pipeline” by funding more African-American trainees; and attempts to eliminate subconscious, or implicit, bias in peer reviewers. An updated report published in 2019 showed that nothing has changed and that topics of interest to African-Americans are less likely to be funded, even with white PIs. Here, we review the response of the NIH to these issues, which we argue are inadequate, and we issue a call to action for all participants in the tax-payer funded NIH system of research funding. It is unacceptable that NIH grant funding disparities based on the race of the PI continue to persist in the current system. It is unacceptable that health conditions and topics of interest to Black citizens are systematically overlooked for research funding. The NIH must create an actionable plan that permanently eliminates racial disparities in grant award.",Michael Taffe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DC-671-691,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DC-671-691,2020-12-10,2020-12-21T22:26:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Other Neuroscience and Neurobiology; grant funding; nih,False
37,"COVID-19 and Wellbeing: Demographics, Individual Differences, and Leadership Help Explain Pandemic Impact","Across the globe, COVID-19 continues to disrupt everyday lives, with serious consequences for individuals' health and wellbeing. This retrospective, multinational survey study draws upon the Personal Resource Allocation (PRA) framework to explore how various demographic factors, individual differences, and leadership determine the perceived and actual impact of COVID-19 on health (mental, physical) and wellbeing (work, home, general) across five countries: Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Having dependents under 12, working more hours since the onset, and having essential worker status led to better wellbeing outcomes. All three individual differences (adaptivity, resilience, remote work training) were positively related to engagement, with resilience and remote work also relating to better health for these individuals. Lastly, perceptions of COVID impact on mental and physical health had negative consequences for general wellbeing, while effective leadership perceptions predicted work engagement. No differences were found between the five countries. Findings highlight the importance of personal resources in determining the pandemic’s impact on wellbeing.",Matthew J Grawitch et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46113-E62-3DC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46113-E62-3DC,2020-12-10,2020-12-21T22:26:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Leadership; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Work-life Quality; wellbeing; engagement; remote work training; resilience; adaptivity,False
38,Moral decision making in healthcare and medical professions during the COVID-19 pandemic,"With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, healthcare and medical professions face challenging situations. High number of infected patients, scarce resources, and being vulnerable to the infection are among the reasons that may influence clinicians’ decision making and puts them in a moral situation. Furthermore, they may be carriers of coronavirus, resulting their social interactions to involve moral decision making. The aim of this study was to examine the moral decision making in clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and to find its relation to psychological, cognitive, and behavioral correlates. 193 clinicians who worked in hospitals allocated to coronavirus disease patients, participated in our study. We designed an online survey containing 8 dilemmas to test moral decision making in clinicians. Information on clinicians’ behavior, cognition and psychological state during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the degree of respect to social distancing, sources of stress, and dead cases of COVID-19 they confronted with were collected. The relation between these measures and moral decision making was assessed. Based on our results, clinicians’ most important source of stress was the infection of their families. There was a positive correlation between utilitarian responses and clinicians’ stress level, and number of dead cases they confronted with. Moreover, degree of utilitarian behavior was positively correlated to social distancing. Both age and sex contributed to individual differences in respecting social distancing, stress and utilitarian behavior. With increasing stress and encountering more deaths, clinicians tended to decide based on the outcome. Our results have critical implications in implementing policies for healthcare principals.",Hamed Borhany et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-99F-01A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D7-99F-01A,2020-09-01,2020-12-21T22:26:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; front-line workers; moral decision making; healthcare and medical professions; covid-19; utilitarian behavior,False
39,Psychiatry and Covid-19: Acute mental health presentations before and during the pandemic,"Background We aimed to analyse numbers and types of psychiatric presentations to inform planning for future demand on mental health services in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods We analysed electronic data between January and April 2020 for 2,534 patients referred to acute psychiatric services. We used interrupted time series analyses to compare trends in A&E and psychiatric presentations before and after lockdown, and tested for differences in patients’ demographics, symptom severity, and use of the Mental Health Act, before and after lockdown. Results There were 11% fewer psychiatric presentations the first week and 64% fewer A&E presentations the first month after lockdown initiated. A higher proportion of patients were detained under the Mental Health Act (22.2% vs 16.1%) and Mental Capacity Act (2.2 vs 1.1%)(χ2(2)=16.3, p<0.0001) and they experienced a longer duration of symptoms before seeking help from mental health services (χ 2(3)= 18.6, p<0.0001). A higher proportion of patients presented with psychotic symptoms (23.3% v 17.0%) or delirium (7.0 v 3.6%) and fewer had parasuicidal behaviour (43.8% v 52.0, χ2 (7)= 28.7, p<0.0001). A higher proportion were admitted to psychiatric inpatient units (22.2% vs 18.3%) (χ 2(6)= 42.8, p<0.0001) after lockdown Conclusions UK lockdown resulted in fewer psychiatric presentations but those who presented were more likely to have severe symptoms, be detained under the Mental Health Act and admitted to hospital.

40,Supporting Families to Protect Child Health: Parenting Quality and Household Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic-linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent-child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.",Leslie E Roos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A,2020-09-04,2020-12-21T22:23:26+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; psychology; covid; maternal-child health; family; mental health; child development; depression,False
41,"Trajectories of eating behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of 22,374 adults in the UK","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the implementation of stay-at-home and lockdown measures. It is currently unknown if the experience of lockdown leads to long term changes in individual’s eating behaviors. Objective: The objectives of this study were: i) to derive longitudinal trajectories of change in eating during UK lockdown, and ii) to identify risk factors associated with eating behavior trajectories. Design: Data from 22,374 UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social study (a panel study collecting weekly data during the pandemic) were analyzed from 28th March to 29th May 2020. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to derive trajectories of change in eating. These were then associated with prior socio-economic, heath-related and psychological factors using multinomial regression models. Results: Analyses suggested five trajectories, with the majority (64%) showing no change in eating. In contrast, one trajectory was marked by persistently eating more, whereas another by persistently eating less. Overall, participants with greater depressive symptoms were more likely to report any change in eating. Loneliness was linked to persistently eating more (OR= 1.07), whereas being single or divorced, as well as stressful life events, were associated with consistently eating less (OR= 1.69). Overall, higher education status was linked to lower odds of changing eating behavior (OR= 0.54-0.77). Secondary exploratory analyses suggest that participants self-reported to have overweight were most common amongst the consistently overeaters, whereas underweight participants persistently ate less. Conclusion: In this study, we found that one third of the sample report changes in quantities eaten throughout the first UK lockdown period. Findings highlight the importance of adjusting public health programs to support eating behaviors in future lockdowns both in this and potential future pandemics.

42,Psychological and situational effects on social distancing and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: not a question of real risk,"Keeping a large interpersonal space (IPS) is one of the most important measures to counter the COVID-19 pandemic. The IPS is automatically modulated according to primary affiliation and defence needs aimed at protecting our physical and psychological well-being. Through a multicentric online survey (1293 respondents) in six Italian regions during the lockdown (April-May 2020), we investigated the psychological and situational factors that influenced the regulation of IPS and psychological well-being. The results showed that the IPS was modulated according to perceived rather than actual risk of COVID-19 infection. This perception was influenced by institutional communication and citizen satisfaction in local Healthcare Systems. Higher levels of anxiety, stress and feeling of insecurity, exacerbated by situational factors linked to the context of life, led to an increase in IPS at the expense of psychological well-being. Instead, the possibility to go out and seeing other people wearing a face-mask reduced the IPS.

43,Association of coping strategies with mental health trajectories during the first twenty-one weeks of COVID-19 lockdown,"The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is well evidenced. However, there is little research on how individuals’ coping strategies during the pandemic were related to changes in mental health over time. The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study (N=26,505) to explore whether particular coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery from symptoms across 21 weeks. People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress.",Meg Fluharty et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-A63-3CF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-A63-3CF,2020-11-10,2020-12-21T22:16:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; longitudinal; depression; mental health; coping; covid-19; anxiety,False
44,Early Indicators of COVID-19 Infection Prevention Behaviors: Machine Learning Identifies Personal and Country-Level Factors,"The Coronavirus is highly infectious and potentially deadly. In the absence of a cure or a vaccine, the infection prevention behaviors recommended by the World Health Organization constitute the only measure that is presently available to combat the pandemic. The unprecedented impact of this pandemic calls for swift identification of factors most important for predicting infection prevention behavior. In this paper, we used a machine learning approach to assess the relative importance of potential indicators of personal infection prevention behavior in a global psychological survey we conducted between March-May 2020 (N = 56,072 across 28 countries). The survey data were enriched with society-level variables relevant to the pandemic. Results indicated that the two most important indicators of self-reported infection prevention behavior were individual-level injunctive norms—beliefs that people in the community should engage in social distancing and self-isolation, followed by endorsement of restrictive containment measures (e.g., mandatory vaccination). Society-level factors (e.g., national healthcare infrastructure, confirmed infections) also emerged as important indicators. Social attitudes and norms were more important than personal factors considered most important by theories of health behavior. The model accounted for 52% of the variance in infection prevention behavior in a separate test sample—above the performance of psychological models of health behavior. These results suggest that individuals are intuitively aware that this pandemic constitutes a social dilemma situation, where their own infection risk is partly dependent on the behaviors of others. If everybody engaged in infection prevention behavior, the virus could be defeated even without a vaccine.",Caspar J.

45,Social Distancing in America: Understanding Long-term Adherence to Covid-19 Mitigation Recommendations,"A crucial question in the governance of infectious disease outbreaks is how to ensure that people continue to adhere to mitigation measures for the longer duration of the pandemic. The present paper examines this question by means of a nationally representative cross-sectional set of studies conducted in the United States in May, June, and July 2020. It seeks to understand to what extent Americans continued to adhere to social distancing measures in the period after the first lockdown ended during the first wave of COVID-19. Moreover, it seeks to uncover which situational and motivational variables sustained (or undermined) adherence. Our findings reveal a mix of situational and motivational variables that contributed to adherence in the period after the first lockdown: individuals’ knowledge of social distancing measures, their practical capacity to adhere to them, their opportunities for not doing so, and their impulsivity (situational influences), as well as their moral alignment with mitigation measures against the virus, perceptions of its health threat, and perceived norms for adherence in their community (motivational influences). The results also reveal, however, that adherence among Americans declined during this period, as did important situational and motivational processes that sustained this. The findings show that adherence does not just originate in motivations and that situational variables play a central role. Moreover, they show that adherence is dynamic, as the core variables that sustain can change over a short period of time. These insights help to advance understanding of pandemic governance, as well as illuminating the interaction between rules and human conduct and compliance more generally. Moreover, they identify important avenues for policy to promote and sustain adherence to mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and in future outbreaks.",Christopher Reinders Folmer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620F-583-148,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620F-583-148,2020-10-07,2020-12-21T17:08:57+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; public health behaviors; pandemic compliance; trust in science; united states of america; capacity; covid-19; political orientation; emotions; threat perceptions; george floyd; opportunity; trust in media; social distancing; health behaviors; social norms; compliance; obligation to obey the law; black lives matter; procedural justice; deterrence; partisanship; public health; impulsivity; adherence",False
46,Is it riskier to meet 100 people outdoors or 14 people indoors? Comparing public and expert perceptions of COVID-19 risk,"How do people perceive and integrate multiple contextual risk factors for COVID-19 infection? We elicited risk perceptions from a nationally representative sample of the public (N = 800) using three psychologically-distinct tasks. Responses were compared to a sample of medical experts who completed the same tasks. The public underestimated the risk associated with environmental factors (such as whether a gathering takes place indoors or outdoors) and the implications when multiple risk factors are present. Our results are consistent with a heuristic simply to ‘avoid people’ and with a coarse (e.g. ‘safe or unsafe’) classification of social settings. A further task, completed only by the general public sample, generated novel evidence that when the risk of infection competes against a risk in another domain (e.g. a different medical risk), people perceive a lower likelihood of contracting the virus.

47,Locking down behavioural compliance: the role of emotion and emotion regulation in breaches of COVID-19 mitigation measures,"Rapidly emerging research suggests that virus-specific anxiety and worry can motivate compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, people may choose to cognitively reappraise these unpleasant emotional experiences, decreasing their anxiety and worry at the cost of lower engagement in mitigation behaviours. New Zealand university students experiencing a nationwide lockdown (n = 278) completed measures indexing the extent of their current and future COVID-19 worry, current anxiety, COVID-19 reappraisal, knowledge of government-mandated lockdown policies, and compliance with these policies. Despite high knowledge of lockdown policies, 92.5% of participants reported breaching one or more lockdown policies (M = 2.74, SD = 1.86). Counter to predictions, no relationships were found between anxiety, current worry, future worry with COVID-19 specific reappraisal use or lockdown breaches. Participants with essential worker(s) in their lockdown ‘bubble’ reported fewer lockdown breaches, but knowledge of lockdown policies and having individual(s) at high risk of COVID-19 complications in their ‘bubble’ were unrelated to lockdown breaches. Findings highlight the importance of targeting young adults when promoting widespread compliance with public health measures and offer further insights into the role of emotion during pandemic.",Terise Broodryk et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622A-BAF-2B1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622A-BAF-2B1,2020-12-18,2020-12-21T16:23:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; pandemic; lockdown; emotion regulation; public health behaviour; quarantine,False
48,Interest consistency can buffer the effect of COVID-19 fear on psychological distress,"In the context of a recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the present study investigated the buffering effect of grit on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress. The data were collected from 224 Japanese participants (98 females; mean age = 46.56, SD = 13.41) in July 2020. The measures used in this study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Short Grit Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS). The results of mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of consistency of interest, a major component of grit, on psychological distress; we also found non-significant indirect effects of perseverance of effort, another major component of grit, on psychological distress. These results suggest that consistency of interest buffers the psychological distress induced by fear of COVID-19.

49,False-positive Effect in the Radin Double-slit Experiment: HARKing is used by Radin et al. to Misrepresent the Advanced Meta-experimental Protocol used in Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019),"A general commentary by Walleczek and von Stillfried (2020) was recently published in Frontiers in Psychology. The present work provides an account of (i) the detailed research record and (ii) the main arguments behind the commentary for the purpose of full transparency and disclosure. For historical overview, Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019) had previously reported (i) the absence of any true-positive effects and (ii) the presence of one false-positive effect in a commissioned replication study of the Radin double-slit (DS) experiment on observer consciousness. In their subsequent misrepresentations, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) regrettably used the malpractice of undisclosed HARKing, i.e., undisclosed hypothesizing after the results are known. HARKing can increase greatly the risk of false-negative or false-positive conclusions. Specifically, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) deviated in two major ways from the pre-specified protocol for this commissioned study, which (i) was agreed to by Radin before data collection was started (Radin, 2011) and (ii) included data encryption to prevent the use of p-hacking and HARKing. First, Radin et al. (2019) violate the original research design by reporting a so-called “true-positive outcome of a secondary planned hypothesis”. Contrary to the claim by Radin et al. (2019, 2020), that hypothesis was not, however, part of the planned test strategy, but, instead, the associated statistical analysis – a chi-square test – was chosen by Radin sometime after the planned statistical analysis had been completed and the data unblinded. Second, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) violate the funder-approved research design in an additional way by falsely claiming that the newly developed protocol, i.e., the advanced meta-experimental protocol (AMP), implements a non-predictive test strategy when – in fact – the AMP-based test strategy is strictly predictive. Put simply, Radin et al. (2019, 2020) are mistaken that the funder-approved hypotheses posited the random occurrence of effects for the test categories in this replication experiment; instead, a different specific prediction was tested in each of the eight planned test categories, and true-positive effects were predicted to occur for only two (12.5%) of the 16 possible measurement outcomes of the eight planned single-test categories. Therefore, in the predictive single-testing regime, a statistical correction for non-predictive, i.e., random, multiple testing would not be appropriate and would thus violate the AMP-based strategy, which was implemented in the commissioned study based upon the planned outcome predictions as pre-specified in Radin (2011). Neither of these post-hoc changes by Radin et al. (on the basis of HARKing) were disclosed in Radin et al. (2019, 2020) and both these changes violate the funder-approved, original methodology agreed upon in Radin (2011) and pre-specified in the research contract. In summary, the present work reconfirms that – exactly as reported in Walleczek and von Stillfried (2019) – “the false-positive effect, which would be indistinguishable from the predicted true-positive effect, was significant at p = 0.021 (σ = −2.02; N = 1,250 test trials)” and “no statistically significant effects could be identified” in those two groups for which true-positives were predicted to occur. These observations are consistent also with an independent statistical reanalysis of the Radin DS-experiment by Tremblay (2019) and a replication attempt by Guerrer (2019). Tremblay reported significant false-positives in control groups and Guerrer found significant effects with post-hoc analyses only, but null results only when using the planned confirmatory analysis. As a general recommendation, the authors call for the implementation of advanced control-test strategies, including novel approaches from the metascience reform movement, for empirically detecting and preventing uncontrolled false-positive effects in parapsychological research.",Jan Walleczek et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-9EB-7DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46212-9EB-7DD,2020-07-29,2020-12-21T07:31:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; advanced meta-experimental protocol; confirmatory analysis; counterfactual meta-experimentation; radin double-slit experiment; harking; metascience reform movement,False
50,"Healthcare worker intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and reasons for hesitancy: A survey of 16,158 health system employees on the eve of vaccine distribution","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have been recommended to receive first priority for limited COVID-19 vaccines. They have also been identified as potential ambassadors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, helping to ensure that sufficient members of a hesitant public accept COVID-19 vaccines to achieve population immunity. Yet HCWs themselves have shown vaccine hesitancy in other contexts and the few prior surveys of U.S. HCW intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine report acceptance rates of only 28% to 34%. However, it is unknown whether HCW acceptance remains low following mid-November announcements of the efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines and the issuance of two emergency use authorizations (EUA) in December. We report the results of a December 2020 survey (N = 16,158; response rate 61%) administered by a large Pennsylvania health system to determine the intentions of its employees to receive a vaccine when it is offered to them. In a mixed sample of individuals serving in patient-facing and other roles, 55% would decide to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when offered, 16.4% would not, and 28.5% reported being undecided. The distribution of responses varied little across hospital campuses, between those in patient-facing roles and other HCWs, or by area or department of work. The higher rate of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance we observe may reflect the framing and timing of our survey. Among hesitant respondents, an overwhelming majority (90.3%) reported concerns about unknown risks and insufficient data. Other commonly reported concerns included known side effects (57.4%) and wanting to wait until they see how it goes with others (44.4%). We observed a substantial increase in self-reported intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine after an FDA advisory committee voted to recommend an EUA. Among respondents who completed the survey after that point in time, 79% intend to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (n = 1155). Although only suggestive, this trend offers hope that rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance may be higher among HCWs and, perhaps, the general public than more hypothetical survey results have indicated.",Michelle N.

51,Psychological distance towards COVID-19: Geographical and hypothetical distance predict attitudes and mediate knowledge,"Objectives: We applied the concept of psychological distance to understand the perceived affection by COVID-19 and investigated its connection with protective behaviour (RQ1), context-specific antecedents (RQ2), and its possibility to mediate the effect of knowledge on attitudes (RQ3). Design: We conducted a quantitative cross-sectional study (N = 395, Mage = 32.2 years, SDage = 13.9 years, 64.3% female) in Germany in July 2020, a time with a low incidence of people infected with Sars-CoV2. Methods: People completed online questionnaires about socio-psychological constructs addressing COVID-19, further information was included from external sources. Results: Geographical distance only predicted cognitive attitudes towards COVID-19 (β = -0.25, p < 0.001), hypothetical distance (i.e. feeling to be likely affected by COVID-19) predicted participants’ affective, cognitive, and behavioural attitudes (-0.16 < β < -0.28) and the installation of a warning-app (β = -0.18, p < 0.01). Geographical distance to COVID-19 was predicted by living in cities and knowledge. Hypothetical distance was affected by Sars-CoV2 cases in social surrounding, knowledge, and level of education. Hypothetical and geographical distance mediated the effect of knowledge on attitudes. Conclusions: While geographical distance affected peoples’ cognitive evaluation of COVID-19, hypothetical distance predicted the evaluation and the implementation of protective behaviours. Since Sars-CoV2 affects spatial regions differently, there is a need for addressing the likelihood of infecting oneself with COVID-19, which may be an objective for formal and informal educational activities. However, the success of these activities depends on peoples’ geographical and hypothetical distance, given their mediating role between knowledge and attitudes.",Simon Blauza et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-763-AE1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DC-763-AE1,2020-12-16,2020-12-20T07:37:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior,False
52,Investigating the Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on Assessment of Cognition: a Web-based Questionnaire Study,"We investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the modality of cognitive assessments (in-person versus remote assessments). We created a web-based questionnaire with 34 items and collected data from 114 respondents from a range of health care professions and settings. We established the proportion of cognitive assessments which were face-to-face or via video or telephone conferencing, both pre- and post-March 2020. Further, we asked respondents about the assessment tools used and perceived barriers, challenges and facilitators for the remote assessment of cognition. In addition, we asked questions specifically about the use of the Oxford Cognitive Screen. We found that the frequency of assessing cognition was stable compared to pre-pandemic levels. Use of telephone and video conferencing cognitive assessments increased by 10% and 18% respectively. Remote assessment increased accessibility to participants and safety but made observing the subtleties of behaviour during test administration difficult. The respondents called for an increase in the availability of standardised, validated, and normed remote assessments. We conclude that the pandemic has not been detrimental to the frequency of cognitive assessments. In addition, a shift in clinical practice to include remote cognitive assessments is clear and wider availability of validated and standardised remote assessments is necessary.",Sam Sappho Webb et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46027-E50-ED4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46027-E50-ED4,2020-12-18,2020-12-20T07:30:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; cognitive assessment; video conferencing; teleneuropsychology; remote assessment; telephone conferencing; cognition,False
53,Is the Myth of Left-Wing Authoritarianism Itself a Myth?,"Is left-wing authoritarianism (LWA) closer to a myth or a reality? Twelve studies test the empirical existence and theoretical relevance of LWA. Study 1 reveals that both conservative and liberal Americans identify a large number of left-wing authoritarians in their lives. In Study 2, participants explicitly rate items from a recently-developed LWA measure as valid measurements of authoritarianism. Studies 3-11 show that persons who score high on this same LWA scale possess the traits associated with models of authoritarianism (while controlling for political ideology): LWA is positively related to threat sensitivity across multiple areas, including general ecological threats (Study 3), COVID disease threat (Study 4), Belief in a Dangerous World (Study 5), and Trump threat (Study 6). Further, controlling for ideology, high-LWA persons show more support for restrictive political correctness norms (Study 7), rate African-Americans and Jews more negatively (Studies 8-9), and show more domain-specific dogmatism and attitude strength (Study 10). Study 11 reveals that the majority of the effects from Studies 3-10 hold when looking only within liberals, thus revealing these effects are about liberal authoritarianism. Study 12 uses the World Values Survey to provide evidence of Left-Wing Authoritarianism around the globe. Taken in total, this large array of triangulating evidence from 12 studies comprised of over 8,000 participants from the U.S. and over 66,000 participants world-wide strongly suggests that left-wing authoritarianism is much closer to a reality than a myth.",Lucian Gideon Conway Iii et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-516-F0B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-516-F0B,2020-12-18,2020-12-20T07:13:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; left-wing authoritarianism; ideological asymmetry; political psychology; ideology; right-wing authoritarianism,False
54,"Optimism, Mindfulness, and Resilience as Potential Protective Factors for the Mental Health Consequences of Fear of the Coronavirus","The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on mental health. Prior reports have shown that depression, anxiety, and stress have increased throughout the pandemic. Nonetheless, not everyone is affected by these negative consequences and some people may be relatively unaffected. In this online study in a predominantly Dutch and Belgian sample (N = 546), we investigated whether positive personality traits such as optimism, mindfulness, and resilience may protect against the negative mental health consequences (i.e., fear of the coronavirus, depression, stress, and anxiety) of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that fear of COVID-19 was related to higher depression, stress, and anxiety. However, for participants scoring high on mindfulness, optimism, and resilience, this relationship was weakened. In addition to these findings, we present the results of network analyses to explore the network structure between these constructs.

55,Nowhere to go: Parents' descriptions of children's physical activity during a global pandemic,"Objective: The purpose of the study was to understand, from the perspective of parents, how the COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates affected children’s physical activity. Design: Open-ended survey Setting: Online Method: Data were collected from 335 parents living in the United States of America. Parents answered an open-ended prompt to describe their children's physical activity during COVID-19 shelter-in-place mandates. Following data collection, inductive and deductive content analysis examined patterns in the data. Results: Analyses indicated that shelter-in-place mandates restricted children’s opportunities for physical activity. However, if families had access to outdoor spaces or equipment, they could encourage and support more physical activity opportunities than those without. Families in the lower-income bracket had less access to outdoor space and subsequently those children had fewer opportunities to be physically active. Parents supported their children’s physical activity through their involvement and encouragement. Conclusion: These findings underscore the importance of access to outdoor spaces and equipment for increasing children’s physical activity. Findings can be used by educators and policy makers to equitably support families of lower socioeconomic status who reported less access to outdoor spaces.",Deanna Perez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-324-6C1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-324-6C1,2020-12-17,2020-12-18T08:16:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; health; active play; covid-19; children; families,False
56,Changes in work culture and workplace due to COVID19 crisis,"Across the world when the deadly COVID-19 virus started spreading, severe health issues and death rates increased amongst thousands of people in a noticeably short period. The one and the only way to stop the transmission of the virus was to stop economic and social activities in the affected countries for an indefinite time. This research covers three main sections which are growing variations in work practices that have remained essential to stop the spread, including compulsory working from home, psychological and financial impacts that are noticeable in the aftermath of COVID-19, which includes idleness, mental illness, and dependence. Besides, the potential moderating factor of age is also examined.

57,Correlates and Outcomes of Pandemic Fatigue,"In response to the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments and health-authorities have both recommended and mandated various measures aiming to contain the spread of the virus and, in turn, save lives. Despite generally high levels of compliance with and public support for these measures, several countries have witnessed a recent upsurge in the number of people who no longer sufficiently adhere to the restrictions and keep themselves informed about the pandemic. This developing trend has either been named or attributed to Pandemic Fatigue. Notably, though, a scientific conceptualization, including an identification of Pandemic fatigue and theoretical dissociation from its correlates and outcomes, is completely lacking. Using representative survey data from Denmark and Germany (overall N = 5,841), we introduce a psychometrically sound measure of Pandemic Fatigue, show who experiences it, identify related emotions and perceptions, and reveal its effects on health protective behaviors. We find that Pandemic Fatigue consists of two distinct, yet highly correlated dimensions – Information and Behavioral Fatigue – and that younger, healthier, and less educated people are more likely to experience it. Further, we find that Pandemic Fatigue is related to certain emotions and perceptions that could be targeted through different interventions in an attempt to reinvigorate fatigued individuals. Moreover, we find that Pandemic Fatigue is a strong predictor of nonadherence to health protective measures, even beyond other relevant emotions and perceptions. Taken together, the results call for a multifaceted approach towards keeping public compliance high when facing a pandemic.",Lau Lilleholt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-D9F-581,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-D9F-581,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T21:27:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False
58,Mood variability among early adolescents in times of social constraints: A daily diary study during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic and associated governmental regulations have drastically changed the daily social lives of children, adolescents and adults. Changes in the social context may particularly affect children who are in the transition to adolescents (henceforth referred to as early adolescents) as adolescence is a crucial period for peer interactions and development of independence and autonomy. Yet, the impact of the pandemic and associated governmental regulations on early adolescents’ emotional well-being has yet to be clarified. In the current study, we explored daily fluctuations in mood in 54 early adolescents (Mage = 11.07) during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the role of parents and peers on adolescents’ mood variability was investigated. Adolescents rated their mood (i.e., happiness, anger, sadness, anxiety) and peer interactions once a day during four separate weeks across different weeks of containment measures in the Netherlands. Moreover, adolescents reported on their experienced attachment to parents and peers and internalizing problems during baseline and the final measurement, respectively. Results showed relatively stable levels of mood during the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, individual differences in mood variability during the first assessment week were negatively associated with the experienced level of attachment to both parents and peers. Moreover, heightened levels of mood variability did not mediate the link between attachment and internalizing problems. Lastly, the quality of offline contact, but not online contact, was negatively related to adolescents’ mood variability. Overall, this study suggests that mental well-being of early adolescents may not necessarily be affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and that social connectedness to parents or peers may facilitate resilience to distress and daily mood fluctuation in early adolescents.",Susanne Asscheman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-4D6-ED9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-4D6-ED9,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T21:21:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development,False
59,Self-Interest Bias in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Own Self-Serving Behaviors Are Judged More Leniently than Others’ in the US but not China,"In the global crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries attempt to enforce new social norms to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus. A key to the success of these measures is the individual adherence to norms that are collectively beneficial to contain the spread of the pandemic. However, individuals’ self-interest bias (i.e., the prevalent tendency to license own but not others’ self-serving acts or norm violations) can pose a challenge to the success of such measures. The current research examines COVID-19-related self-interest bias from a cross-cultural perspective. Two studies (N = 1,558) sampled from the US and China, and consistently revealed that US participants evaluated their own self-serving acts (exploiting disinfectants or test kits in Study 1; social gathering and sneezing without covering the mouth in Study 2) as more acceptable than identical deeds of others, while such self-interest bias did not emerge among Chinese participants.

60,Considerations for assessment training competencies in health service psychology programs in the age of COVID-19,"Health service psychologists have made a rapid transition to delivering telepsychology services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The provision of remote assessment services, or teleassessment, however, has lagged behind given the limited evidence base. This delay has been uniquely chal-lenging for university training clinics, which are equally responsible for developing trainee assess-ment competencies and providing high quality assessments to clients. Training clinics have been tasked with implementing programmatic adaptation to meet this need with limited guidance. We address this gap by describing the considerations university training clinics must make under phys-ical distancing policies, including protections for the health of trainees and clients, ensuring stand-ardized administration of assessments, providing developmentally appropriate training opportuni-ties, and guaranteeing transparency in the consent and feedback processes. We recommend solu-tions to reconcile these inherent challenges and highlight training opportunities as they relate to the development of profession-wide competencies and ethical principles. These recommendations demonstrate that by integrating flexibility into program curriculums, training clinics can continue to adhere to accreditation standards while developing trainee competencies in assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Elizabeth Casline et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-CBD-50A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-CBD-50A,2020-12-17,2020-12-17T21:05:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; ethics; assessment competency; teleassessment; training,False
61,Risk Preferences and Risk Perception Affect the Acceptance of Digital Contact Tracing,"Digital contact-tracing applications (DCTAs) can control the spread of epidemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic. But people in Western societies fail to accept DCTAs. Understanding the low acceptance is key to policymakers who support DCTAs to avoid harsh nationwide lock-downs. In a preregistered study in a representative Swiss sample (N=757), we compare the role of individual risk perception, risk preferences, social preferences, and social values in the acceptance of and compliance with DCTA. The results show a low acceptance of DCTAs but high compliance with the measures recommended by DCTAs. Risk preferences and perceptions, but not social preferences, influenced accepting DCTAs; a high health risk perception and a low data-security risk perception increased acceptance. Additionally, supporting political measures, technical abilities, and understanding the DCTA functionality had large effects on accepting DCTAs. Therefore, we recommend highlighting personal health risks and clearly explaining DCTAs, focusing on data security, to enhance DCTA acceptance.",Rebecca Albrecht et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-45C-FB1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A1-45C-FB1,2020-12-01,2020-12-17T20:27:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; risk; social values; contact tracing; corona virus; covid,False
62,Is stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity a pathway linking positive and negative emotionality to carotid intima-media thickness?,"Stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity, trait positive emotionality, and negative emotionality are all associated with cardiovascular disease. It is unknown, however, whether cardiovascular reactivity may constitute a pathway by which trait positive or negative emotionality relates to disease risk. Accordingly, this study modeled the cross-sectional relationships between trait positive and negative emotionality, stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity, and severity of a subclinical vascular marker of cardiovascular risk, carotid artery intima-media thickness (CA-IMT). The sample consisted of healthy, midlife adults free from clinical cardiovascular disease (N = 286; ages 30-54; 50% female). Trait positive and negative emotionality were measured by three questionnaires. Heart rate and blood pressure reactivity were assessed across three stressor tasks. CA-IMT was assessed by ultrasonography. Latent factors of positive and negative emotionality, blood pressure reactivity, heart rate reactivity, and CA-IMT were created using structural equation modeling. Greater negative emotionality was marginally associated with more CA-IMT (β = .21; p = .049), but lower blood pressure reactivity (β = -.19; p = .03). However, heightened blood pressure (β = .21; p = .03), but not heart rate reactivity (β = -.05; p = .75), associated with greater CA-IMT. Positive emotionality was uncorrelated with cardiovascular reactivity (blood pressure: β = -.04; p = .61; heart rate: β = .16; p = .11) and CA-IMT (β = .16; p = .07). Although trait negative emotionality associates with a known marker of cardiovascular disease risk, independent of positive emotionality, it is unlikely via a stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactivity pathway.",Caitlin Marie Dupont et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-604-781,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610C-604-781,2020-07-30,2020-12-17T13:29:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; atherosclerosis; negative emotions; stress physiology; positive emotions,False
63,Analysis System for Emotional Behavior in Football (ASEB-F): Matches of FC Red Bull Salzburg without Supporters during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Draft version 2 06-12-2020,"During the COVID-19 pandemic the “Austrian Bundesliga” – as in many other European football leagues – resumed the season around the end of May 2020 without supporters in the stadiums. These so-called “ghost games” represent a unique and unprecedented opportunity to study the effects of the (missing) audience on the behavior and experience of sports professionals. The present study is the first of its kind, aimed at addressing the psychological effects of these “ghost games” on football players, staff, and officials. The newly developed “Analysis System for Emotional Behavior in Football” (ASEB-F) was used to video analyze and compare the behavior of players, staff, and officials in – in sum – 20 games of FC Red Bull Salzburg in the “Championship Groups” of season 2018/19 (“regular games”) and season 2019/20 (“ghost games”). Additionally, the two seasons were compared based on official matchday statistics. Overall, there were 19.5% fewer emotional situations in “ghost games” than in “regular games”. The results further show a relative increase in the number of emotional behaviors “Self-Adaptor” (+0.8%), “Protest” (+4.2%) and “Fair-Play-Behavior” (+3.1%) in “ghost games”, whereas “Words fight” (-5.1%) and “Discussion” (-5.1%) decreased in “ghost games”. In “regular games” referees were actively involved in 39.4% of all documented emotional situations, whereas in “ghost games” referees were actively involved in only 25.2% of all documented emotional situations (-14.2%). Chronological analysis within games – from kick-on to kick-off – further shows substantial differences in the temporal occurrence of emotional behavior between “regular games” and “ghost games”. The study provides unprecedented insights into the effects of missing supporters in the football games during the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional behavior on the pitch. Without the external factor of supporters, players and staff acted more factually and got less carried away with longer lasting and extensive “Words fights” and “Discussion”. The evidence from this study indicates that – from a sport psychological perspective – the absence of supporters has a substantial influence on the experience and behavior of players, staff, and officials alike.",Michael Christian Leitner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-9D2-64E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613A-9D2-64E,2020-08-05,2020-12-17T12:58:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Nonverbal Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; nonverbal behavior; sport psychology; covid-19; human behavior; referees; sports performance; home advantage; soccer; no supporters; no crowd; football; ghost games,False
64,Sport Psychological Effects of Missing Supporters in European Elite Football during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Draft version 2 17-12-2020,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, European top football (soccer) leagues played the final rounds of season 2019/20 without or strongly limited attendance of supporters (i.e., “ghost games”). From a sport psychological perspective this situation poses a unique opportunity to investigate the crowd’s influence on sports professionals’ behavior and performance. A total of 1286 matches - played in the top leagues of Spain, England, Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, Austria and the Czech Republic - were analyzed for results, points, goals, fouls, bookings and reasons for bookings and contrasted between respective matchdays of season 2018/19 (regular attendance) and season 2019/20 (“ghost games”). There are two main findings. First, the overall home advantage effect in the respective elite leagues - identified in the respective matches of the regular 2018/19 season - vanishes almost completely in the “ghost games” of the 2019/20 season. Consequently, home teams lose significantly more matches, whereas away teams win significantly more matches. Second, home teams are booked significantly more often with yellow cards for committing fouls in “ghost games” relative to regular games. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that this effect is independent on whether the home teams are leading, trailing, or drawing in score. We conclude that missing supporters in European elite football leagues dissolve the “home advantage” effect. This missing support of the “home crowd” has a significant psychological effect on the experience, behavior and performance of home teams and/or officials. The effect is evident in the awarding of yellow cards for fouls for home teams, but not for away teams. There are (at least) three possible explanations: (1) Due to missing supporters, players experience an unfamiliar reduction of arousal and drive, (2) players lack the positive support from the home crowd, resulting in increased dysfunctional aggressive behavior and/or (3) without the pressure from the ranks, referees act more objectively in their decision making.",Michael Christian Leitner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46079-0B7-EDC,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46079-0B7-EDC,2020-09-09,2020-12-17T12:57:30+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; sport; yellow cards; performance; ghost games; home advantage; crowd; fans; behavior; psychology; supporters; football; covid-19; soccer",False
65,Underweighting of rare events in social interactions and its implications to the design of voluntary health applications,"Research on small decisions from experience suggests that people often behave as if they underweight rare events and choose the options that are frequently better. In a pandemic, this tendency implies complacency and reckless behavior. Furthermore, behavioral contagion exacerbates this problem. In two pre-registered experiments (Ntotal = 312), we validate these predictions and highlight a potential solution. Groups of participants played a repeated social game in one of two versions. In the basic version, people clearly preferred the dangerous reckless behavior that was better most of the time over the safer responsible behavior. In the augmented version, we gave participants an additional alternative abstracting the use of an application that frequently saves time but can sometimes have high costs. This alternative was stochastically dominated by the option abstracting the responsible choice and was thus normatively “irrelevant” to the decision participants made. Nevertheless, most people chose the new (“irrelevant”) alternative, providing the first clear demonstration of underweighting of rare events in fully described social games. We discuss public policies that can make the responsible use of health applications better most of the time, thus helping them get traction despite being voluntary. In one field demonstration of this idea amid the COVID-19 pandemic, usage rates of a contact tracing application among nursing home employees more than tripled when using the app also started saving them little time on a daily basis, and the high usage rates sustained over at least four weeks.",Ori Plonsky et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-4EE-84F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-4EE-84F,2020-11-18,2020-12-17T12:40:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Intragroup Processes; covid-19; behavioral game theory; decisions from experience,False
66,Refuting Spurious COVID-19 Treatment Claims Reduces Demand and Misinformation Sharing,"The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a surge of health misinformation, which has had serious consequences including direct harm and opportunity costs. We investigated (N = 678) the impact of such misinformation on hypothetical demand (i.e., willingness-to-pay) for an unproven treatment, and propensity to promote (i.e., like or share) misinformation online. This is a novel approach, as previous research has used mainly questionnaire-based measures of reasoning. We also tested two interventions to counteract the misinformation, contrasting a tentative refutation based on materials used by health authorities with an enhanced refutation based on best-practice recommendations. We found prior exposure to misinformation increased misinformation promotion (by 18%). Both tentative and enhanced refutations reduced demand (by 18% and 25%, respectively) as well as misinformation promotion (by 29% and 55%). The fact that enhanced refutations were more effective at curbing promotion of misinformation highlights the need for debunking interventions to follow current best-practice guidelines.",Douglas Macfarlane et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A9-377-6D3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A9-377-6D3,2020-09-30,2020-12-17T07:05:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Reasoning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; disinformation; health fraud; continued influence effect; debunking; online misinformation sharing; covid-19; misinformation,False
67,The Attitudes of Medical Students for Their Roles and Social Accountability in the COVID-19 Pandemic Era,"Introduction In this study, we aimed to explore the attitude of medical students toward their roles and social accountability in this pandemic era. An online survey asked questions covering the topics of 1) the role of medical students in the pandemic era; 2) Medical education in the ‘new normal,’ and 3) the impact of COVID-19 on medical students. Methods The online survey, developed by a team consisting of 3 medical students, 3 psychiatric residents, and 3 psychiatric professors, was distributed to medical students, graduates, and professors in a single South Korean medical school. Anxiety symptom rating scales, including the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic - 6 (SAVE-6) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scale, were also applied to measure participant anxiety level. Results All of the 213 medical students, 180 graduates, and 181 professors that participated in this online survey were at the same medical school. Medical students indicated their willingness to join the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic if requested; however, graduates and professors recommended that medical students continue their medical school curriculum rather than join the response. In the new normal era, medical education was considered to be changed appropriately. Moreover, adequate knowledge of COVID-19 infection and spread must be considered for the continuation of clinical clerkships during the pandemic. Overall, medical students who indicated anxiety about treating possible or confirmed cases rated higher on the SAVE-6 scale. Finally, medical students who reported that COVID-19 had an influence on their studies and daily life rated higher on the general anxiety scale (GAD-7). Conclusion Social accountability is an important issue for medical students in the pandemic era. At the same time, cultivating professionalism is also important for the readiness for the future healthcare responses.",Jihoon Hong et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-5BC-64B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-5BC-64B,2020-08-19,2020-12-17T06:45:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; pandemic; covid-19; medical students; education,False
68,Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress,"Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of monitoring the mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents during this pandemic and targeting perceived stress and isolation in high-risk youth.",Ian Gotlib et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F,2020-06-19,2020-12-16T23:19:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; covid-19; perceived stress; depression; early life stress; adolescence,False
69,Written benefit finding for improving psychological health during the Covid-19 pandemic first wave lockdown,"Objectives. Written benefit finding has been associated with improvements in psychological and physical health in a range of patient groups. In the present study, we aimed to test the efficacy of written benefit finding, delivered online during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, on self-reported anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms. We also sought to investigate the moderating role of perseverative thinking on these effects. Design. A quantitative longitudinal design was employed. Methods. Participants (n = 91, 33 males, Mage = 37.6, SDage = 15.5; 58 females, Mage = 40.0, SDage = 13.7) completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, stress and physical symptoms at baseline, and again two weeks after being randomised to complete three consecutive days of writing about the positive thoughts and feelings they’ve experienced in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic (written benefit finding condition) or to unemotively describe the events of the previous day (control condition). Self-reported state anxiety was measured immediately before and after writing. Perseverative thinking was also measured at baseline. Results. There was a significant reduction in state anxiety in the written benefit finding condition, relative to the control condition. Anxiety and depression decreased between baseline and the two week follow-up, but this did not differ significantly between the two conditions. Perseverative thinking was negatively associated with changes in anxiety, depression and stress, but did not moderate any writing effects. Conclusions. Written benefit finding may be a useful intervention for improving wellbeing, specifically state anxiety, in the general population.",Sarah Hansen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-034-DF4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-034-DF4,2020-12-15,2020-12-16T02:43:04+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress,False
70,COVID-19 and Student Well-being: Stress and Mental Health during Return-to-School,"Students have been multiply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: threats to their own and their family’s health, the closure of schools and pivoting to online learning in March 2020, a long summer of physical distancing, and then the challenge of returning to school in the fall. The present study engaged with over two thousand (N = 2,310; 1288 female; Mage = 14.5) Alberta secondary students in an online survey during their first few weeks of return-to-school in fall 2020. Students completed an online survey that asked about their perceptions of COVID-19, their fall return-to-school experiences (85% returned in-person), their self-reported pandemic-related stress, and their behaviour, affect, and cognitive functioning in the first few weeks of September. Students reported moderate and equal concern for their health, family confinement, and maintaining social contact. Student stress levels were also above critical thresholds for 25 percent of the sample, and females and older adolescents (age 15-18) generally reported higher stress indicators compared to males and younger (age 12-14) adolescents; stress arousal was also positively and significantly correlated with self-reported behavioural concerns. Discussion focuses on how most students were coping well during the return-to-school, while recognizing that some may require more targeted strategies to address stress arousal and heightened negative affect as a result of COVID-19.",Kelly Dean Schwartz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,2020-12-15,2020-12-16T02:42:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology,False
71,The values of survival: Socio-cultural values predict COVID-19-related mortality,"Preexisting conditions affect disease susceptibility. Here, I show that socio-cultural values are population-level risk factors for disease. Using data from the World Values Survey, I show that, between 2 weeks and 6 months after the first COVID-19-related death in a country, COVID-19-related mortality is increased in countries endorsing values related to political participation, but decreased in countries with more trust in institutions and materialistic orientations. After controlling for income, age, urbanicity, smoking, overweight, private health expenditure and lockdown delay, these socio-cultural values were consistent across country-sets, reduced prediction errors by up to 52% and explained up to 68% of inter-country variability. They were relatively specific to COVID-19-related mortality. I could not identify values predicting general health outcomes, and values predicting increased COVID-19-related mortality predicted decreased mortality due to other causes like environmental-related mortality, explaining up to 90% of inter-country variability. Socio-cultural values might be specific predictors of health outcomes.",Ansgar D Endress,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-5A6-CFA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-5A6-CFA,2020-12-03,2020-12-15T17:38:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
72,Parenting in a Pandemic: Parental Stress During the Physical Distancing Intervention Following the onset of the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective: The main aim of the study was to examine levels of parental stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general parental population (N = 2868) during the strict government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further investigated specific predictors of parental distress, including burnout, anger aimed at children, worry, lack of social support, lower perceived self-efficacy, and difficulty to work from home. Method: In this cross-sectional, epidemiological study, we disseminate an online survey that was administered two weeks after the government-initiated physical distancing protocols were established. Data were collected from March 31 to April 7. Results: Female parents compared to male parents and parents living with more than one child per parent or child(ren) with special needs compared to those living with one or fewer children per parent reported higher levels of parental stress. Burnout and social support were further associated with parental stress. Specifically, nearly one-fourth of the parents reported that they have felt burned out or in the proximity of feeling burned out more than half the days during the social distancing interventions. Also, 29% of the parents reported that they were angrier at their child(ren) than usual during the physical distancing period. Parents with a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis had significantly higher parental stress compared to individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms above standardized cutoff levels among the 2868 parents was 25.4% for depression and 24.1% for anxiety, with the highest prevalence score on both symptoms of anxiety (37.6%) and depression (38.5%) for the youngest parents (age group 21–30 years). Furthermore, the parents who were home with their children and predominantly followed distancing protocol by socially distancing from public activity and peers (i.e., at least 10 out of 14 days) had significantly higher symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (27%), compared to parents who did not isolate in the same manner (i.e., depression 13% and anxiety 15%). Conclusions: The present study reveals that home confinement during the restricted lockdown period is related to markedly high levels of parental stress, in addition to symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents. Given the detrimental effects of depression, anxiety, and parental stress on the quality of life, morbidity rates, as well as adverse child outcomes and the potential risk of child abuse and neglect, these results suggest that appropriate action should be taken to impede further development of these symptoms, as well as developing interventions aimed at vulnerable subgroups and other relevant factors associated with increased parental stress.

73,Musical Engagement and Parent-Child Attachment in Families with Young Children During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of families in the United States and across the world, impacting parent mental health and stress, and in turn, the parent-child relationship. Music is a common parent-child activity and has been found to positively impact relationships, but little is known about music’s role in parent-child interactions during a pandemic. The current study utilized an online questionnaire to assess the use of music in the home of young children and their parents in the USA and Canada during Covid-19 and its relationship with parents’ affective attachment with their child. Musical activity was high for both parents and children. Parents reported using music for both emotion regulation and to socially connect with their children. Parent-child musical engagement was associated with parent-child attachment, controlling for relevant parent variables including parent distress, efficacy, education and parent-child engagement in non-musical activities. These results indicate that music may be an effective tool for building and maintaining parent-child relationships during a period of uncertainty and change.",Selena Steinberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-69F-509,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-69F-509,2020-12-14,2020-12-15T05:57:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; parent-child attachment; music; covid-19; parent-child interactions; early childhood,False
74,Cultural influence on COVID-19 cognitions and growth speed: the role of cultural collectivism,"Many challenges faced by humans require large-scale cooperation for communal benefits. We examined what motivates such cooperation in the context of social distancing and mask wearing to reduce the transmission intensity of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We hypothesized that collectivism, a cultural variable characterizing the extent that individuals see themselves in relation to others, contributes to people’s willingness to engage in these behaviors. Consistent with preregistered predictions, across three studies (n=2864), including a U.S. nationally representative sample, people’s collectivist orientation is positively associated with intentions, positive beliefs, norm perceptions, and policy support for the preventive behaviors. In separate analyses at the country level (n=69 countries), more collectivist countries demonstrated lower growth rate in both COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Together, these studies demonstrate the positive role of collectivism at the individual- and country-level in reducing COVID-19 transmission, and highlight the need to consider culture in public health policies and communications.",Rui Pei et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-4BB-402,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-4BB-402,2020-12-15,2020-12-15T05:54:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Cultural Differences,False
75,Daily associations between sleep and physical activity: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"The day-to-day variations of sleep and physical activity are associated with various health outcomes in adults, and previous studies suggested a bidirectional association between these behaviors. The daily associations between sleep and physical activity have been examined in observational or interventional contexts. The primary goal of the current systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize existing evidence about daily associations between sleep and physical activity outcomes at inter- and intra-individual level in adults. A systematic search of records in eight databases from inception to July 2019 identified 33 peer-reviewed empirical publications that examined daily sleep – physical activity association in adults. The qualitative and quantitative analyses of included studies did not support a bidirectional daily association between sleep outcomes and physical activity. Multilevel meta-analyses showed that three sleep parameters were associated with physical activity the following day: sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and wake after sleep onset. However, the associations were small, and varied in terms of direction and level of variability (e.g. inter- or intra-individual). Daytime physical activity was associated with lower total sleep time the following night at an inter-person level with a small effect size. From a clinical perspective, care providers should monitor the effects of better sleep promotion on physical activity behaviours in their patients.

76,Factors associated with Adherence to Social Distancing Protocols and Hygienic Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: To investigate factors associated with adherence to viral mitigation strategies recommended by the WHO during the COVID-19 pandemic, including adherence to social distancing protocols (SDPs) and adherence to hygienic behavior recommendations (HB). Design: This pre-registered epidemiological study of 4158 adults examines the association between situational, cognitive, affective, behavioral, and personality-based factors with adherence to SDPs and HB during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study further investigates the relationship between central information sources and adherence behavior. Main Outcome Measures: Adherence to social distancing protocols (SDPs) and adherence to hygienic behavior recommendations (HB). Results: Individuals aged between 18-30 reported lowest adherence to SDPs and HB. Greater alcohol consumption was associated with decreased adherence to SDP and HB. Increased risk perception, fear of infection, conscientious personality, and altruistic attitude was associated with greater adherence to SDPs and HB. Males, single individuals, employed individuals, and those without children reported lower adherence to SDPs and HB. Extroverted personality and residents of urban areas were associated with lower adherence to SDPs, but not HB. In contrast to earlier stages of the pandemic, voluntary social distancing was associated with greater adherence to SDPs as opposed to rule-enforced (e.g., mandated) social distancing. Among information sources, increased time spent obtaining information from official (i.e., recognized) newspapers had the strongest favorable association with adherence to both SDPs and HB, followed by information obtainment from recognized television channels. Relying on information from friends and family was associated with decreased adherence to SDPs, but was unrelated to adherence to HB. Sensitivity analyses replicated the findings, supporting the stability and robustness of the proposed models. Conclusion: The present study identifies factors associated with favorable and detrimental adherence behavior along with substantial dissemination routes, presenting strategies which may be utility toward fostering adherence to contemporaneously implemented pandemic mitigation protocols.

77,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis is higher among young Swiss men with a lower socioeconomic status: evidence from a cohort study,"Aims The COVID-19 pandemic affected daily life worldwide. In addition to its tangible physical impacts, it may also have affected those who had been especially vulnerable already before the crisis and those who experienced substantial changes to their work situation during it. The present study aimed to investigate whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis varied with regards to young Swiss men’s pre-crisis level of education and socioeconomic status and to changes in their work situation due to it. Methods A cohort of 2345 young Swiss men (mean age = 29) completed survey-based assessments shortly before (April 2019 to February 2020) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (May to June 2020). Outcomes measured were psychological outcomes before and during the COVID-19 crisis (depression, perceived stress and sleep quality), and the fear, isolation and psychological trauma induced by it. We investigated associations between these outcomes and their predictors: pre-crisis socioeconomic status (relative financial status and difficulty paying bills) and level of education, changes in work situation during the crisis (job loss, partial unemployment, working from home, change in workload) and working in contact with potentially infected people, both inside and outside the healthcare sector. Results COVID-19 changed the employment status of about 21% of participants (job loss, partial unemployment or lost money if self-employed). More than 40% worked predominantly from home during the crisis. Participants with a lower socioeconomic status experienced higher psychological impact (depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation) due to the COVID-19 crisis. A higher impact was also felt by participants who lost their job due to the COVID-19 crisis, the partially unemployed, those with an increased workload or those who worked mainly from home. Overall, working in contact with potentially infected people was not associated with psychological impact. Conclusions Even in a country like Switzerland, with relatively high social security benefits and universal healthcare, the COVID-19 crisis had a considerable psychological impact, especially among those with a lower socioeconomic status and those who experienced deteriorations in their work situation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Supporting these populations during the crisis may help to prevent an amplification of inequalities in mental health and social status.

78,Predictors and patterns of gambling behaviour across the COVID-19 lockdown: findings from a UK cohort study,"The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy is well documented, with widespread furloughs, job loss, and financial insecurity. Concerns have been raised about increases in maladaptive coping behaviours such as gambling, to offset financial losses. Similarly, as individuals spend increased time at home, new populations may initiate or increase the frequency of gambling behaviours. The current study used a large longitudinal study of UK adults (N = 32,559) to examine a range of sociodemographic, stress, and health predictors of (i) gambling during strict lockdown (March to the first week of June 2020), (ii) gambling more frequently during strict lockdown compared to before lockdown, and (iii) continued increased rates of gambling during the relaxing of lockdown restrictions (end of July/early August 2020) compared to earlier in the lockdown (late May/early June 2020). Results from a logistic regression indicated that males, older ages, the employed, those with progressively lower levels of education, who lived in overcrowded accommodation, were highly bored, frequently drank alcohol, smoked or were ex-smokers, and had high risk-taking tendencies were more likely to gamble during strict lockdown. Individuals who were more likely to have increased their frequency of gambling during strict lockdown compared to before the lockdown were highly bored, employed, frequently drank alcohol, and had depression and anxiety, whilst men and current smokers were less likely. As lockdown restrictions eased, individuals of ethnic minority backgrounds, who were current smokers, and with lower education attainment were more likely to continue gambling at heightened rates. This suggests which risk groups should be targeted and provided with more effective coping strategies.",Meg Fluharty et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EC-E56-213,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EC-E56-213,2020-12-10,2020-12-14T17:33:19+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; risk behaviours; lockdown; covid-19; gambling; coping",False
79,Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling). Supporting this idea, two studies using data from the U.K. (cross-sectional) and the U.S. (longitudinal) show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors in the past as well as in the future.",Hui Bai,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22,2020-07-02,2020-12-14T16:10:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
80,Subjective Attribution of Infectious Disease Outbreaks to Climate Change is Associated with Mitigation Behavioural Intentions and COVID-19 Recovery Policy Support,"Scholars argue that personal experience with climate change related impacts has the potential to increase public engagement. Yet, previous studies, which have almost exclusively focussed on experience with extreme weather events, provide mixed results. Based on experiential learning and attribution theory, this article argues that unless individuals’ attribute an event as related to or caused by climate change, their responses may be misdirected. Results based on survey data from a nationally representative sample of the New Zealand public indicates that subjective attribution of infectious disease outbreaks to climate change and to the human impact on the environment is positively associated with mitigation behavioural intentions and policy support. In addition, political affiliation moderates the relationship between subjective attribution and mitigation policy support, indicating a higher potential for right-leaning compared to moderates or left-leaning respondents to learn about climate change through health-related climate change impacts. Helping people understand the role of human impact on the environment and climate change in infectious disease outbreaks is likely to increase public engagement.",Jagadish Thaker,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610F-450-C9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4610F-450-C9D,2020-12-14,2020-12-14T13:48:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; covid-19; political affiliation; behavioural intentions; policy support; climate change; subjective attribution; infectious diseases,False
81,Pre-pandemic Autonomic Nervous System Activity Predicts Well-being during COVID-19 in Israel,"Despite the unfolding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological well-being, there is a lack of prospective studies that target physiological markers of distress. There is a need to examine physiological predictors from the pre-pandemic period to identify and treat individuals at-risk. Our aim was to use pre-pandemic markers of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation, to predict individuals' psychological well-being during the crisis. We also assessed the role of emotion regulation as a mediator of the association between pre-pandemic physiological measures and COVID-related well-being. In May-June 2020, 185 Israeli adults completed online questionnaires assessing their emotional regulation of negative affect since COVID-19 began, and their current well-being. These individuals had participated in lab studies 1.5-3 years prior to this assessment, where their physiological measures were taken, including Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) and Skin Conductance Level (SCL). RSA was positively related to emotion regulation during COVID-19. Emotion regulation, in its turn, positively predicted well-being during the crisis. The mediation was significant and moderated by SCL (index=-0.09, 95%CI [-0.02, -0.0001]), such that it was strongest for individuals with low SCL. We point to pre-pandemic physiological mechanisms underlying individuals' mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have theoretical, diagnostic, and clinical implications that may refine our understanding of the physiological basis of resilience to the current pandemic, and thus may be implemented to identify and assist individuals in these times.",Ilanit Gordon et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E3-5FF-F57,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E3-5FF-F57,2020-12-14,2020-12-14T13:39:04+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; scl; autonomic nervous system; covid-19; rsa",False
82,Antecedents and consequences of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs: a rapid review of the evidence,"COVID-19 conspiracy theories emerged almost immediately after the beginning of the pandemic, and the number of believers does not appear to decline. Conspiracy beliefs can have severe consequences, such as reduced guideline adherence and vaccination intentions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand them. In this rapid review we summarize research from more than 43 publications covering research in 25 countries worldwide. We evaluate the contribution of individual difference variables, biases and attitudes, and social factors to the beliefs, and discuss the consequences of the beliefs on safeguarding, self-centred, and misguided behaviours, vaccination intentions, and other, detrimental behaviours. We suggest that belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories may be boosted by low levels of trust in a context of threat and low levels of comprehensive, accessible information in a context of unknowns. We conclude that interventions are urgently needed to (re-)establish trust and provide accessible information about COVID-19.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-24D-145,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616B-24D-145,2020-11-14,2020-12-14T12:39:14+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Reasoning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression; personality; discrimination; violence; social media; protective behaviours; covid-19; threat; mental health; psychology; group identities; uncertainty; social sciences; trust; information; hoarding; review; trust in science; trust in government; coronavirus; pseudoscientific practices; pandemic; belief; vaccination intention; thinking style; conspiracy belief; infodemic",False
83,"Emotions, reasoning, and mental health as predictors of behavior during three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has required people worldwide to adjust their behavior for several months in response to a crisis of rare proportions. Little is known about the specific factors that affected the progression of the public’s reactions during the pandemic. Individual factors associated with pandemic-related behavior in general, and compliance with public health measures in particular, are not firmly established. We undertook a survey of behavior, emotions, reasoning style, and mental health in the province of Quebec at the beginning, the peak, and the aftermath of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recruited 530 responders from a convenience sample; 154 responders participated in all three surveys. Emotions were most intense at the beginning of the first wave of the pandemic, not at its peak. Responders’ compliance with three public health measures decreased between the peak and the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic; however, mask wearing also became more common. Pandemic-related behavior in general, and compliance with public health measures specifically, were predicted by avoidance-related emotions evoked by the pandemic. Approach-related emotions linked to the societal response contributed specifically to the prediction of compliance with public health measures. In contrast, reasoning style and mental health did not as consistently predict behavior during the pandemic.

84,Mask exposure during COVID-19 changes emotional face processing,"Faces are one of the key ways that we obtain social information about others. They allow people to identify individuals, understand conversational cues, and make judgements about other’s mental states. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, widespread mask-wearing practices were implemented, causing a shift in the way Americans typically interact. This introduction of masks into social exchanges posed a potential challenge – how would people make these important inferences about others when a large source of information was no longer available? We conducted two studies that investigated the impact of mask exposure on emotion perception. In particular, we measured how participants used facial landmarks (visual cues) and the expressed valence and arousal (affective cues), to make similarity judgements about pairs of emotion faces. Study 1 found that participants with higher levels of mask exposure used cues from the eyes to a greater extent when judging emotion similarity than participants with less mask exposure. Study 2 measured participants’ emotion perception in both April and September 2020 – before and after widespread mask adoption – in the same group of participants to examine changes in the use of facial cues over time. Results revealed an overall increase in the use of visual cues from April to September. Further, as mask exposure increased, people with the most social interaction showed the largest increase in the use of visual facial cues. These results provide evidence that a shift has occurred in how people process faces such that the more people are interacting with others that are wearing masks, the more they have learned to focus on visual cues from the eye area of the face.",Elyssa M Barrick et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-F4F-638,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-F4F-638,2020-12-11,2020-12-13T07:14:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Perception; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; face processing; emotion; perception; covid,False
85,Parental Social Isolation and Child Maltreatment Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. Objective: This study examines the association of parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting: Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Methods: Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Results: Parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after statistically controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents’ perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in “lockdown.” Conclusions: Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.",Shawna J.

86,Longitudinal Analysis of Short-term Changes in Relationship Conflict During COVID-19: A Risk and Resilience Perspective,"This study uses a risk and resilience framework to examine short-term self-reported changes in relationship conflict early in the COVID-19 pandemic (March and April 2020). Longitudinal data from U.S. adults in a romantic relationship (N = 291) were collected via three waves of an online survey. Participants self-reported anxiety, depression, increased alcohol use, and dyadic coping since the pandemic. Relationship conflict variables included whether the participant reported that they and their partner “had disagreements related to the Coronavirus,” “had more disagreements than usual,” “had more verbal fights than usual,” and “had more physical fights than usual” in the past 2 weeks. Analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics as well as days spent in lockdown and employment change due to COVID-19. Results indicated that couples’ disagreement and verbal fighting scores increased from Time 1 to Time 2, but disagreements related to COVID-19 and physical fighting did not. Couples with higher levels of dyadic coping reported fewer fights and disagreements on average. However, dyadic coping did not buffer participants from increases in relationship conflict. Increased alcohol use since the pandemic was positively associated with disagreements related to COVID-19, disagreement scores, and verbal fighting scores. More days spent in lockdown was associated with increases in disagreements related to COVID-19. The conditions created by COVID-19 may contribute to worsening relationship conflict, even among couples who start with high levels of dyadic coping. Depression and alcohol use may contribute to poorer relationship quality during the pandemic. There is need for enhanced intervention and mental health supports to mitigate the potential effects of the pandemic on couples’ relationship functioning.",Shawna J.

87,Of Pathogens and Party Lines: Social Conservatism Positively Associates with COVID-19 Precautions among U.S. Democrats but not Republicans,"Consistent with a threat-bias model of ideological differences, social liberals have been shown to be less pathogen-avoidant than tradition-valuing social conservatives. However, particularly when pathogen threat occurs at a societal level, additional factors may influence individual responses. In the current pandemic, the more socially conservative U.S. political party has consistently downplayed the dangers of COVID-19. This creates a natural experiment, allowing examination of the contributions of multiple factors to disease avoidance. We investigated the relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautionary behavior in light of the partisan landscape, exploring whether consumption of, and attitudes toward, different sources of information, as well as differential evaluation of various threats caused by the pandemic—such as direct health costs versus indirect harms to the economy and individual liberties—shape political differences in responses to the pandemic in ways that mask the contributions of social conservatism. In two studies, socially conservative attitudes correlate with self-reported COVID-19 prophylactic behaviors, but only among Democrats. Reflecting larger societal divisions, among Republicans and Independents, the positive relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautions is jointly suppressed by lower trust in scientists, lower trust in liberal and moderate sources, lesser consumption of liberal news media, and greater economic conservatism.",Theodore Samore et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46112-9E1-F5C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46112-9E1-F5C,2020-08-08,2020-12-11T20:12:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; political differences; pathogen avoidance; covid-19; social conservatism; traditionalism,False
88,Perceived stress as mediator for longitudinal effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on wellbeing of parents and children,"Dealing with COVID-19 lockdown may have negative effects on children, but at the same time might facilitate parent-child bonding. Perceived stress may influence the direction of these effects. Using a longitudinal twin design, we investigated how perceived stress influenced lockdown induced changes in wellbeing of parents and children. A total of 106 parents and 151 children (10-13-year-old) filled in questionnaires during lockdown and data were combined with data of previous years. We report a significant increase in parental negative feelings (anxiety, depression, hostility and interpersonal sensitivity). Longitudinal child measures showed a gradual decrease in internalizing and externalizing behavior, which seemed decelerated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in parental negative feelings and children’s externalizing behavior were mediated by perceived stress: higher scores prior to the lockdown were related to more stress during the lockdown, which in turn was associated with an increase in parental negative feelings and children’s’ externalizing behavior. Perceived stress in parents and children was associated with negative coping strategies. Additionally, children’s stress levels were influenced by prior and current parental overreactivity. These results suggest that children in families with negative coping strategies and (a history of) parental overreactivity might be at risk for negative consequences of the lockdown.",Michelle Achterberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-79F-745,2020-09-28,2020-12-10T09:39:10+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Gene-environment Interaction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; externalizing behavior; twin study; psychological symptoms; internalizing behavior; risk factors; lockdown; parental reactivity; perceived stress; development; wellbeing; covid-19; resilience,False
89,How did the mental health of children and adolescents change during early lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK?,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruption to the lives of children and young people. Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors, is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the UK in response to the pandemic. Methods UK-based parents and carers (n = 2,673) of school-aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16 years completed an online survey about their child’s mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. Results The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among pre-adolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders, exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points. Conclusions The findings highlight important areas of concern in terms of the potential impact of lockdown on children and young people’s adjustment.

90,Disease and Disapproval: COVID-19 Concern is Related to Greater Moral Condemnation,"Prior research has indicated that disgust, a manifestation of the behavioral immune system, is associated with harsher moral condemnation. However, the link between physical disgust—an evolved signal of risks to one’s health—and morality has been contentious. We investigated the role of a specific health concern, namely the spread of the coronavirus, and associated COVID-19 disease, on moral condemnation. We hypothesized that individuals who report greater subjective worry about COVID-19 would be more sensitive to moral transgressions. Across 3 studies (N = 913), conducted March-May 2020 as the pandemic started to unfold in the United States, we found that individuals who were worried about contracting the infectious disease made harsher moral judgments than those who were not worried. This effect was not restricted to transgressions involving purity, but extended to transgressions involving harm, fairness, authority, and loyalty, and remained when controlling for political orientation. We furthermore observed suggestive evidence that even relatively unconcerned individuals became more judgmental as the epidemic wore on. These findings add to the growing literature that concrete threats to health can play a role in abstract moral considerations, supporting the notion that judgments of wrongdoing are not based on rational thought alone.",Robert K.

91,Effects of Covid-19 lockdown on parental functioning in vulnerable families,"The Covid-19 pandemic has caused major changes to family life followed by a call for knowledge about how these changes have affected parental functioning, particularly in vulnerable families (Prime, Wade & Brooks, 2020). This study uses a natural experiment design to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 lockdown on parental mental health, parenting stress and three dimensions of destructive interparental conflict in a heterogeneous sample characterized by pre-existing relationship problems. Results from mixed model regression analyses showed that despite significantly higher levels of parenting stress in the lockdown group (n = 744 families) compared with the control group (n = 427 families), lockdown did not adversely affect parental mental health or levels of destructive conflicts behaviors. In fact, levels of verbal aggression and child involvement in conflict decreased during lockdown among parents living apart. Pre-existing destructive conflict levels, financial problems and age of youngest child did not moderate any of the associations. Thus, findings indicated that pre-existing family vulnerability did not predispose for reduced parental functioning during lockdown, beyond increased parenting stress. Resilient processes and an increased sense of purpose may be potential mechanisms. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings due to the welfare context of the sample and as long-term lockdown effects were not investigated. Importantly, children in vulnerable families may have been negatively impacted by increased family time, despite relatively stable parental functioning during lockdown.",Maren Sand Helland et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-EFC-79A,2020-12-07,2020-12-07T18:12:42+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Experimental Design and Sample Surveys; covid-19; vulnerable families; natural experiment design; parental functioning",False
92,Adverse and Benevolent Childhood Experiences Predict Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer adult mental health, and benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) are associated with better adult mental health. Objective. To test whether ACEs and BCEs predict adult mental health beyond current stress and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting. We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (N = 502) at an urban private university in the western United States. Methods. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Results. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, β = 0.45, p = .002. Higher levels of BCEs were associated with lower depressive symptoms, β = -0.39, p = .03, lower perceived stress, β = -0.26, p = .002, and less loneliness, β = -0.12, p = .04. These associations held while controlling for current stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions. Childhood experiences are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. BCEs should be considered an important promotive factor, independent of ACEs, for psychological well-being during a global public health crisis.

93,Stress as a meaningful variable in models of covid-19 spreading,"Covid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus – 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in Wuhan China in December 2019. Because of Covid-19 worldwide spreading in 2020, urgent hygiene and lockdown measures have been implemented with fundamental consequences on the lives of people in all sectors of society. Besides visible socio-economic and documented health effects, the impact of Covid-19 on people’s mental health including stress-related effects on disease spreading remains yet to be addressed.

94,Memories of School Recess Predict Physical Activity Enjoyment and Social-Emotional Well-being in Adults,"School recess can provide social, emotional, and physical benefits for children. Yet, not all children experience recess the same, as inequity in access to recess and variability in the quality of recess exist. Researchers have yet to understand the long-term implications of recess experiences on adult well-being and physical activity behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore the inter-relationships between memories of recess, physical activity, and social-emotional well-being. A total of 514 adults between the ages of 19 and 79 (M = 45.56; SD = 15.62) were surveyed via Prolific, a web-based research platform. Participants were asked about their memories of recess enjoyment and recess exclusion, physical activity levels, physical activity enjoyment, social isolation, social role satisfaction, and sense of meaning and purpose. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that memories of recess enjoyment was associated with meaning and purpose (β = .140, p < .05) and PA enjoyment (β = .209, p < .05). Furthermore, recess exclusion predicted current social isolation (β = .300, p< .05) and was negatively associated with recess enjoyment (β = -.445, p< .05). Findings highlight the importance of childhood recess experiences and its impact on subsequent physical activity behaviors, social isolation, and meaning and purpose later in life.

95,Psychological determinants of emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Fear and anxiety about COVID-19 has swept across the globe. Understanding the factors that contribute to increasing emotional distress regarding the pandemic is paramount—especially as experts warn about rising cases. Despite large amounts of data, it remains unclear which variables are essential for predicting who will be most affected by the distress of future waves. We collected cross-sectional data on a multitude of socio-psychological variables from a sample of 948 United States participants during the early stages of the pandemic. Using a cross-validated hybrid stepwise procedure, we developed a descriptive model of COVID-19 emotional distress. Results reveal that trait anxiety, gender, and social (but not government) media consumption were the strongest predictors of increasing emotional distress. In contrast, commonly associated variables, such as age and political ideology, exhibited much less unique explanatory power. Together, these results can help public health officials identify which populations will be especially vulnerable to experiencing COVID-19 related emotional distress.",Joseph Heffner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607F-1EB-796,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607F-1EB-796,2020-11-02,2020-12-04T17:15:35+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; emotion distress; gender; media; anxiety; covid-19",False
96,The values of survival: Socio-cultural values predict COVID-19-related mortality,"Preexisting conditions affect disease susceptibility. Here, I show that socio-cultural values are population-level risk factors for disease. Using data from the World Values Survey, I show that, between 2 weeks and 6 months after the first COVID-19-related death in a country, COVID-19-related mortality is increased in countries endorsing values related to political participation, but decreased in countries with more trust in institutions and materialistic orientations. After controlling for income, age, urbanicity, smoking, overweight, private health expenditure and lockdown delay, these socio-cultural values were consistent across country-sets, reduced prediction errors by up to 52% and explained up to 68% of inter-country variability. They were relatively specific to COVID-19-related mortality. I could not identify values predicting general health outcomes, and values predicting increased COVID-19-related mortality predicted decreased mortality due to other causes like environmental-related mortality, explaining up to 90% of inter-country variability. Socio-cultural values might be specific predictors of health outcomes.",Ansgar D Endress,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-181-71B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-181-71B,2020-12-03,2020-12-04T03:30:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology|Cross-cultural Psychology,False
97,From ‘It has stopped our lives’ to ‘Spending more time together has strengthened bonds': The varied experiences of Australian families during COVID-19,"The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8th and April 28th, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including: 'Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion'; 'Families are missing the things that keep them healthy'; 'Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy'; 'The unprecedented demands of parenthood'; 'The unequal burden of COVID-19'; and 'Holding on to positivity'. Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude and tolerance.",Subhadra Evans et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5,2020-08-17,2020-12-03T22:51:29+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; social restrictions; qualitative; covid-19; australia; family relationships",False
98,"Behavioural pre-testing of COVID Tracker, Ireland’s contact-tracing app","Contact-tracing mobile phone apps have the potential to play a role in controlling the spread of COVID-19, but their success hinges on widespread uptake by the public. We report a study that behaviourally pre-tested COVID Tracker, Ireland's contact-tracing app, prior to its launch with a large sample of smartphone users. The study was funded by the Department of Health and run in cooperation with the app's developers, NearForm. Participants were randomised to receive different versions of a trial app. They responded to an online survey while downloading and using the app on their phones in real time. The experimental manipulations focused on three broad areas: (i) the level of privacy assurance provided in the app, (ii) the goal-framing of the purpose of the app and (iii) the structuring of the exposure notification received by users if they are recorded as a close contact. Almost one in five participants mentioned privacy concerns in relation to their likelihood of downloading the app. Including additional assurances regarding the privacy of users' data in the app successfully lowered participants' privacy concerns and boosted engagement. This finding fed into the final version of the app released in July 2020. We also found minor beneficial effects of restructuring the exposure notification, but did not find any significant differences between two different types of goal-framing, other than a subtle effect on how the exposure notification is interpreted. Overall, our results demonstrate the value of pre-testing contact-tracing apps from a behavioural perspective to boost uptake, trust and participation.",Hannah Julienne et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-ED0-3D1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615B-ED0-3D1,2020-12-03,2020-12-03T19:24:04+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; contact tracing app; privacy concern; covid-19",False
99,"Dissociation between the Language Network and the Multiple Demand (MD) Network, and Their Functional Roles in Language","Language operations rely on multiple mental activities that are supported by the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Moreover, these cortices are not organized into individual isolated previous but rather consist of multiple large-scale networks: sets of brain regions that share structural and functional properties. Literature generally agrees with two well documented systems in the human brain, which are the language network, and the multiple demand (MD) network. Studies have reported both the participation of language network (e.g., Fedorenko et al., 2010, Vagharchakian et al., 2012; Fedorenko et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2017; Deniz et al., 2019) and MD network in language (e.g., Kuperberg et al., 2003; Rodd et al., 2005, Novais-Santos et al., 2007; January et al., 2009; Peelle et al., 2010; Nieuwland et al., 2012; McMillan et al., 2013), but their possible role in language is debated. In this paper, we review how the language-specific and domain-general MD systems support different aspects of cognition and how they can be dissociated from one another. We argue that core language operations are supported by the language network rather than the MD network, and the MD network does not contribute directly to language recovery after stroke, but plays a role in the recovery of other cognitive functions that are engaged in the same language task.",Weixi Kang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-5EB-26E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46252-5EB-26E,2020-12-03,2020-12-03T19:16:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Cognitive Neuroscience; multiple demand network; language production; language network; executive control; language processing; aphasia recovery,False
100,"Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Impacts in Michigan, USA","Racial disparities have been observed in the impacts of COVID-19 in the United States. In this paper, we used a representative sample of adults in Michigan to examine differences in COVID-19 impacts on Blacks and Whites in four domains: direct, perceived, political, and behavioral. We found that in the initial wave of the outbreak in May 2020, Blacks experienced more severe direct impacts: they were more likely to be diagnosed or know someone who was diagnosed, and more likely to lose their job compared to Whites. Additionally, Blacks differed significantly from Whites in their assessment of COVID-19's threat to public health and the economy, the adequacy of government responses to COVID-19, and the appropriateness of behavioral changes to mitigate COVID-19's spread. Although in many cases these views of COVID-19 were also associated with political ideology, this association was significantly stronger for Whites than Blacks. Continued investigation of racial disparities in COVID-19's impact is necessary, however these preliminary findings of a race-by-ideology interaction are important because they suggest some racial disparities are restricted to conservatives, while more liberal Whites and Blacks exhibit few differences.",Kaston D Anderson-Carpenter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-BA1-ADF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-BA1-ADF,2020-09-19,2020-12-02T17:04:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; ideology; race; covid-19; racial disparity; covid,False

In a German (N=546) and a US (N=199) sample, we examined how different degrees of social distancing impact outcomes related to social exclusion, measuring self-related needs: self-esteem, belonging, control, and meaning. Across both samples social distancing was associated with decreased need fulfillment. German participants reported higher need fulfillment compared to American participants. In comparison to previous studies, self-related needs associated with social distancing were less impacted than under experimental manipulations of social exclusion, however more so than under the baseline condition of inclusion. Working while social distancing was associated with greater need fulfillment, as was identifying as male. Women reported lower need fulfillment in both samples and this difference was mediated by need to belong.

102,Having a Prevention Regulatory Focus Longitudinally Predicts Distress and Health-Protective Behaviors During the COVID-9 Pandemic,"Background: Past research has shown that regulatory focus shapes people’s health and well-being, with those who are focused on prevention (vs. promotion) being more motivated by safety and being less inclined to take risks. Purpose: In the current study, we tested if having a prevention (vs. promotion) focus before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak predicted perceptions and health outcomes and threat over the course of the pandemic. Methods: Participants (N = 161, 51.6% women; Mage = 34.04, SD = 7.77) took part in a longitudinal study. Measures were assessed before the pandemic was declared (in November 2019, T1) and after a global pandemic was declared (on June 2020, T2). Results: Results suggest that people who were more focused on prevention prior to the onset of the pandemic (at T1) perceived greater risk of contracting COVID-19, were more worried about being infected, and engaged in more preventative behaviors during the pandemic (at T2). Additionally, they also reported less anxiety and felt healthier (at T2). Conclusions: People focused on prevention (i.e., motivated by security) are more aware of health threats and more likely to engage in health-protective behaviors. Acting in accordance to their motives seems to help these people to experience better health and reduces anxiety about health even during a pandemic.",David L.

103,Willingness to Use an Approved COVID-19 Vaccine: Cross-National Evidence on Levels and Individual-Level Predictors,"The management of the COVID-19 pandemic critically hinges on the approval of safe and effective vaccines but, equally importantly, on high willingness among lay people to use vaccines when approved. To facilitate vaccination willingness via effective health communication, it is key to understand both levels of skepticism towards an approved COVID-19 vaccine and the demographic, psychological and political sources of this skepticism. To this end, we examine the levels and predictors of willingness to use an approved COVID-19 vaccine in large, representative surveys from eight Western democracies that differ both politically and in terms of the severity of the pandemic: Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Sweden, Italy, United Kingdom, and United States (total N = 9,889). The data reveal large variation in vaccination willingness, both across and within countries ranging from 79 % in Denmark to 38 % in Hungary. Thus, most national levels fall below current best estimates for the required threshold for reaching herd immunity. Across national and demographic groups, the analyses demonstrate that a lack of vaccination willingness is associated with low levels of trust in authorities, conspiracy-related beliefs and a lack of concern about COVID-19. These factors also account for cross-national levels in vaccine willingness.",Marie Fly Lindholt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-AAA-140,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606B-AAA-140,2020-11-27,2020-12-02T09:17:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
104,Joint Modeling of Individual Differences Across Predictions Mitigates the 'Paradox' of Converging Evidence: Comment on Davis-Stober and Regenwetter (2019),"Davis-Stober and Regenwetter (2019; D&R) showed that even if all predictions of a theory hold in separate studies, not even a single individual may be described by all predictions jointly. To illustrate this 'paradox' of converging evidence, D&R derived upper and lower bounds on the proportion of individuals for whom all predictions of a theory hold. These bounds reflect extreme positive and negative stochastic dependence of individual differences across predictions. However, psychological theories often make more specific and plausible assumptions, such as that true individual differences are independent or show a certain degree of consistency (e.g., due to a common underlying trait). Based on this psychometric perspective, I extend D&R's conceptual framework by developing a multivariate normal model of individual effects. Assuming perfect consistency (i.e., a correlation of one) of individual effects across predictions, the proportion of individuals described by all predictions of a theory is identical to D&R's upper bound. The proportion drops substantially when assuming independence of individual effects. However, irrespective of the assumed correlation, the multivariate normal model implies a lower bound that is strictly above D&R's lower bound if a theory makes at least three predictions. The multivariate model thus mitigates the 'paradox' of converging evidence even though it does not resolve it. Overall, scholars can improve the scope of their theories by assuming that individual effects are highly correlated across predictions.",Daniel W.

Everyday kindness enhances well-being and prosocial behavior in the time of COVID-19.,"Acts of everyday kindness are voluntary, low-cost actions intended to express a friendly attitude toward a specific person or persons. In two pre-registered studies we examined whether practicing everyday kindness can help people maintain well-being and prosocial orientation in times of pandemic. In correlational Study 1 (N = 497), performing everyday kindness was positively linked to well-being, social connectedness, and a willingness to engage in more costly prosocial behavior. In an experimental Study 2 (N = 482), practicing acts of everyday kindness increased well-being and actual prosocial behavior, although it did not affect feelings of social connectedness.

106,"Grace Under Pressure: Resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in frontline workers in the UK and Ireland during the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic","The coronavirus pandemic has necessitated extraordinary human resilience in order to preserve and prolong life and social order. Risks to health and even life are being confronted by workers in health and social care, as well as those in roles previously never defined as “frontline”, such as individuals working in community supply chain sectors. The strategy adopted by the UK government in facing the challenges of the pandemic was markedly different from other countries. The present study set out to examine what variables were associated with resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in all sectors of frontline workers, and whether or not these differed between the UK and Republic of Ireland (RoI). Individuals were eligible if they were a frontline worker (in health and social care, community supply chain, or other emergency services) in the UK or RoI during the pandemic. Part of a larger, longitudinal study, the participants completed an online survey to assess various aspects of their daily and working lives, along with their attitudes towards their government’s handling of the crisis, and measurement of psychological variables associated with heroism (altruism, meaning in life, and resilient coping). A total of 1305 participants (N=869, 66.6% from the UK) provided sufficient data for analysis. UK-based workers reported lower wellbeing than the RoI-based participants. In multivariate models, both psychological and pandemic-related variables were associated with levels of resilience, burnout, and wellbeing in these workers, but which pandemic-related variables were associated with outcomes differed depending on the country. The judgment of lower timeliness in their government’s response to the pandemic appeared to be a key driver of each outcome for the UK-based frontline workers. These findings provide initial evidence that the different strategies adopted by each country may be associated with the overall wellbeing of frontline workers, with higher detriment observed in the UK. The judgment of the relatively slow response of the UK government to instigate their pandemic measures appears to be associated with lower resilience, higher burnout, and lower wellbeing in frontline workers in the UK.",Rachel Clair Sumner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46178-993-F57,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46178-993-F57,2020-09-25,2020-12-01T08:57:18+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
107,"The Mental Health Effects of Living with Close Others Before, During, and After the Onset of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic not only threatens physical health, but is also a multi-faceted stressor that threatens mental health. Given the public health focus on staying home to stem the tide of COVID-19, it is crucial to determine how the close others we live with (i.e., romantic partners or children) affect our mental health, for better or worse. We examined the month-to-month mental health (i.e., well-being and ill-being) of parents living with child(ren) and people living with romantic partners (versus people not living with these close others) from February through September 2020 in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N=656; N=544). This longitudinal approach distinguishes three unique effects: differences existing before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, differences due to the onset of the pandemic, and differences that persisted across the first six months of the pandemic. In both samples, living with child(ren) or living with a romantic partner were both protective for mental health, before and during the first six months of the pandemic. Some evidence suggests these groups experienced unique increases in ill-being during the onset of the pandemic, but their ill-being also recovered more quickly. These findings highlight the crucial protective function of close relationships for mental health both in general and amidst a pandemic, suggesting that people living without these close others may need additional support.",Natalie M.

108,Can Mindfulness Help People Implement a Growth Mindset? Two Field Experiments in Hungary,"Does holding a growth mindset prevent people from experiencing potentially negative or maladaptive thoughts and feelings following academic setbacks? Not necessarily: In our Hungarian sample, a culture high in negative affect, three-fourths of people who endorsed a growth mindset at a maximum level nonetheless reported at least sometimes being judgmental of themselves and ruminating about setbacks. Thus, in two field experiments performed in Hungary, we incorporated mindfulness elements into an existing growth-mindset intervention (Yeager et al., 2019). These elements focused on accepting but distancing the self from negative thoughts and feelings in response to setbacks. This enhanced growth-mindset treatment significantly raised semester grades among university (N=251, Study 1, d=0.29) and reported grades among high school students (N=3,095, Study 2, d=0.17). A growth-mindset intervention alone also raised GPA with an effect size similar to the effect sizes found in prior research (Study 2); however, this effect did not consistently reach significance across models with the present sample size.

In Study 1 (N = 663), constructive patriotism was positively associated with support for intrinsic measures (e.g., raising awareness about health practices). Glorification was negatively linked to support for such measures and positively connected to support for extrinsic measures (e.g., closing the borders). In Study 2 (N = 522), constructive patriots showed greater compliance with hygiene and social distance practices. In Study 3 (N = 633), the attribution of responsibility for fighting the crisis to the State and particularly to individuals underlined the link between constructive patriotism and compliance with health practices.

110,Paternal Depression & Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed family functioning and increased parenting demands, leading to increased risk for poor psychosocial outcomes. Emerging evidence underscores the significant impact the pandemic has had on maternal mental health concerns. In contrast, paternal mental health has yet to be described. The current study describes the prevalence of depression and anxiety in fathers of young children as well as associated risk and protective factors. Methods: As part of the Parenting during the Pandemic study, fathers (N = 70) of children age 0-8 years old self-reported on mental health symptoms and additional concerns, while mothers (N = 236) provided a partner-report of father perinatal depression. Results:. Clinically significant depression (37.1%) and anxiety (22.9%) were prevalent in fathers. Partner reported perinatal depression was prevalent in 61.9% of fathers. Higher financial strain and previous mental health history were associated with increased risk of both depression and anxiety. Maternal report of paternal depression was associated with higher financial strain, greater number of children in the home, and lower maternal-reported marital quality. Limitations: The current study used cross-sectional data from an online cohort. The sample size limits the generalizability of the findings; future research should continue evaluating this important topic with larger samples. Conclusions: Compared to pre-pandemic population comparisons, paternal depression and anxiety are elevated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

111,Strengthened beliefs under psychedelics (SEBUS)? A Commentary on “REBUS and the Anarchic Brain: Toward a Unified Model of the Brain Action of Psychedelics”,"In introducing a model of “relaxed beliefs under psychedelics” (REBUS), Carhart-Harris and Friston (2019) have presented a compelling account of the effects of psychedelics on brain and mind. This model is contextualized within the Free Energy Principle (Friston et al., 2006; Friston, 2010), which may represent the first unified paradigm in the mind and life sciences. By this view, mental systems adaptively regulate their actions and interactions with the world via predictive models, whose dynamics are governed by a singular objective of minimizing prediction-error, or “free energy.” According to REBUS, psychedelics flatten the depth of free energy landscapes, or the differential attracting forces associated with various (Bayesian) beliefs, so promoting flexibility in inference and learning. Here, I would like to propose an alternative account of the effects of psychedelics that is in many ways compatible with REBUS, albeit with some important differences. Based on considerations of the distributions of 5-HT2a receptors within cortical laminae and canonical microcircuits for predictive coding, I propose that 5-HT2a agonism may also involve a strengthening of beliefs, particularly at intermediate levels of abstraction associated with conscious experience (Safron, 2020).",Adam Safron,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608D-58C-207,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608D-58C-207,2020-11-30,2020-11-30T07:50:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences,False

In Study 2, state-level collectivism positively related to both cases (r = .56) and deaths (r = .41) in simple regressions, and these relationships persisted after controlling for all covariates except race, where a state’s non-White population dominated all other predictors of COVID-19 cases (rp = .35) and deaths (rp = .31).

113,Quality of life of Health care professionals in pandemic times,"The COVID-19 pandemics were an event where there was a rupture of the life pattern and people felt helpless and suffering, creating a need for basic things such as medical care and shelter against the environmental conditions. The healthcare professionals faced an unknown potential threat to life that made them work in an intense and fearful routine facing fatigue and the fear to carry the disease to their families. In order to evaluate their Quality of life, we undertook a survey in the first months of the pandemics with logistical support of the Health ministry in Brazil reaching more than 200,000 varied health professionals, with quality of life data available to 97,379 . We segregated the professionals by their reported area in Medical doctor, psychologists, social worker, nurses, pharmaceutic/biochemistry, nutritionists, physiotherapist, and speech therapists. Here we describe the findings of the reported quality of life and the features more related to the worsening of the quality of life. The different professions report a diverse quality of life, suggesting a more heterogeneous pattern of impairment. The social relations domain of quality of life was the most affected in or sample Knowing the target population and the features related to worsening of quality of life might help to prepare the professionals for what they must face and to improve mental health in this population.",Jonas Jardim De Paula et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-D67-653,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-D67-653,2020-11-27,2020-11-29T02:57:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology,False
114,Transparency Is Necessary but Not Sufficient to Reduce Skepticism About a COVID-19 Vaccine,"Health authorities emphasize the importance of ""radical transparency"" in communicating about future COVID-19 vaccines to counter conspiracy-based skepticism. While this resonates with research that highlights uncertainty as a major psychological predictor of conspiracy-related beliefs, no systematic evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of transparency as communication strategy. This study tests the effects of transparent communication about a COVID-19 vaccine using a pre-registered experiment fielded to large, representative samples of Americans and Danes (N > 6,800). The evidence confirms that positive but vague vaccine communication does not increase vaccine support but rather infuses attitudes with conspiracy-related beliefs. Against the hopes of authorities, however, there is little evidence that transparency alone can reduce vaccine skepticism, unless this transparency discloses a highly safe and effective vaccine. Additional analyses suggest that this reflects that vaccine skepticism is not grounded in psychological uncertainty but in deep distrust of authorities, which impedes the effectiveness of their communication.",Michael Bang Petersen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46193-973-263,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46193-973-263,2020-11-28,2020-11-29T02:34:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; conspiracy; covid-19; vaccine; transparency,False
115,Assessing Self-Other Distinctions Through Decision-making Under Risk in The Era of Covid-19,"The current Covid-19 pandemic has demanded a degree of sacrifice from individuals for the sake of the greater good. Individuals have taken costly actions, both volitional and imposed, to reduce harm to strangers. The pandemic oers a unique opportunity to examine a fundamental question: where does the distinction between self and other lie? This question can be framed as a moral dilemma between competing motives of self-serving and pro-social behavior. Given the multifaceted uncer- tainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic, we propose to assess self-other distinction using models of decision-making under risk. We administered two surveys, where participants selected between sure and risky treatments for fictitious diseases, for themselves, a loved one and a stranger. Choice of treatment option showed risk-seeking tendencies that decreased with expected disease severity, across all targets, suggesting risk preferences for the other parallel those for the self. However, distinctions across targets emerged when decisions were conditioned on treatment cost, with sure treatments cho- sen more often for self and a close other; and sure treatment assigned a higher price for diseases with low expected severity, for self and other. These findings inform on what constitutes a measure of self-other distinction; and the limits of what can be asked of an individual in service to a stranger.",Leyla Loued-Khenissi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-DA1-4AD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46139-DA1-4AD,2020-11-27,2020-11-28T14:50:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Behavioral Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; risk; covid-19 pandemic; self-other distinction; decision-making,False
116,Are COVID-19 conspiracies a threat to public health? Psychological characteristics and health protective behaviours of believers,"The fast-changing COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to many conspiracy theories, and these have the potential to undermine public health measures and safeguarding behaviours. We conducted three studies before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom (UK) (n = 302, 404 and 399) to (i) identify the prevalence of COVID-19 conspiracy theories in the UK, (ii) map their socio-psychological predictors, and (iii) investigate their association with health safeguarding behaviours. We found COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs were prevalent (25% of participants endorsed at least one) and predicted by beliefs in unrelated conspiracies, a conspiracy mind-set, distrust in governmental authorities, education, and cognitive reflection. Unexpectedly, COVID-19 conspiracy believers adhered to basic health guidelines both before and after the lockdown as strictly as non-believers (e.g., washing hands, social distancing) and adopted more advanced health protective behaviours not (yet) officially recommended in the UK (e.g., wearing a mask, washing groceries with soap). Conspiracy believers were also more reluctant to install the contact-tracing app, get tested for and vaccinated against COVID-19 because of the perceived risks associated with these procedures. We discuss psychological characteristics that explain the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and people’s behaviours and intentions, and suggest practical recommendations for public health initiatives.",Marie Juanchich et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46118-4D8-E05,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46118-4D8-E05,2020-11-27,2020-11-28T14:39:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; covid; health; conspiracy theory; infodemic; false information; psychology,False

In this longitudinal study, sibling conflict in these families during and after the first lockdown in the United Kingdom was investigated. Online questionnaires were completed by 504 parents of young people with SENDs at four time points between 23rd March 2020 and 22nd October 2020 (over half completed the questionnaire at multiple time points). Young people with SENDs were more likely to be picked on or hurt by their siblings as lockdown progressed but there was no change in the rate at which they harmed or picked on their siblings. After lockdown, both perpetration and victimisation decreased. Young people with SENDs with the most severe needs were somewhat protected from sibling conflict.

Thus, in this study, we investigated the associations among the socioeconomic changes driven by the pandemic, mental health, life satisfaction (past, present, and future), and fear of COVID-19 in Japan. In total, 560 Japanese individuals took an online survey that included questions on their self-restraint and changing incomes and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale; and present, past, and future life satisfaction scale.

119,"Don’t put all social network sites in one basket: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and their relations with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Prior studies indicated that actively using social network sites (SNSs) is positively associated with well-being by enhancing social support and feelings of connectedness. Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being and using actively or passively various SNSs (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. Eight hundred and twenty-three persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures. Analyzes employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affects through social support. However, TikTok use was not associated with well-being and the only significant relation for Twitter was between active usage and lower satisfaction with life. Results are discussed in line with SNSs’ architectures and user’s motivations.

120,Pandemic leadership: Sex differences and their evolutionary–developmental origins,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global societal, economic, and social upheaval unseen in living memory. There have been substantial differences in the kinds of policies implemented by political decision-makers to prevent the spread of the virus, to test the population, and to manage infected patients. Among other factors, these policies vary with politicians’ sex: early findings indicate that, on average, female leaders seem more focused on minimizing direct human suffering caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while male leaders implement riskier short-term decisions, possibly aiming to minimize economic disruptions. These sex differences are consistent with broader findings in psychology, reflecting women’s stronger empathy, higher pathogen disgust, health concern, care-taking orientation, and dislike for the suffering of other people—as well as men’s higher risk-taking, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, narcissism, and focus on financial indicators of success and status. This review article contextualizes sex differences in pandemic leadership in an evolutionary framework. Evolution by natural selection is the only known process in nature that organizes populations of organisms into higher degrees of functional order, or counteracts the unavoidable disorder that would otherwise ensue, and is therefore essential for explaining the origins of human sex differences. Differential sexual selection and parental investment between males and females, together with the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain, drive sex differences in cognition and behavioral dispositions, underlying men’s and women’s leadership styles and decision-making during a global pandemic. We propose the sexually dimorphic leadership specialization hypothesis to explain how general psychobehavioral sex differences have been exapted during human evolution to create sexually dimorphic leadership styles. They may be facultatively co-opted by societies when facing different kinds of ecological and/or sociopolitical threats, such as disease outbreaks or intergroup aggression. Early evidence indicates that against the invisible viral foe that can bring nations to their knees, the strategic circumspection of empathic feminine health “worriers” may bring more effective and humanitarian outcomes than the devil-may-care incaution of masculine risk-taking “warriors”.",Severi Luoto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-253-C9D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46203-253-C9D,2020-11-26,2020-11-27T03:52:18+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; cognition; pandemic; population health; evolution; sexually dimorphic leadership specialization; leadership; sex differences; covid-19",False

The aim of the research was to verify the impact of the pandemic and its accompanying phenomena on the well-being of youth. In order to achieve this goal, the CAWI on-line survey method with double measurement was used. The first measurement carried out at the beginning of the quarantine resulted in 3659 filled out surveys in Poland and 739 in Ukraine. The second measurement conducted at the end of distance learning brought 1978 filled out surveys in Poland and 411 in Ukraine. The results of research indicate that the quarantine had a negative impact on the psychosocial condition of youth.

122,Improving preventive health behaviors in the COVID-19 crisis: a messaging intervention in a large nationally representative sample,"Public health communication play an important role in the fight against COVID-19. We used five well-established psychological levers to improve on the efficacy of two posters used by the French authorities (one on protective behaviors and one on proper handwashing). The five levers were: simplification (streamlining the posters), sunk costs (emphasizing the costs already paid to fight the pandemic), morality (emphasizing the duty to help others), self-protection (emphasizing the personal risks), and disgust (pointing out and illustrating that not following the protective behaviors or proper handwashing had consequences that should trigger disgust). We tested on a large (N = 3000) nationally representative French sample whether versions of the posters using these levers, compared to a control condition, were clearer, better recalled, and increased people’s intention to follow the posters’ recommendations. On the whole, there were no effects of the manipulations on any of the measures. The only consistent pattern was that the control protective behavior poster was better recalled than the alternatives (except for the simplified version), possibly because it contained one fewer message. The lack of effect on behavioral intentions might be attributed to the potential saturation in terms of health communication at the time of the experiment. Our results--mostly null and potentially negative--confirm the importance of testing interventions before using them in a public health campaign, even if they are grounded in successful past interventions.",Anne-Sophie Hacquin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-8FC-DDB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-8FC-DDB,2020-09-04,2020-11-26T20:41:06+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; public health communication; covid-19; behavioral intentions; psychological levers",False
123,Pandemic Compliance: A systematic review of influences on social distancing behaviour during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak,"During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigation measures compelling people to keep a safe social distance led to a massive, unprecedented behavioural change across the globe. The present study seeks to understand what variables made people comply with such mitigation measures. It systematically reviewed 45 studies with data about compliance behaviour during the first wave (found in searches from March 1st till June 30th 2020). The review shows that a combination of variables shaped compliance behaviour, including people’s fear of the virus, psychosocial factors (including impulsivity, negative emotions, self-efficacy, and social norms), institutional variables (including attitudes towards the mitigation measures, belief in conspiracy theories and knowledge of the virus), and situational variables (capacity to obey and opportunity to violate the rules). Notably, the reviewed studies did not find a significant association between law enforcement (perceived deterrence) and compliance here. The review assesses what these findings mean for behavioural theory and for policy makers seeking to mitigate pandemics like COVID-19. Also, it reflects on the limitations of the reviewed body of work and future directions for pandemic compliance research.",Emmeke Barbara Kooistra et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DB-72F-111,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DB-72F-111,2020-11-26,2020-11-26T16:24:16+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Forensic and Legal Psychology|Legal; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; social distancing; covid-19; systematic review; compliance; public health,False
124,Sexist Attitudes and Family Aggression during COVID-19 Lockdown,"The current research examined whether men’s hostile sexism was a risk factor for family-based aggression during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in which families were confined to the home for 5 weeks. Parents who had reported on their sexist attitudes and aggressive behavior toward intimate partners and children prior to the COVID-19 pandemic completed assessments of aggressive behavior toward their partners and children during the lockdown (N = 362 parents of which 310 were drawn from the same family). Accounting for pre-lockdown levels of aggression, men who more strongly endorsed hostile sexism reported greater aggressive behavior toward their intimate partners and their children during the lockdown. The contextual factors that help explain these longitudinal associations differed across targets of family-based aggression. Men’s hostile sexism predicted greater aggression toward intimate partners when men experienced low power during couples’ interactions, whereas men’s hostile sexism predicted greater aggressive parenting when men reported lower partner-child relationship quality. Novel effects also emerged for benevolent sexism. Men’s higher benevolent sexism predicted lower aggressive parenting, and women’s higher benevolent sexism predicted greater aggressive behavior toward partners, irrespective of power and relationship quality. The current study provides the first longitudinal demonstration that men’s hostile sexism predicts residual changes in aggression toward both intimate partners and children. Such aggressive behavior will intensify the health, well-being, and developmental costs of the pandemic, highlighting the importance of targeting power-related gender role beliefs when screening for aggression risk and delivering therapeutic and education interventions as families face the unprecedented challenges of COVID-19.",Nickola Overall,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A6-553-C75,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A6-553-C75,2020-11-25,2020-11-26T16:15:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; power; covid-19 lockdown; hostile sexism; intimate partner aggression; aggressive parenting,False
125,The Italian Covid-19 Psychological Research Consortium ( IT C19PRC): General Overview and Replication of the UK study,"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic represents a major stressor for the psychological health of people worldwide. In the UK, the Covid19-Psychological Research Consortium Study (C19PRC) launched to evaluate the psychological impact of Covid-19 in the general population and its implications. The project was then extended to Italy and several other countries. Purpose: this article provides an overview of the Italian C19PRC study and its replication of two specific findings from the UK C19PRC. In the first part, the relationship between anxiety and somatic symptomatology is examined. In the second part, we analyse the association between several factors and psychological health outcomes: depression/anxiety, traumatic stress, Covid-19 anxiety. Methods: in line with the study conducted in the UK, an online survey was administered to the adult Italian general population. The sample included 1038 respondents (age, mean = 49.94, SD = 16.14; 51.15% females) taken from four regions: Lombardia, Veneto, Lazio e Campania. The relationship between predictors and outcomes was evaluated by means of logistic regression models. Results: somatic indices showed a positive association with anxiety, worse somatic symptoms were associated with having had losses due to Covid-19 and with precarious health conditions. Females showed a higher incidence of psychological issues. No differences in anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress were found across regions but the Campania region showed the most severe somatic symptomatology. In the second analysis, the factors associated with more severe psychological outcomes (i.e., anxiety and/or depression, traumatic stress, and Covid-19 Related Anxiety) were younger age, the presence of minors in the household, traumatic stressors, and precarious health conditions. No differences across regions emerged. Discussions and conclusions: The Italian results correspond to the UK findings for anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress 1. Both in the UK and Italy, the factors associated with worse psychological health were gender (female), younger age, having children, pre-existing health issues (both for oneself or someone close), and the moderate/high perceived risk of contracting Covid-19 within one month. In Italy, unlike the UK, lower household income and having (had) Covid-19 were not associated with poorer mental health. The psychological impact of Covid-19 can last for months; future research should explore all aspects of the psychological burden of Covid-19 in order to implement psychological interventions and promote psychological health.",Giovanni Bruno et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-2B7-75F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-2B7-75F,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T18:48:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences,False
126,A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19,"Aim and Method: This perspective searches for evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period on the characteristics of mature gratitude in association with good mental health. Results: The results from the COVID-19 period suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Characteristics of mature gratitude such as trait and state gratitude, and spirituality and the awareness of being part of a larger whole can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future. Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.",Lilian Jans-Beken,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T18:39:28+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; virtues; clinical psychology; character strengths; corona; positive psychology",False

Among the factors assessed in the study, attitudes towards vaccine was most strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccination intentions, followed by trust in mass media, and social norms. While COVID-19 knowledge was associated with COVID-19 vaccine intention, it was not associated with willingness to pay or get on a COVID-19 vaccine list.

128,Adolescent Behavioral Health Problems are Associated with Parent Perceptions of Evidence-Based Therapy and Preferences when Seeking Therapeutic Support,"Informational materials from psychological associations often encourage parents to seek out “evidence-based therapies” (EBTs) to address their child’s behavioral health concerns. This study examined whether parents concerned about their adolescents’ substance use had distinct preferences for EBT principles and marketing language based on their adolescent’s specific behavioral health problems. Parents (N = 411; 86% female; 88% non-Hispanic White) of adolescents (age 12-19 years) completed an online direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing survey as part of a larger multi-phase study. Parents reported their adolescents had high rates of current externalizing (66%), internalizing (51%), substance-related (39%), and legal (25%) problems. Parents answered questions about their perceived definition of EBT, whether they valued underlying EBT principles (i.e., reliance on a proven approach vs. a varied approach), their preferred terms for describing EBT, and factors they considered when choosing a therapist. Most parents defined EBT correctly, regardless of their adolescent’s behavioral health problems. Parents of adolescents with internalizing or legal problems were less likely to value EBT principles, with legal problems emerging as the more important multivariate predictor. Additionally, parents of adolescents with substance-related or legal problems had distinct preferences for the terms used to describe EBTs.

129,Validation to Spanish version of the COVID-19 Stress Scale,"There is a global consensus about the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to affect people's mental health. In this context, and prior to the formulation of mitigation strategies, tools are required that allow an objective and effective assessment of mental health risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of COVID-19 Stress Scale, formulated by Taylor et al. (2020), based on the concept of COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. A national sample of 1214 participating adults was taken in Colombia, who answered a translated version of the scale. Evidence of a hexa-dimensional structure was obtained whose goodness of fit indicators were Chi2 = 1215,759, Sig. =. 000, CMIN / DF = 2.202, RMSEA = .044, NFI = .943, TLI = .964, CFI =. 968 and FMIN = 1,967. Regarding reliability, an α = .924 and Spearman-Brown = .824 were obtained for the entire scale; the reliability indicators of the 6 subscales were also high. The similarities and differences in the findings with respect to the original psychometric study of the scale are discussed, as well as the utility and importance of the instrument as a tool in future efforts to mitigate the psychosocial effects of the pandemic",Edgar Guillermo Pulido et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F14-C77,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-F14-C77,2020-11-24,2020-11-25T17:32:33+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Psychometrics; stress; mental health; validity; pandemic; reliability; covid-19,False
130,"Lived experience related to the COVID-19 pandemic among Arabic-, Russian- and Somali-speaking migrants in Finland","Increasing research shows that migrants are disproportionally exposed to COVID-19 disease. However, little is known about their lived experience and related meaning-making. This qualitative study maps COVID-19-related experiences among respondents from three migrant groups living in Finland: Somali-, Arabic- and Russian-speakers (N = 209). The data was collected by telephone interviews over four weeks in March and April 2020. Using inductive thematical analysis, we identified seven themes that illustrate respondents’ multifaceted lived experiences during the first phase of pandemic. The themes depict respondents’ difficulties and fears, but also their resilience and resources to cope, both individually and collectively. Experiences varied greatly between individuals and migrant groups. The main conclusion is that although the COVID-19 pandemic may be an especially stressful experience for migrant populations, it may also provide opportunities to deepen cooperation and trust within migrant communities, and between migrants and their country of settlement. Our analysis suggests that cooperation between local authorities and migrants, trust-building and effective information-sharing can foster positive and functional adaptations to disease-related threats and changing social environments.",Eerika Finell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46106-4A9-4DE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46106-4A9-4DE,2020-11-24,2020-11-25T17:23:30+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; pandemic; disease-related threats; migrants; covid-19; health; experiences,False
131,"""No way out except from external intervention"": First-hand accounts of autistic inertia","This study, called for by autistic people and led by an autistic researcher, is the first to explore ‘autistic inertia’, a widespread and often debilitating difficulty initiating action. Previous research has considered initiation only in the context of social interaction or experimental conditions. This study is unique in considering difficulty initiating tasks of any type in real life settings, and by gathering qualitative data directly from autistic people. Four face-to-face and 2 online (text) focus groups were conducted with 32 autistic adults (19 female, 8 male, 5 other), aged 23-64 who were able to express their internal experiences in words. They articulate in detail the actions they have difficulty with, what makes it easier or harder to act, and the impact on their lives. Thematic analysis of the transcripts found four overarching themes: descriptions of inertia, scaffolding to support action, the influence of wellbeing, and the impact on day-to-day activities. Participants described difficulty starting, stopping and changing activities that was not within their conscious control. While difficulty with planning was common, a subset of participants described a profound impairment in initiating even simple actions more suggestive of a movement disorder. Prompting and compatible activity in the environment promoted action, while mental health difficulties and stress exacerbated difficulties. Inertia had pervasive effects on participants’ day-to-day activities and wellbeing. This overdue research opens the door to many areas of further investigation to better understand autistic inertia and effective support strategies.",Karen Leneh Buckle et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-EFF-E43,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D8-EFF-E43,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T17:20:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Neuropsychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Neurodevelopmental Disorders; asd; initiation; movement; catatonia; inertia; autism; autistic adults; qualitative,False
132,Anxious and Angry: Emotional and Political Motives for Approving of and Complying with Hygiene Measures related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic elicits a vast amount of collective anxiety, which may also have broader societal and political implications. In the current study, we investigate the individual and social impact of this anxiety. We conducted an online survey in four different countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK; N=2031), examining whether anxiety about the Coronavirus leads to more approval of and compliance with hygiene measures deployed in those countries, and what role political beliefs play at this. We found significant differences between the four countries, with Spain marking highest anxiety as well as approval of and compliance with hygiene measures. Furthermore, three linear regressions showed that one’s anxiety is not only predicted by proximity to sources of infection (age, country, oneself or friends being infected), but also by political views (populist attitudes, anger at the government). Importantly, people who are anxious are also angry, at transgressors of hygiene rules or at their government. Thus, anger does not reduce one’s fear, but fear leads to more anger, especially in countries with the highest infection rates. Anxiety also leads to more approval of and compliance with hygiene measures, but again anger and political beliefs play a role in this relation. Whereas behavioral compliance is more predicted by fear and anger at others who transgress the rules, approval of the measures is better predicted by anxiety about the impact of Coronavirus and anger at the government.",David Abadi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-5DD-928,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604C-5DD-928,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T17:19:19+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prejudice and Discrimination; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Violence and Aggression; conspiracy mentality; anxiety; emotions; covid-19; populism; anger,False
133,Prosocial behaviours under collective quarantine conditions. A latent class analysis study during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Italy,"Aim. To identify patterns of prosocial behaviours under collective quarantine conditions. Method. Survey data was collected from a sample of Italian adults during the March ̶ May 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Participants reported on offline and online prosocial behaviours, Sense of Community Responsibility (SoC-R) and perceptions of community resilience. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used for data analysis. Results. A total of 4,045 participants completed the survey and 2,562 were eligible (72% female; mean age 38.7 years). LCA revealed four classes of prosocial behaviours: Money donors (7%), Online & offline helpers (59%), Online health information sharers (21%), and Neighbour helpers (13%). The classes were partially invariant across age groups (18 ̶ 35 and > 35 years). Being a man and higher SoC-R scores were associated with belonging to the Online & offline helper class. Members of this class also reported the greatest perceptions of community resilience. Conclusions.

134,The Impact of School Closure and Social Isolation on Children in Vulnerable Families during COVID-19: A Focus on Children’s Reactions,"The COVID-19 public health measures may have long-term consequences for children into adulthood. By exploring children’s reactions more broadly, including both positive and negative reactions, we are better placed to understanding the breadth of implications of home school and social isolation under COVID-19. The present study explored how COVID-19 related variables including home school experience, family stress and instability, screen time use, missing friends and worry about virus infection are associated with children’s emotional, somatic/cognitive and worry reactions, respectively. Data were drawn from the longitudinal [study name blinded for peer review]-study and a series of hierarchical linear regression models were applied controlling for children’s gender, age and psychological vulnerability. Results showed significant associations between all three outcomes and all COVID-19 related predictors, except for screen time use. Further, age moderated several of these associations and older children were more negatively impacted (i.e., higher level of reported reactions). The present study provides more conclusive evidence of the effects of home school and social isolation under COVID-19 on children’s. It also exemplifies the importance of focusing on the children’s reactions more broadly, as there was evidence that children had fewer emotional reactions compared to before the pandemic.",Linda Larsen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F9-00C-5ED,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F9-00C-5ED,2020-11-25,2020-11-25T07:58:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; home school; missing friends; covid-19; family stress; screen time use; covid-19 worries; social isolation; child reactions,False
135,Face masks reduce emotion-recognition accuracy and perceived closeness,"Face masks became the symbol of the global fight against the coronavirus. While face masks’ medical benefits are clear, little is known about their psychological consequences. Drawing on theories of the social functions of emotions and rapid trait impressions, we tested hypotheses on face masks’ effects on emotion-recognition accuracy and social judgments (perceived trustworthiness, likability, and closeness). Our preregistered study with 191 German adults revealed that face masks diminish people’s ability to accurately categorize an emotion expression and make target persons appear less close. Exploratory analyses further revealed that face masks buffered the negative effect of negative (vs. non-negative) emotion expressions on perceptions of trustworthiness, likability, and closeness. Associating face masks with the coronavirus’ dangers predicted higher perceptions of closeness for masked but not for unmasked faces. By highlighting face masks’ effects on social functioning, our findings inform policymaking and point at contexts where alternatives to face masks are needed.",Felix Grundmann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46038-88F-4D0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46038-88F-4D0,2020-10-09,2020-11-24T11:42:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social judgments; perceived closeness; emotion perception; face masks; coronavirus,False
136,"Regional Personality Differences Predict Variation in COVID-19 Infections, Deaths and Social Distancing Behavior","Social and compliance behaviors play a critical role in the transmission of COVID-19. Consequently, regional variation in personality traits that capture individual differences in these behaviors may offer new insight into the spread of COVID-19. We combine self-reported personality data (3.5M people), COVID-19 prevalence and death rates, and behavioral mobility observations (29M people) to show that regional personality differences in the US and Germany predict COVID-19-related outcomes and behaviors incremental to a conservative set of socio-demographic, economic, and pandemic-related control variables. Earlier onsets of COVID-19 and steeper initial growth rates were related to higher levels of Openness and lower levels of Neuroticism. We also show that (i) regional personality is associated with objective indicators of social distancing, (ii) the effects of regional personality can change over time (Openness), and that (iii) the effects of regional personality do not always converge with those observed at the individual level (Agreeableness and Conscientiousness).",Heinrich Peters et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-F45-EB8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46248-F45-EB8,2020-08-06,2020-11-24T01:11:06+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; social distancing; regional personality; covid-19; big five,False
137,Stay at Home! When Personality Profiles Influence Psychological Adjustment and Creativity during the COVID-19 Outbreak,"With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to “stay at home”. Although research suggests that social isolation affects health and wellbeing, reactions may vary depending on individuals, and their preference for solitude. This study aimed to identify personality profiles, and examine whether these profiles were associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. French respondents (N = 430) filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in Spring 2020. The questionnaire comprised information on lockdown conditions, measures of psychological adjustment and performance on a series of creative tasks. Based on measures of individuals’ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, the cluster analysis revealed three profiles: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with “Affiliation” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a creative insight task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns. With this knowledge, health professionals could develop appropriate interventions to accompany high-risk individuals in situations of social isolation.",Estelle Michinov et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0,2020-06-22,2020-11-23T13:29:36+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; personality profiles; social isolation; covid-19; creativity; preference for solitude,False

It is theorised that health risks, loss of employment, and economic downturn precipitated by COVID-19 produced distress, and that confidence in government, social belonging, and sense of community may mitigate against pandemic distress. However, theories of pandemic distress mitigation remain untested. Here, we compare longitudinal responses from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS), March 26th to April 12th, 2020 (lockdown), with participants’ pre-COVID-19 baselines from the previous year (N=940) to investigate pandemic distress mechanisms during New Zealand's first stringent national lockdown.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-E43-30B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CE-E43-30B,2020-11-23,2020-11-23T12:26:56+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; anxiety; lockdown; well being; longitudinal; employment; stan; bayesian; kessler-6; alert level-4,False
139,Families face pandemic – A review of psychological suggestions and empirical findings regarding the Covid-19 pandemic,"Aims. Even though child psychology researches related to a pandemic are extensive, the knowledge of practitioners about interventions and practices is still very limited. The complete novelty of such an epidemic situation in Europe, the diversity of terminology and methods are factors that make results hard to interpret. Therefore, the current study aims to give an overview of the psychological literature of the family aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods. A search was executed in four databases (Science Direct, Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar) using the following keywords: pandemic, Covid 19, family, children, adolescents, anxiety, depression. Our review focuses only on English language literature. Results. The majority of the articles focus on non-pathological phenomena and draws attention to the behavior of healthy populations (increase in internet use, the decline of concentration). Methods were dominated by online surveys. These surveys were mainly constructed ad-hoc and they preferred to address parents. Direct child investigations are underrepresented, but several suggestions were formulated for their optimal functioning. Conclusion:. Researches focusing on psychopathology emphasize the growth in the prevalence of disorders. However, other researches are needed to explore the psychodynamics of the pandemic on the family level. Our study aimed to contribute to the field by summarizing the main findings, suggestions, and interventions hoping that it might be a useful tool for practitioners and reduce the territory of the unknown.",Krisztina Dr Törő et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-A62-2A0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-A62-2A0,2020-11-21,2020-11-23T11:26:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; pandemic; developmental psychology; domestic violence; adolescents; review; stress; risk; covid-19; family; perceived stress,False

This paper describes the execution of the third wave of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during July-August 2020. Methods: Adults (N=2025) who previously participated in the baseline and/or the first follow-up surveys were reinvited to participate in this survey, which assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders; as well as the role of (3) psychological factors and (4) social and political attitudes, in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure that the cross-sectional sample is nationally representative in terms of gender, age, household income, household composition, and urbanicity. Results: 1166 adults (57.6% of baseline participants) were successfully recontacted and provided full interviews at Wave 3. As expected, the raking procedure successfully re-balanced the cross-sectional sample to within 1% of population estimates across the selected socio-demographic characteristics.

141,Caring for Coronavirus Healthcare Workers: Lessons Learned from Long-Term Monitoring of Military Peacekeepers,"Background: The current outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is of unprecedented proportions in several regards. Recent reports suggest that many frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) suffer from mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Previous studies have identified several key factors associated with short-term PTSS in pandemic HCWs, yet limited data is available on factors associated with long-term PTSS. Understanding the psychological impact of the pandemic on healthcare workers, is important in planning for future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. In the current study, we look to findings from a highly relevant subsection of the trauma field, the military domain. Objective: Pandemic HCWs and military peacekeepers may experience similar stressors in the line of duty. This study investigated whether factors linked to short-term PTSS in pandemic HCWs were also associated with long-term PTSS in military peacekeepers. Materials and Methods: Peacekeepers who reported pandemic-relevant stressors during deployment to a UN peacekeeping mission were included in the study (N = 1,627). PTSS was self-reported using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Military Version. Descriptive instruments were used to assess possible factors associated with PTSS. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between these factors and PTSS. Results: Our model accounted for 50% of the variance in PTSS, F(1503,11) = 139.00, p < .001. Age, relationship- and employment status, as well as preparedness, working environment, social support after deployment, barriers to disclose, recognition, and loneliness, were all significantly associated with PTSS on average 30 years after deployment. The most important risk factors of long-term PTSS were personal barriers to disclose one’s experiences and current unemployment. Conclusions: Several factors linked to short-term PTSS in pandemic HCWs were associated with long-term PTSS in peacekeepers. We discuss how these findings may be used to prevent long-term PTSS in HCWs involved in the current COVID-19 outbreak.",Christer Lunde Gjerstad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-54B-D37,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-54B-D37,2020-06-10,2020-11-23T10:03:43+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; resilience (psychologhical); ptsd - posttraumatic stress disorder; military; health care workers (hcw); covid-19; mental health,False
142,Examining temporal interactions between loneliness and depressive symptoms and the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties among UK residents during the COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal results from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study,"Background Longitudinal studies examining the temporal association between mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak are needed. It is important to determine how relationships between mental health outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. Method Data was gathered over 4 months (March – June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearson’s product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. Results The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. Limitations Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both.

143,"Conspiratorial thinking during COVID-19: The roles of paranoia, delusion-proneness, and intolerance of uncertainty","The COVID-19 global pandemic has left many feeling a sense of profound uncertainty about their world, safety, and livelihood. Information that can help make sense of this uncertainty is offered by both official health-organizations as well as sources espousing misinformation and conspiracy theories. Individuals high in intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be particularly impacted by the impoverished epistemic environment and may thus be more drawn to conspiratorial thinking (CT). In the present study we show that endorsement of COVID-19-specific conspiracy theories is associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty as well as anxiety, delusion-proneness, and paranoid ideation. Furthermore, delusion-proneness and paranoia explained the relationship between IU and CT, and emerged as independent partial predictors of CT even when controlling for other facets of schizotypy. In contrast, anxiety did not explain the relationship between IU and CT, suggesting a stronger role of cognitive traits as opposed to affective factors. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of individual differences in IU, delusion proneness and paranoia in the development of CT in the context of the acute uncertainty of a global crisis, in which CT is more prevalent and salient. Informational intervention designs may benefit from leveraging the body of work demonstrating the efficacy of targeting IU to incite meaningful changes in thinking.",Emmett M.

144,"Age Advantages of Emotional Experience during the COVID-19 Pandemic are Robust, but Diminished Compared to Pre-pandemic Conditions","Getting old is generally seen as unappealing, yet aging confers considerable advantages in several psychological domains (North & Fiske, 2015). In particular, older adults are better off emotionally than younger adults, with aging associated with the so-called “age advantages,” that is, more positive and less negative emotional experiences (Carstensen et al., 2011). Although the age advantages are well established, it is less clear whether they occur under conditions of prolonged stress. In a recent study, Carstensen et al (2020) demonstrated that the age advantages persist during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting that older adults are able to utilise cognitive and behavioural strategies to ameliorate even sustained stress. Here, we build on Carstensen and colleagues’ work with two studies. In Study 1, we provide a large-scale test of the robustness of Carstensen and colleagues’ finding that older individuals experience more positive and less negative emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured positive and negative emotions along with age information in 23,629 participants in 63 countries in April-May 2020. In Study 2, we provide a comparison of the age advantages using representative samples collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We demonstrate that older people experience less negative emotion than younger people during the prolonged stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the advantage of older adults was diminished during the pandemic, pointing to a likely role of older adults use of situation selection strategies (Charles, 2010).",Rui Sun et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46017-FB3-577,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46017-FB3-577,2020-11-19,2020-11-20T16:48:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion,False
145,Infection control in the home: A qualitative study exploring perceptions and experiences of adhering to protective behaviours in the household during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: Recommended behaviours to protect from COVID-19 in the home include cleaning, handwashing, social distancing, spending time in your own room and wearing a face-covering in close proximity to people. Evidence is accumulating that following these behaviours can help protect against COVID-19, but adherence is mixed. This study sought to understand people’s perceptions of following these protective behaviours in the home to inform the adaptation of an online infection control intervention: Germ Defence. Methods: Thirteen participants were interviewed by telephone about their perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and their experiences of protecting themselves at home. Members of the public were purposively sampled via the Germ Defence website from a database of 971 volunteers, and from social media to complete thinkaloud interviews about their perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic and their experiences of protecting themselves at home. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Open-ended qualitative survey data from 124 participants sampled from the Germ Defence database were categorised inductively and mapped onto the themes in order to supplement the interview data. Results: Thematic analysis generated 7 major themes; perceived risk, belief in the efficacy of protective behaviours, acceptability of the behaviours, having capacity to perform the behaviours, the perceived effort involved, having the confidence to perform the behaviours, and social norms affect motivation to engage in the behaviours. The survey data mapped well onto these themes, strengthening the concepts generated through the interviews. Cleaning and handwashing were widely perceived to be effective and acceptable, although some participants described how other members of their household were less adherent to these behaviours which could cause anxiety. Behaviours such as spending time in separate rooms at home and social distancing were often seen as less acceptable, especially when no-one in the household has any symptoms. However, people were also aware that only putting these behaviours into practice once symptoms had developed would likely mean the virus had already spread within the home, which made them feel powerless or confused. Discussion: People felt more empowered when they understood that even small changes, such as spending some time apart, were worthwhile in order to reduce exposure and lessen viral load.",Katherine Morton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-42A-3EB,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609F-42A-3EB,2020-09-02,2020-11-20T15:48:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; self-isolation; covid-19; infection control; perceptions; social distancing; qualitative,False
146,Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology,"Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. This study investigates (a) potential risk and resilience factors for loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic and (b) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10061 respondents was unproportionate in terms of gender and educational level and thus sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify potential risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Among the stable factors, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with small effect sizes. Among the state risk factors, more rumination and worry in general were associated with stronger loneliness, showing a medium effect size. Among the coping behaviors examined, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a small effect size. Loneliness was associated with both depression and anxiety with small effect sizes when all potential confounders and psychiatric diagnosis were controlled for. The relationship to depression was more marked than the relationship to anxiety. Conclusions: The findings suggest that singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected by loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety symptoms. The results of the analysis of potential risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.

147,Toward Data-Based Case Conceptualization: A Functional Analysis Approach With Ecological Momentary Assessment,"Network analyses and process-based approaches to psychotherapy are thrilling developments for psychotherapy research and practice, but they lack a therapeutic rationale for the individual selection of treatment modules. Conceptualizing the conditional relations around human responses using functional analysis could guide case conceptualization and treatment planning. In a pilot study with four participants (a 30- and a 25-year-old man; a 19- and a 44-year-old woman), we developed and tested the feasibility and acceptance of an assessment that comprises elements of functional analysis for participants with emotional disorders. We assessed an individualized set of items three times per day, for a period of 30 days, with ecological momentary assessment while participants were waiting for psychotherapy. The implementation proved to be both feasible and accepted; participants did not report any side effects. Three datasets were included in the analysis; one had to be excluded because the minimum response rate of 80% (out of 90 data points) was not met. P-factor and network analyses revealed meaningful behavioral clusters (e.g., participant 1: hopelessness, procrastination, coping, avoidance). The assessment is a promising diagnostic tool that helps participants and therapists identify and systemize relevant behavior patterns and to draw conclusions for treatment planning.",Saskia Scholten et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-ED2-B84,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-ED2-B84,2020-08-24,2020-11-20T08:54:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; ecological momentary assessment; network analysis; functional analysis; case conceptualization; anxiety; depression,False
148,The psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis on young Swiss men participating in a cohort study,"Aims The COVID-19 pandemic caused many disturbances to daily life worldwide and may also have significantly affected people’s psychological well-being. The present study aimed to describe the psychological impact of the crisis on our sample of young Swiss men and to examine differences due to their linguistic region, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and living arrangements. Method Based on an ongoing cohort study, we assessed a general-population sample of young Swiss men (n = 2345; average 29 years old) shortly before (from April 2019) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (between 13 May and 8 June 2020). This was a unique opportunity to estimate the crisis’ psychological impact in form of depression, perceived stress and sleep quality (assessed before and during COVID-19), and any crisis-induced fears, isolation or psychological trauma. Associations of psychological impact with living arrangements, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and linguistic region (German-speaking vs French-speaking) were investigated using linear regression models. Findings By the time participants responded to our questionnaire, less than 1% had been tested positive for COVID-19, 2.6% had been tested negative, and 14.7% had had some COVID-19 symptoms but had not been tested. About 8.2% of the sample reported at least some symptoms of psychological trauma (≥ 24 points on the Impact of Event Scale). On average, participants reported higher levels of fear for others (43.6% at least moderate) and economical fear (12.7% at least moderate) than fear for themselves (5.8% at least moderate). Those living alone and those who reported having COVID-19 symptoms themselves, or knowing someone with symptoms, reported higher overall psychological impact in the form of depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation. Associations with linguistic region varied by outcome, with higher levels of depression and fear in French-speaking regions and higher levels of perceived stress and isolation in German-speaking regions. Interpretation The crisis had a considerable impact on the psychological well-being of our sample of young Swiss men, and some groups were more affected than others: those living alone and those who had shown COVID-19 symptoms themselves; or had known someone with symptoms, may have felt a greater psychological impact from the crisis. Supporting those at a higher risk of psychological consequences in such crises, whether through structural measures or via individual support, should be an important aspect of crisis management and could help reduce the overall impact of the current pandemic on Switzerland’s population.",Simon Marmet et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C7-39C-082,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C7-39C-082,2020-11-19,2020-11-19T16:42:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; switzerland; psychological impact; covid-19; mental health,False
149,Understanding COVID-19 through a complex trauma lens: Implications for effective psychosocial responses,"DO NOT CITE WITHOUT AUTHOR PERMISSION. The psychosocial impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on individuals, families, and communities will likely persist for years to come. While briefing notes informed by disaster psychology and crisis management have been released to guide social workers and other mental health professionals in their work during the pandemic, the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 may require inclusion of additional theories of trauma and resilience. Thus, we first examine the application of complex trauma theory as an effective framework for assessing the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic, especially among individuals with prior trauma exposure, those with pre-existing mental illness, and communities affected by marginalization and historical trauma. We then discuss the importance of using trauma-informed practice to address the effects of the pandemic on both the individual and community levels during this unprecedented moment in history.",Lcsw J.

150,Explaining the association of race and COVID-19 vaccination intentions: the role of behavioral beliefs and trust in COVID-19 information sources,"The development of a COVID-19 vaccine is a critical strategy for combatting the pandemic. However, in order for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who have already been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. In this study, we investigate potential causes of this disparity, focusing on vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n=889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccine beliefs explain the lower vaccine intentions reported by Black participants compared to non-Black participants. However, while we find associations between trust in information sources and vaccine beliefs, we do not find evidence that differences in trust accounted for the observed differences in vaccine beliefs by race. Furthermore, we found evidence of moderation; the association of trust in two sources, Trump and public health officials and agencies, with beliefs were smaller among Black participants. Overall, our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccine beliefs. This relationship warrants further investigation.",Chioma Woko et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CC-73B-60C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CC-73B-60C,2020-11-18,2020-11-19T02:36:54+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; vaccination; covid-19; vaccine hesitancy; media; health information sources,False
151,Keeping Kids Busy: Family Factors Associated with Hands-on Play and Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Parent-child interactions are crucial for child development. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected mental health and increased parenting challenges impacting parent-child functioning. The aim of the current study was to examine the relationship between parent factors and child activities to identify parental needs. A convenience sample of parents (N = 708), primarily mothers (n = 610; 87.4%) aged 35.59 years old (SD = 5.59; range = 21-72), with children ages 2-8 years completed an online questionnaire between April 14-June 1, 2020. Participants mostly resided in Canada and had an income of >$100,000. Parent-child activities were measured as total weekly time and combined time across activities within two categories: hands-on play and screen time. Bivariate correlations informed block-wise linear regression models. For families with childcare needs, parental anxiety was associated with higher total hands-on play (F(3,142) = 14.01, p < .001), combined hands-on play (F(2,85) = 6.82, p = .011), and combined screen time (F(2,82) = 6.25, p = .014). Families without childcare needs indicated parenting stress was associated with lower total hands-on play (F(3,212) = 7.95, p < .005) and combined hands-on play (F(2,110) = 5.67, p = .019), and higher supervised screen time (F(3,138) = 6.14, p = .014). Family structure and indices of socioeconomic status were also predictive of activities across childcare needs and child ages. To promote high-quality parent-child interactions and positive developmental outcomes in the pandemic, policy makers should support childcare needs, parent mental health and stress, and provide evidence-based guidelines for child screen time.",Shaelyn Stienwandt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F1-5FD-A8C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F1-5FD-A8C,2020-11-17,2020-11-18T19:01:26+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; parent-child interactions; parenting; hands-on play; screen-time,False
152,A Rapid Scoping Review of Publications Examining Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 in China,"Objective: Despite the surge of publications examining the psychological impacts of COVID-19 in China, little was reported about effective solutions. The gap necessitates a timely literature synthesis. Methods: A rapid scoping review was conducted in major English and Chinese databases, ArXivs, and trial registries. Two researchers independently extracted data following the PRISMA guideline. Results: Screening of publications led to 102 English and 322 Chinese publications between December 31st, 2019, and June 15th, 2020. The majority resembled ""Problem Admiration"" efforts of commentaries on policies or guidelines (35.38%), and cross-sectional surveys (53.54%) that documented the prevalence and types of psychopathology in China during the pandemic. Although the publications unanimously called for clinical trials, solution-focused studies were scarce (2.12%).

153,Predicting behavioral intentions to prevent or mitigate COVID-19: A meta-analysis,"We examined the effectiveness of attitudes, social norms and perceived behavioral control on behavioral intentions and behaviors that prevent and mitigate COVID-19 infections and collateral negative consequences. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis with 29 effect sizes from 19 studies involving data from 11 countries (N = 15,328). We found strongest effects for perceived behavioral control, but also moderately strong effects of social norms. This is practically important in a pandemic environment because social norms in other health contexts typically show negligible effects and advice based on non-pandemic contexts may be misguided. Examining moderator effects, we are the first to demonstrate that in contexts with strong endorsement of social norms, norm-behavior effects were strengthened. Focusing on societal level differences, both wealth and individualism increased the strength of association between perceived behavioral control and behavioral intentions.

154,"Can Mental Health Apps Be Effective for Depression, Anxiety, and Stress During a Pandemic?","Covid-19 is poised to exacerbate the global mental health crisis as social isolation, unemployment, and economic recession are risk factors for negative mental health consequences. Since the need for social distancing can make face-to-face services less accessible, people may turn to mental health apps as an accessible and inexpensive solution. But are the claims about the efficacy of these apps supported by evidence? We identified 19 published articles on PubMed of peer-reviewed randomized clinical trials of mental health apps focused on stress, anxiety, and depression. Despite some evidence for the effectiveness of mental health apps, it remains unclear how effective these apps are compared to standard of care. Populations studied so far also lack diversity, making it difficult to generalize any benefits to racial minorities and low-income individuals—the very people who have been most negatively impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and traditionally have higher barriers to mental health services. While apps are not a substitute for face-to-face therapy, further evidence is warranted given their potential for delivering scalable, low-cost care to patients. We call for regulatory oversight as a means to ensure mental health apps demonstrate safety and effectiveness prior to marketing.",Robert L.

155,Clinical and functional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing on Veterans with psychotic disorders and recently-housed Veterans,"Background: The COVID pandemic has upended the daily lives of everyone in the United States, negatively impacting social interactions, work, and living situations. The pandemic could lead to or exacerbate mental health issues, especially in people who are already vulnerable to such effects. Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system two populations vulnerable to social and functional disruptions include those who have recently experienced homelessness (recently housed Veterans, RHV) and those who have a psychotic disorder (PSY). Methods and Findings: We conducted phone interviews with PSY (n = 81), RHV (n = 76) and control Veterans (CTL, n = 74) between mid-May – mid-August, 2020 (“current”) and a retrospective assessment relative to January, 2020 (“pre-COVID”). We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., family and social functioning, work) at both time periods, and risk and protective factors (e.g., resilience, uncertainty) for the current period. The two vulnerable groups had higher levels of clinical symptoms and poorer community integration relative to CTL, as expected. Regarding the effect of the pandemic, results showed that all three groups experienced worse clinical outcomes (i.e., increased depression, anxiety, loneliness) currently vs. pre-COVID; there were no significant interactions between group and time period indicating all three groups were equally impacted by the pandemic. For community integration, there was a small but significant decrease in social networks in all three groups currently vs. pre-COVID. RHV showed a small but significant increase in independent living relative to pre-COVID ratings. Finally, RHV had greater levels of intolerance of uncertainty compared to PSY and CTL. Conclusions: Our results indicate that vulnerable and non-vulnerable Veterans were equally negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of a disproportionate effect of the pandemic on the vulnerable groups may be due to the availability and utilization of comprehensive VA services available to vulnerable Veterans (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.",Jonathan Wynn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F5-5E8-C58,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F5-5E8-C58,2020-11-17,2020-11-18T14:00:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; recently housed; community integration; veterans; covid19; clinical; psychosis; coronavirus,False

Yet, their benefits are often questioned and adherence is variable. Methods: We examined in representative samples across eight countries (N = 7,568) whether adherence reported around June 1, 2020 predicted the increase in Covid-19 mortality by August 31, 2020. Results: Mortality increased 81.3% in low adherence countries (United States, Sweden, Poland, Russia), 8.4% in high adherence countries (Germany, France, Spain, United Kingdom). Across countries adherence and subsequent mortality increases correlated with r = -0.91. Limitations: No African or South American countries were included in the present study, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

157,Does Emotional Well-Being Mediate Between the Association of Peer Support and Depressive Symptoms in University Students During COVID-19 Pandemic?,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected individuals’ mental health. Social isolation as a result of social distancing during the pandemic potentially affects the associations among perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depression in university students. The present study examined the associations among perceived available peer support, emotional well-being (as indicated negatively by loneliness and negative affects, and indicated positively by positive affects and hope), and depressive symptoms in university students. During the 3rd stage of the outbreak in July, 2020, 255 students at a public university in Hong Kong participated in an online-based survey which assessed their perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depressive symptoms. Results showed that perceived available peer support negatively contributed to depressive symptoms; both negative and positive indicators of emotional well-being mediated the association between perceived available peer support and depressive symptoms. The university students showed signs of depressive symptoms, highlighting the need for preventive efforts and increased access to mental health care that supports the psychological and emotional needs of young people during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Yao Sun et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-7A0-B7D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-7A0-B7D,2020-11-17,2020-11-18T01:12:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; covid-19; emotional well-being; depressive symptoms; positive and negative affects; loneliness; peer support; hope,False
158,Standalone smartphone CBT-based Ecological Momentary Interventions to increase mental health - a narrative review,"Introduction: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphone with the aim to increase the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and provide scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles which are considered as a gold standard for the treatment of many mental health problems. Objective: This review aimed to investigate standalone smartphone-based ‘ecological momentary interventions’ (EMIs) to improve mental health, that were built based on principles derived from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between 1st January 2007 and 15th January 2020. We included studies with a focus on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, and/or efficacy and/or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, e.g., app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, i.e., choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in primary outcomes used in the studies. Results: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (m=70.8%), and outcomes were satisfying by users (m=72.6%). Conclusions: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, hence limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily life. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.",Marta Anna Marciniak et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-8DA-A42,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-8DA-A42,2020-08-31,2020-11-17T13:31:39+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; mobile app; cognitive behavioral therapy; cbt; ecological momentary intervention; mhealth; emi; covid-19,False
159,ANXIETY INCREASES THE WILLINGNESS TO BE EXPOSED TO COVID-19 RISK AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN FRANCE,"The COVID-19 outbreak has generated significant uncertainty about the future, especially for young adults. Health and economic threats, as well as more diffuse concerns about the consequences of COVID-19, can trigger feelings of anxiety, leading individuals to adopt uncertainty-reducing behaviours. We tested whether anxiety was associated with an increase in willingness to be exposed to the risk of COVID-19 infection (WiRE) using an online survey administered to 3,110 French individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old during the lockdown period (April 2020). Overall, 56.5% of the sample declared a positive WiRE. Unemployment was associated with a higher WiRE (+8.2 percentage points (pp); 95% CI +0.9-15.4 pp). One standard deviation increases in income (+1160€) and psychological state anxiety raised the WiRE by +2.7 pp (95% CI: +1.1-4.4 pp) and +3.9 pp (95% CI: +1.6-6.2 pp), respectively. A one standard deviation increase in perceived hospitalisation risk was associated with a -4.1 pp (95% CI: -6.2-2.1 pp) decrease in the WiRE. Overall, our results suggest that both the prospect of economic losses and psychological anxiety can undermine young adults’ adherence to physical distancing recommendations.

160,Validation to Spanish version of the COVID-19 Stress Scale,"There is a global consensus about the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to affect people's mental health. In this context, and prior to the formulation of mitigation strategies, tools are required that allow an objective and effective assessment of mental health risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of COVID-19 Stress Scale, formulated by Taylor et al. (2020), based on the concept of COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. A national sample of 1214 participating adults was taken in Colombia, who answered a translated version of the scale.

161,Appealing to economic (vs. health) risk may be more effective to fight COVID-19: A multilevel analysis in 24 countries,"This paper examines whether compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures is motivated by wanting to save lives or save the economy (or both), and which implications this carries to fight the pandemic. National representative samples were collected from 24 countries (N=25,435). The main predictors were (i) perceived risk to contract coronavirus, (ii) perceived risk to suffer economic losses due to coronavirus, and (iii) their interaction effect. Individual and country-level variables were added as covariates in multilevel regression models. We examined compliance with various preventive health behaviors and support for strict containment policies. Results show that perceived economic risk consistently predicted mitigation behavior and policy support - and its effects were positive. Perceived health risk had mixed effects. Only two significant interactions between health and economic risk were identified – both positive. These results do not corroborate the view that people engage in health versus economy zero-sum thinking in the fight against COVID-19.",Claudia F Nisa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A8-67D-126,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A8-67D-126,2020-07-01,2020-11-16T15:43:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology,False
162,Risk Attitudes and Human Mobility during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Behavioral responses to pandemics are less shaped by actual mortality or hospitalization risks than they are by risk attitudes. We explore human mobility patterns as a measure of behavioral responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that risk-taking attitude is a critical factor in predicting reduction in human mobility and increase social confinement around the globe. We find that the sharp decline in movement after the WHO (World Health Organization) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic can be attributed to risk attitudes. Our results suggest that regions with risk-averse attitudes are more likely to adjust their behavioral activity in response to the declaration of a pandemic even before most official government lockdowns. Further understanding of the basis of responses to epidemics, e.g., precautionary behavior, will help improve the containment of the spread of the virus.",Ho Fai Chan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46085-175-29B,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46085-175-29B,2020-06-15,2020-11-16T14:54:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; human mobility; risk preference; risk attitude,False
163,Factors influencing mental health among American youth in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objective: The article aims to show the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health of American youth. It also aims to identify factors that have an impact on the mental health maintenance of young Americans. The conducted analyses are an attempt at explaining the influence of high psycho-social stress on the mental health of young people. Methods: Secondary data from representative research conducted among the inhabitants of the United States of America on the sample of 10,139 respondents has been used in the analysis. Data is derived from the Pew Research Center, American Trends Panel. Results: The data analysis indicates that among all the age categories the highest levels of mental discomfort have been observed among the youngest Americans aged 18-29. The majority of respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The results of analyses of the youngest respondents (sample n=1083) have shown that there are a few factors which have impact on mental health of the young generation. Males, people living in relationships, practising religion more often, having a better financial situation, conservative beliefs and being devoid of citizenship had a better mental condition. Owned social, economic and cultural resources protect young Americans against the Covid-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The conducted research confirms the hypothesis that younger generations cope with the Covid-19 pandemic and related difficulties the worst. Due to the conducted analyses, the variables responsible for the deterioration of mental health in younger generations may be indicated.",Piotr Długosz,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-7A6-B6E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46182-7A6-B6E,2020-11-16,2020-11-16T11:06:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; youth; anxiety; depression.; the united states of america; mental health; keywords: covid-19,False
164,"Resilience of Adolescents, Though Weakened DuringPandemic-Related Quarantine, Serves as a Protective Process Against Depression and Sleep Problems","Adolescents facing adversities are susceptible to depression and sleep problems. Resilience is an important protective mechanism for coping with difficulties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents faced multiple hardships including being pulled from their schools and being unable to socialize with friends. Yet, it is unclear whether adolescents’ resiliency weakened during the global crisis or if the protective power of resilience is maintained under such circumstances. Here, in a partially longitudinal study, we demonstrate that Chinese adolescents’ resilience weakened during the pandemic-related quarantine compared to before the pandemic. However, resilience protected against depression and sleep problems for adolescents. A mediation model showed that higher resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, which in turn reduced sleep problems. Moreover, social support moderated this mediation. Our findings suggest that, though the resilience of adolescents weakened during the pandemic-related quarantine, it still serves as a protective process helping adolescents cope with adversities such as depression and sleep problems. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",Huangqi Jiang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-62D-4FE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-62D-4FE,2020-11-09,2020-11-16T10:39:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; depression; adolescents; sleep problems; quarantine; social support; resilience,False
165,Recognizing the Impact of Covid-19 on the Poor Alters Attitudes Towards Poverty and Inequality,"The novel Coronavirus that spread around the world in early 2020 triggered a global pandemic and economic downturn that affected nearly everyone. Yet the crisis had a disproportionate impact on the poor and revealed how easily working-class individuals’ financial security can be destabilised by factors beyond personal control. In a pre-registered longitudinal study of Americans (N = 233) spanning April 2019 to May 2020, we tested whether the pandemic altered beliefs about the extent to which poverty is caused by external forces and internal dispositions and support for economic inequality. Over this timespan, participants revealed a shift in their attributions for poverty, reporting that poverty is more strongly impacted by external-situational causes and less by internal-dispositional causes. However, we did not detect an overall mean-level change in opposition to inequality or support for government intervention. Instead, only for those who most strongly recognized the negative impact of COVID-19 did changes in poverty attributions translate to decreased support for inequality, and increased support for government intervention to help the poor.",Dylan Wiwad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604D-00D-71C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604D-00D-71C,2020-11-13,2020-11-15T04:09:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Attitudes and Persuasion; attributions for poverty; covid-19; inequality,False
166,Mental health considerations in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review,"Introduction: The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the mental health of populations across the world. However, the scope of this impact on children and adolescents has not yet been fully assessed. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted using the terms “COVID-19”, “nCoV-2”, “children”, “adolescents”, “anxiety”, “depression”, “attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder”, “ADHD”, “autism”, “autism spectrum disorder”, “mental health” and “psychiatry” in various permutations and combinations. A total of 23 articles of direct relevance were retrieved, including four observational studies. Results: Emotional disturbances were noted in substantial numbers of children. In younger children (aged 3-6 years), these were mainly non-specific, such as clinginess, fearfulness and irritability. In older children, symptoms of anxiety and depression were noted in 19-22%. Children with pre-existing disorders, such as ADHD, were at risk of symptom exacerbation. Other concerns flagged in the literature included an elevated risk of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, an increased risk of child abuse or neglect, and the need for special care in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The challenges of delivering mental health services in the context of social distancing measures were highlighted. Conclusion: Emotional and behavioural symptoms are a common reaction in children and adolescents, perhaps more so in children with additional risk factors. The management of these problems requires concerted cooperation between mental health professionals, families, and local authorities.",Ravi Philip Rajkumar,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-DF3-14C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-DF3-14C,2020-06-24,2020-11-15T04:02:47+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; anxiety; covid-19; adolescents; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder; depression; autism; children,False
167,Neurotic generation of Covid-19 in Eastern Europe,"The article presents the results of research on neuroticism among students in Poland and Ukraine, which has been contributed to by the coronavirus pandemic. The research was conducted on-line, on a sample of 1,978 respondents in Poland, and 411 in Ukraine. The results of this research indicate that average and high levels of neuroticism were observed among 61% of respondents in Poland, and 47% in Ukraine. The regression analysis has shown that the main factors which have an impact on the level of neuroticism are; educational burnout, gender, financial situation, interest in the pandemic and satisfaction with life. Neuroticism indicated by the respondents increases with educational burnout, loss of economic resources and an increase in the interest in the pandemic. Moreover, female respondents score higher on the scale of neuroticism. Comparative analyses between Polish and Ukrainian students indicate that Ukrainian youth cope with quarantine and distance education better, and have better mental health. The collected observations show that in the conditions of a pandemic, neuroticism among young generations may increase.",Piotr Długosz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600C-FAA-C3E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600C-FAA-C3E,2020-11-14,2020-11-15T03:12:00+00:00,PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; educational burnout; poland and ukraine; students; covid-19; neuroticism; stress,False
168,Place attachment and acceptance of smart city technologies,"Recent studies on smart cities have emphasised that smart solution initiatives should take into account citizens’ different needs and concerns. The main aim of this paper is to examine the role of different types of place attachment – emotional bonds that residents have with their city – in predicting the acceptance of future smart city technologies. In our study conducted among residents of multiple cities in Poland (N = 627), we found that while active place attachment (i.e. conscious identification with a place) predicted more favourable attitudes towards enabling technologies, traditional (natural and unintentional) place attachment was positively associated with acceptance of surveillance technologies regarding everyday monitoring and anti– Covid-19 measures. We also found that the relationship between place attachment and acceptance of future technologies is partially mediated by the use of existing smart city technologies.

169,The Role of Trust and Information in Protective Behaviors and Conspiracy Belief during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis, and the spread of the virus needs to be curbed. We hypothesized that trust in authorities is required for informed adherence to guidelines, meaning populism and conspiracy thinking are risk factors in the effort to curb the pandemic. Through a large survey in twelve countries worldwide (N = 7,755), we show that adherence to protective guidelines is driven by concern about COVID-19, perceived risk, female gender, feeling informed, and trust in scientists. Endorsement of conspiracy belief that the virus is artificially created was predicted by distrust in scientists, trust in populist governments, and distrust in non-populist governments. Conspiracy belief was associated with trust in Facebook and distrust in institutional websites (WHO, government and healthcare). This research shows that trust in authorities and access to trustworthy information is paramount to encourage adherence to safety guidelines and avoid conspiracy thinking during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Valerie Van Mulukom,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-C7E-7A4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46056-C7E-7A4,2020-08-01,2020-11-14T09:22:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; information; health behaviors; adherence; prevention guidelines; safety precautions; compliance; coronavirus; conspiracy beliefs; trust in government; trust in science; covid-19 guidelines; covid-19,False
170,Traumatic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an International Sample: Contribution of Fatalism to Psychological Distress and Behavior Change,"This study aimed to assess the traumatic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the contribution of fatalism to a) psychological distress and b) pandemic-related behavior change. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, pandemic-related stress, impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and fatalism. The sample included 465 participants from 30 countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 – 76; 80% female). While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe PTSS. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with lack of behavior changes in response to the pandemic. Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Fatalism may contribute to severity of psychological distress and diminish individuals’ ability to engage in health-protective behaviors.",Olga Bogolyubova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D,2020-08-18,2020-11-13T14:54:02+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; coronavirus; covid-19; traumatic stress; mental health; ptss; health behavior; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism,False
171,A longitudinal assessment of depression and anxiety in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic may have affected mental health in the general population. We examined if a higher proportion of people screened positive for depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) during the first week of nationwide quarantine than in February 2019; if each disorder increased over six weeks of quarantine; and what predicted screening positive for depression or GAD across this period. Two nationally representative samples of Irish adults were collected using identical methods in February 2019 (N = 1020) and April 2020 (N = 1041). The latter were followed for six weeks during nationwide quarantine. Respondents completed the same measures of depression and GAD. A significantly greater proportion of people screened positive for depression in 2019 (29.8% 95% CI = 27.0, 32.6) than 2020 (22.8% 95% CI = 20.2, 25.3). There were no significant changes in the proportion of people who screened positive for depression or GAD across six weeks of quarantine. Screening positive for depression or GAD during the pandemic was predicted by female sex, younger age, and multiple psychological variables.

172,Support for Open Science Practices in Emotion Science: A Survey Study,"So-called “open science practices” seek to improve research transparency and methodological rigor. What do emotion researchers think about these practices? To address this question, we surveyed active emotion researchers (N= 144) in October 2019 about their attitudes toward several open science practices. Overall, the majority of emotion researchers had positive attitudes toward open science practices and expressed a willingness to engage in such practices. Emotion researchers on average believed that replicability would improve by publishing more negative findings, by requiring open data and materials, and by conducting studies with larger sample sizes. Direct replications, multi-lab studies, and preregistration were all seen as beneficial to the replicability of emotion research. Emotion researchers believed that more direct replications would be conducted if replication studies would receive increased funding, more citations, and easier publication in high impact journals. Emotion researchers believed that preregistration would be stimulated by providing researchers with more information about its benefits and more guidance on its effective application. Overall, these findings point to considerable momentum with regard to open science among emotion researchers. This momentum may be leveraged to achieve a more robust emotion science.",Olmo Van Den Akker et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-C7C-DEE,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46100-C7C-DEE,2020-11-11,2020-11-11T17:17:53+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology,False
173,Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions,"The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their child’s schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.",Lisa B Thorell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-DEA-E25,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-DEA-E25,2020-09-24,2020-11-11T16:42:24+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; psychosocial effects; mental health problems; homeschooling; covid-19,False
174,Rational Curiosity and Information-Seeking in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Curiosity is a powerful determinant of behavior. The past decade has seen a surge of scientific research on curiosity, an endeavor recently imbibed with urgency by the WHO, which set managing information-seeking as a public health goal during pandemics. And yet, a fundamental aspect of curiosity has remained unresolved: its relationship to utility. Is curiosity a drive towards information simply for the sake of obtaining that information, or is it a rational drive towards optimal learning? We leveraged people’s curiosity about COVID-19 to study information-seeking and learning in a large sample (n=5376) during the spring of 2020. Our findings reveal that curiosity is goal-rational in that it maximizes the personal utility of learning. Personal utility, unlike normative economic utility, is contingent on a person’s motivational state. On the basis of these findings, we explain information-seeking during the pandemic with a rational theoretical framework for curiosity.",Yaniv Abir et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-C7B-33F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-C7B-33F,2020-11-11,2020-11-11T16:28:46+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Learning; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; information-seeking; covid-19; curiosity; rational,False
175,Digital readiness and its effects on higher education students’ socio-emotional perceptions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on higher education in 2020. Worldwide, universities developed and implemented online courses for distance learning within a relatively short amount of time. The current study investigated how ready students were for this exceptional situation and how their readiness for digital learning influenced their socio-emotional experiences. N = 1,826 students from across all institutional faculties of a German comprehensive university took part in the online survey immediately before the semester began. Results indicate that, on average, higher education students seem to be ready for digital learning. A k-means cluster analysis revealed two groups of students that significantly differed with respect to their readiness for digital learning (in terms of technological equipment, prior experiences with e-learning, and skills for digital learning). Finally, students’ socio-emotional experiences, that is, their perceived stress, their work-life-balance as well as social and emotional loneliness significantly differed due to their cluster membership. Hence, the study points to the need to support higher education students in successfully coping with the challenges of emergency remote studying.",Marion Händel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EA-BBA-DE2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EA-BBA-DE2,2020-07-22,2020-11-10T20:18:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learning Situation; covid-19 pandemic; socio-emotional experiences; readiness for digital learning; cluster analysis,False
176,Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review,"Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. Decision-makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs in times of quarantine and social distancing.",Christian Rauschenberg et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865,2020-06-29,2020-11-10T17:21:58+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; digital psychiatry; intervention; mental health promotion; mhealth; covid-19; prevention; telemedicine; ehealth,False
177,Associations of Household Structure and Presence of Children in the Household with Mental Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Abstract Purpose: The objectives of the current study were to: (1) assess the impact of household structure (i.e. living alone compared to living with children, a partner, or both) and presence of children on mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) determine whether these associations are moderated by income or sex. Results: A total of 2,524 adults aged 25-55 were included in the analytic sample. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between explanatory variables and mental distress, measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4. In adjusted models, each additional child under the age of 12 was associated a decrease in mental distress (β=-0.21, p=0.03). This finding was significant when adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, sex, race, education, household income, living with a partner, and currently having a job) and historical depressive symptoms (CESD-8). Having children between the ages of 13 and 18 and household structure were not significantly associated with mental distress. Conclusion: This study supports prior literature that demonstrates the positive association of childrearing with psychological well-being, and suggests that these benefits may be present even under stay-at-home orders in the COVID-19 pandemic.",Emily Smail et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-133-B20,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-133-B20,2020-11-09,2020-11-10T08:16:45+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; mental distress; parenting paradox; covid-19; family structure",False
178,Screen time as an index of family distress,"The increase in children's screen time over the last few decades has concerned parents, educators, and policymakers alike, due to its association with negative developmental outcomes. Interventions have focused on educating parents about the apparent dangers and coaching them on how to limit screen time. Such interventions are unlikely to be effective if screen time is driven less by parental preference than by parental necessity, supplementing insufficient adult caretaker availability. We show that during the COVID crisis, screen time increased dramatically as a direct result of sudden decrease in adult caretaker availability. This indicates that lower screen time rates prior to the pandemic were not (merely) a function of well-informed parenting but of well-resourced parenting. We discuss implications for policy, as well as for the ongoing scientific debate about whether screen time is actually problematic for development.",Joshua K.

We conducted a panel study (N = 206) before and during the COVID-19 lockdown focusing on self-reported engagement in 50 proenvironmental behaviors and the intention to choose environmentally friendly delivery of products purchased online. We found an ambivalent effect on proenvironmental behaviors and no statistically credible change in the general tendency of people to engage in proenvironmental behaviors. Exploratory Rasch analysis revealed that neither the behavioral costs of proenvironmental behaviors nor people’s attitude levels changed. Even though participants reported an increase in behavioral costs of online shopping, their tendency to choose green delivery of products has not changed.",Jan Urban et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-9A3-E04,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-9A3-E04,2020-11-09,2020-11-09T19:25:38+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Contingent Valuation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Experimental Economics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Sustainability Behavior; delivery of products; behavioral costs; covid-19; environmental attitude; proenvironmental behavior; the campbell paradigm,False
180,Perspectives of early childhood teachers in Ireland on the role of play during the pandemic,"School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted the education of 91% of students worldwide. As a critical process in supporting young children’s resilience, play is increasingly recognised as a valuable pedagogical strategy within a shifting educational landscape during the pandemic. This study reports on findings from a survey on play in early childhood education of 309 early childhood teachers during primary school closures in Ireland. Eighty-two per cent of teachers recommended play strategies to parents during remote teaching and home schooling and almost all teachers (99%) intended to use play as a pedagogical strategy upon school reopening. Teachers believed play was an especially important pedagogical tool in supporting young children’s social-emotional development, learning and transition back to school. Over a third highlighted uncertainty surrounding capacity to use play upon school reopening given COVID-19 regulations, emphasizing the need for greater guidance to support teachers’ commitment to play-based pedagogical strategies.",Christina O'Keeffe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46083-11C-347,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46083-11C-347,2020-08-06,2020-11-09T13:38:37+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; play; pandemic; early childhood education; covid-19; resilience; teachers' perspectives,False
181,Pandemic-Induced Depression and Anxiety in Healthcare Professionals,"Medical staff has been at the centre of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, facing diverse work-related stressors. Studies from various countries have shown that healthcare professionals have an increased risk of burnout and mental disorders during pandemic outbreaks. The present study aimed to investigate what kind of work-related stressors healthcare professionals in Germany have been facing and how they have been affected psychologically by the COVID-19 pandemic. N=300 healthcare professionals completed an online survey including the ISR symptom checklist to measure psychological well-being and questions on help-seeking behaviour. Findings were analyzed using t-tests, regression, and comparisons to large clinical and non-clinical samples assessed before and during the pandemic. Results show that healthcare professionals were most affected by protective measures at their workplace and changes in work procedures. Psychological symptoms, especially of anxiety and depression, were significantly more severe than in a non-clinical pre-pandemic sample and in the general population during the pandemic. At the same time, most professionals indicated that they would not seek help for psychological concerns. These findings indicate that healthcare employers need to pay increasing attention to the mental health of their staff, encourage help-seeking behaviour, as well as provide access to mental health support.",Stephan Weibelzahl et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-00F-FC8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-00F-FC8,2020-11-09,2020-11-09T11:31:21+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress,False
182,"Correlates of financial concerns, depression symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic: A face-to-face interview approach","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical, mental and financial health of many individuals. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals are specifically impacted amid this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate correlates of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (“slums”) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: A total of 435 individuals (male=54.7%; mean age=45.0±12.0 years; age range=18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Associated factors included female gender, primary education, jobless, food scarcity, and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, being jobless, being divorced, living in a joint family, excessive sleep, and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness, and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. Limitations: Potential limitations included cross-sectional study design and limited sample size. Conclusions: Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services, should be introduced to mitigate against psychological and financial effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.",Saiful Islam et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5,2020-11-08,2020-11-09T02:48:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,False
183,Change and stability in the influence of parents’ education on children’s intelligence,"We tested the relative influence of mothers’ and fathers’ education on children’s differences in intelligence (IQ) across five UK population cohort studies (total N = 48,175) with children born in 1946, 1958, 1970, 1994-96, and 2000. Associations between mothers’ and fathers’ education with children’s IQ ranged from r = .38 (CI 95% .36 - .41) to r = .19 (CI 95% .17-.20) across generations. Fathers’ education was more strongly associated with children’s IQ in earlier cohorts but later, mothers’ education became more influential. Negative interactions between mothers’ and fathers’ education, suggesting compensatory effects, influenced children’s IQ only in the earlier cohorts significantly. We conclude parents’ education has continuously influenced children’s IQ with medium to large effect sizes across generations.",Sophie Nicole Cave et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46049-D5E-1B3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46049-D5E-1B3,2020-11-06,2020-11-07T06:15:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; iq; cohort studies; education; intelligence; secondary data analysis; parents; early childhood,False
184,Self-persuasion increases motivation to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic through moral obligation,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments use direct persuasion to encourage social isolation. Since self-persuasion is a more effective method of encouraging behavioural changes, using an experimental approach, we compared direct persuasion to self-persuasion on underlying motivations for voluntary social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We asked the participants (N = 375) to write three arguments in support of social isolation (self-persuasion condition) or to evaluate three government graphics containing arguments for social isolation (direct persuasion condition). Then we asked the participants to evaluate perceived own vulnerability to COVID-19, the perceived severity of COVID-19, moral obligation to socially isolate and the attitude toward social isolation. Self-persuasion had a significant impact on the moral obligation to socially isolate, and through it on self-isolation intention. We also found evidence that individuals who perceived greater benefits from social isolation and who perceived higher severity of COVID-19 have a higher intention to socially isolate. Significant sex and age differences also emerged. Our findings provide new insights into mechanisms of self-persuasion and underlying motivations that influence social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Dariusz Drążkowski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-5D9-0DD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D3-5D9-0DD,2020-09-26,2020-11-06T20:45:08+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social isolation; pandemic; self-persuasion; covid-19; moral obligation; motivation,False
185,"Predictors and impact of arts engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic: analyses of data from 19,384 adults in the COVID-19 Social Study","Objectives. The global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 heavily affected the arts and creative industries due to the instigation of lockdown measures in the UK and closure of venues. However, it also provided new opportunities for arts and cultural engagement through virtual activities and streamed performances. Yet it remains unclear (i) who was likely to engage with the arts at home during lockdown, (ii) how this engagement differed from patterns of arts engagement prior to COVID-19, and (iii) whether home-based arts engagement was related to people’s ability to cope with their emotions during lockdown. This study was therefore designed to address these questions. Methods. We used data collected in late May from the UK COVID-19 Social Study run by University College London. Multivariate regressions were used for the analysis (N=19,384). Identified confounders included demographic factors, socio-economic position, psychosocial wellbeing and health conditions, adverse events/worries, and coping styles. Results. Four types of home-based arts engagement were identified during the COVID-19 pandemic: digital arts & writing, performing arts, crafts, and reading for pleasure. Our results show that the strongest predictors of the engagement were age, education levels, social support, social network size, and trait emotion-focused or supportive coping styles. In particular, younger adults (aged 18-29), non-keyworkers, people with greater social support, and those with a trait emotion-focused coping style were more likely to have increased arts engagement during lockdown. Arts activities were used as approach and avoidance strategies to help cope with emotions, as well as to help improve self-development. Conclusions. Overall, our study suggests that some people who engaged in the arts during the COVID-19 pandemic were those who typically engage under normal circumstances. However, there were also some heterogeneity across social, cultural and economic groups when comparing normal circumstances and the pandemic. Additionally, this study highlights the value of the arts as coping tools during stressful situations.",Hei Wan Mak et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-638-A15,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-638-A15,2020-11-04,2020-11-05T21:18:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; demographics; covid-19; arts engagement; socio-economic position; psychosocial wellbeing; coping styles,False
186,Young adults view smartphone tracking technologies for COVID-19 as acceptable: the case of Taiwan,"Taiwan has been successful in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, without a vaccine the threat of a second outbreak remains. Young adults who show few-to-no symptoms when infected have been identified in many countries as driving the virus' spread through unidentifiable community transmission. Mobile tracking technologies register nearby contacts of a user and notifies them if one later tests positive to the virus, potentially solving this issue; however, the effectiveness of these technologies depends on their acceptance by the public. The current study assessed attitudes towards three tracking technologies (telecommunication network tracking, a government app, and Apple and Google's Bluetooth exposure notification system) among four samples of young Taiwanese adults (aged 25 years or younger). Using Bayesian methods, we find high acceptance for all three tracking technologies (> 75%), with acceptance for each technology surpassing 90% if additional privacy measures were included.

187,"How To Kill A Greek God - A Review, Critique, and Meta-Analysis of 14 years of Proteus Effect Research","The Proteus Effect is a phenomenon whereby a user of a virtual environment temporarily adopts attitudes and behaviours that are consistent with stereotypes associated with the appearance of their avatar. A recent meta-analysis (Ratan et al, 2019) estimates that the strength of the Proteus Effect is ""small to medium"" under the de facto descriptors of Cohen (1992). Ratan et al also suggest some meta-analytic regressors which may moderate the overall effect. In this replication and extension of Ratan et al’s review, the conditions under which an effect should be observed are made explicit, and a number of potential issues with the previous review are highlighted and addressed. These include conflation of a number of different theories (Virtual Self Modelling, perspective taking), the erroneous inclusion and omission of studies, errors in effect size calculation, and the possible motivated selection of effects. Results reveal that although the Proteus Effect may be a robust effect with several demonstrative studies, the omnibus effect size of the Proteus Effect is smaller than previously indicated, is sensitive to the inclusion of negative results, and that the moderators suggested in the original meta-analysis do not significantly contribute to the prediction of the effect sizes. It is ultimately argued that the Proteus Effect ought not be embraced as an intervention and is more useful as an indicator of stereotype activations. Suggestions are made for a progressive research line which aims to unpack the Proteus Effect and increase the consistency and variety of predictions it can make, including ways to reduce the effect and allow controllers the freedom to be who they want to be in virtual environments.",Oliver James Clark,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46162-DBE-349,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46162-DBE-349,2020-10-28,2020-11-05T12:41:57+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; avatars; proteus effect; attitudes; behaviours",False
188,Brief online-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy for dysfunctional worry related to the covid-19 pandemic: A randomised trial,"Introduction: Worries about the immediate and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may for some individuals develop into pervasive worry that is disproportionate in its intensity or duration and significantly interferes with everyday life. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate if a brief self-guided, online psychological intervention can reduce the degree of dysfunctional worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated symptoms. Methods: 670 adults from the general Swedish general population reporting daily uncontrollable worry about COVID-19 and its possible consequences (e.g. illness, death, the economy, one’s family) were randomised (1:1 ratio) to a 3-week self-guided, online cognitive behavioural intervention targeting dysfunctional COVID-19 worry and associated symptoms, or a waiting list of equal duration. The primary outcome measure was a COVID-19 adapted version of the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale assessed at baseline and weeks 1-3 (primary endpoint). Follow-up assessments were conducted one month after treatment completion. The trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04341922) before inclusion of the first participant. Results: The main pre-specified intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant reductions in COVID-19-related worry for the intervention group compared to waiting list (=1.14, Z=9.27, p<.001), corresponding to a medium effect size (bootstrapped d=0.74 [95% CI; 0.58 to 0.90]). Improvements were also seen on all secondary measures, including mood, daily functioning, insomnia and intolerance of uncertainty. Participant satisfaction was high.

189,Self-compassion buffers the adverse mental health impacts of COVID-19-related threats: Results from a cross-sectional survey at the first peak of Hong Kong’s outbreak,"COVID-19 has brought tremendous and abrupt threats to various aspects of our daily lives, from school and work to interpersonal relationships. Self-compassion is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people’s resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.",Bobo Hi Po Lau et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829,2020-07-23,2020-11-05T05:42:03+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; hong kong; depression; anxiety; covid-19; mental health; self-coldness; self-compassion,False
190,Concerns about the Coronavirus Outbreak among Health and Social Service Workers: The Mediating Role of Job Burnout,"Background: The current worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has elicited widespread concerns and stress. The current research examined the links between tendency to worry, concerns related to COVID-19 and psychological distress (anxiety, depression, stress). We were specifically interested in the mediating role of job burnout. Methods: Ninety-eight health and social service workers participated in the study (including medical and paramedical staff members, therapists and more). Participants completed an online survey that included questionnaires related to COVID-19 concerns, tendency to worry (PSWQ), psychological distress (DASS) and job burnout (SMBM). Results: Significant correlations emerged between COVID-19-related concerns, tendency to worry and psychological distress. Our findings showed that individuals working in health and social services fields who reported a higher tendency to worry experienced more psychological distress and that job burnout mediated this link. Furthermore, the link between worry and concerns related to COVID-19 was mediated by psychological distress. Limitations: In comparison with other countries such as Italy, and China; the cases in Israel haven't exceeded the coping competencies of the health and social service staffs. Conclusions: These findings highlight the role of worry and job burnout in psychological distress among individuals who work in health and social services fields.

191,Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants (N =14,393; Observations =48,486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June, 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score ≥3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April, 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%), 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April, 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI [14.3%-22.9%]), followed by females and high income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June, 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation.

In this study, a large-scale online survey was conducted in Japan to explore the determinants of infection preventive behaviors. In addition, this survey collected data on various attitudes and behaviors in this pandemic situation, including optimistic/pessimistic views and information dissemination behavior on social networking sites (SNS). The results showed that the infection risk perception of self and others were both associated with the preventive behaviors, but the social pressure was not. The results were unclear in regard to optimistic/pessimistic views for infection risk perception and prospect for the end of coronavirus outbreak. Surprisingly, information spreading via SNS was negatively associated with knowledge of COVID-19, which calls attention to the credibility of information on SNS. In addition, subjective evaluation of achievement in regard to preventive behaviors was higher for self than for other people. This suggests that a self-enhancement tendency may contribute to the evaluation of preventive behaviors. Despite limitations such as employing a cross-sectional survey design and using data collected only in Japan, our study provides useful insights into the determinants of infection preventive behaviors, information dissemination, and the self-enhancement tendency in the evaluation of preventive behaviors.

193,Identifying frail populations for disease risk prediction and intervention planning in the Covid-19 era: a focus on social isolation and psychosocial vulnerability,"Background: The early identification of fragile populations in the Covid-19 era would help governments to allocate resources and plan strategies to contain consequences of the pandemic. Beyond frailty, social vulnerability to environmental stressors, such as the social distancing enforced to reduce the SARS-CoV2 contagion, can modify long-term disease risk and induce health status changes in the general population. Methods: We assessed frailty and social vulnerability indices in 1258 Italian residents during the lockdown phase (March 14-31, 2020) via an on-line survey. We compared indices taking into account age categories (young, middle, older adults and elders) and gender. Results: While frailty showed a linear increase with age and was greater in females than in males, social vulnerability was higher in young adults and elders compared to middle aged and older adults, and in males than females. Both frailty and social vulnerability contributed in explaining the individual perception of the impact of Covid-19 emergency on health, which was further modulated by proactive attitudes/behaviors and social isolation. Conclusions: Social isolation and loneliness following the Covid-19 outbreak may exert dramatic psychosocial effects in the general population. The early detection of vulnerable categories, at risk to become ill and develop long-lasting health status changes, would help in the next future to prevent consequences on general well-being by allocating resources to targeted interventions managing psychosocial distress and increasing young adults and elderly resilience towards the post-Covid-19 crisis.",Chiara Cerami et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-1E1-A4E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-1E1-A4E,2020-07-24,2020-11-03T15:19:09+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology",False
194,"Parenting Adolescents in Times of a Pandemic: Changes in Relationship Quality, Autonomy Support, and Parental Control?","This multi-informant study examined effects of COVID-19 on parent-adolescent relationships in the spring of 2020. Four bi-weekly measurements before and four bi-weekly measurements during the lockdown were collected among Dutch adolescents (N = 179, Mage = 14.26 years, 69% girls) and their parents (N = 144, Mage = 47.01 years, 81% female; educational level 12% low, 33% medium, 55% high). Adolescents and parents reported on parental support, parent-adolescent conflict, autonomy support, psychological control, and behavioral control. Additionally, they reported how their daily routines had changed during the lockdown. Parents and adolescents spent more time together during lockdown (before M = 8.6h, during M = 12.7h) but less time with friends (before M = 8.1h, during M = 2.1h), and reported on average 13 corona-related rules. Pre-registered piece-wise growth models confirmed that autonomy support decreased immediately after the lockdown, but no mean-level changes were observed in the other relationship dimensions. During the first two months of the lockdown, parents reported gradual increases in autonomy support and decreases in behavioral control. Moreover, significant differences between families were found in sudden and more gradual relationship changes, which correlated strongly with pre-lockdown characteristics of the relationship, and in some models with adolescent oppositional defiance and legitimacy beliefs. In sum, findings suggest resilience in most families, but also heterogeneity. Some families were negatively affected (e.g., more conflicts and psychological control) and others were positively affected (e.g., more warmth, less conflicts).

195,Facial Expressions of Emotion Categories are Embedded within a Dimensional Space of Valence-arousal,"One of the longest standing debates in the emotion sciences is whether emotions are represented as discrete categories such as happy or sad or as continuous fundamental dimensions such as valence and arousal. Theories of communication make specific predictions about the facial expression signals that would represent emotions as either discrete or dimensional messages. Here, we address this debate by testing whether facial expressions of emotion categories are embedded in a dimensional space of affective signals, leading to multiplexed communication of affective information. Using a data-driven method based on human perception, we modelled the facial expressions representing the six classic emotion categories – happy, surprise, fear, disgust, anger and sad – and those representing the dimensions of valence and arousal. We then evaluated their embedding by mapping and validating the facial expressions categories onto the valence-arousal space. Results showed that facial expressions of these six classic emotion categories formed dissociable clusters within the valence-arousal space, each located in semantically congruent regions (e.g., happy facial expressions distributed in positively valenced regions). Crucially, we further demonstrated the generalization of the embedding beyond the six classic categories, using a broader set of 19 complex emotion categories (e.g., delighted, fury, and terrified). Together, our results show that facial expressions of emotion categories comprise specific combinations of valence and arousal related face movements, suggesting a multiplexed signalling of categorical and dimensional affective information. Our results unite current theories of emotion representation to form the basis of a new framework of multiplexed communication of affective information.",Meng Liu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615E-7E0-048,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615E-7E0-048,2020-11-03,2020-11-03T14:54:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; reverse-correlation; affect; facial expressions; dimensional; categorical,False
196,Dynamic patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep during the first month of strict lockdown in two women with major depressive disorder,"This article aimed to document the day-to-day patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep parameters, and to explore the dynamic network structure of depressive symptoms during the first COVID strict lockdown. Two participants with major depressive disorders were included in an 30-day observational ecological momentary assessment study just before the lockdown in Montreal, Canada. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lowckdown. However, all depressive symptoms were not systematically exacerbated. Among them, significant linear and no-linear temporal patterns have been identified. For case-1, the poor sleep quality and deteriorated sleep parameters were not worsen during the lockdown. The psychomotor retardation and level of arousal played a prominent role in the idiographic dynamic symptom networks. These case studies allow a granular understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences dynamics, and highlight the need of person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder.",Paquito Bernard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,2020-07-14,2020-11-03T12:34:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; sleep; idiographic; depressive symptoms; covid-19; insomnia,False
197,High Work-related Stress and Anxiety Response to COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in South Korea: SAVE study,"Background: We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. Methods: Participants for this study comprised 1,783 healthcare workers drawn from two hospitals inKorea. We adopted a cross-sectional online survey design and used an anonymous questionnaire from 20-30 April 2020, with information on demographics, psychiatric history, Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared to other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression, general anxiety, and virus-related anxiety symptoms (p < 0.01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥ 10) than married workers (20.3% vs 14.1%; p < 0.01), and junior (< 40 years old) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis adjusted with age, sex, and work duration identified three factors as significantly associated with healthcare worker's depression (PHQ-9 ≥ 10): being a nursing professional (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 – 1.98), single (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.83), and higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15 – 1.22). Conclusions: Psychological support and interventions for healthcare workers, especially nursing professionals, single, and high SAVE-9 level should be considered.",Myung Hee Ahn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46235-117-0B7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46235-117-0B7,2020-07-18,2020-11-03T12:20:20+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other",False
198,Values and well-being change amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland,"COVID-19 caused a global change in the circumstances and lifestyles of most people. We examined whether COVID-19 pandemic influenced what people consider important in life (values), as well as several aspects of their well-being. This extraordinary event has provided an unprecedented opportunity to observe the extent to which values and well-being are influenced by adverse external factors. Participants (N = 150) reported their values and subjective and eduaimonic well-being nine months before lockdown in Poland, two weeks and four weeks into lockdown. We observed a significant decrease in well-being and significant changes in values: there was an increase in the importance of self-direction, achievement, security and conformity, humility, benevolence and universalism, and a decrease in hedonism. These data are consistent with reports on well-being decrease during the COVID-19 coming from around the world and with data on the changes in values reported during earlier national and global crises.",Agnieszka Bojanowska et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-B23-4B7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-B23-4B7,2020-07-23,2020-11-03T08:37:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being,False
199,Unrealistic optimism and HEXACO traits as predictors of risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures during the first wave of pandemic,"The aims of this study were to examine possible differences and factors that contribute to risk perception and compliance with preventive measures at the beginning (T1) and the end (T2) of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 423 participants (M = 30.29, SD = 14.45; 69% female). Compliance, risk perception and trust in information were significantly higher in T1 than T2. For risk perception, significant predictors in both T1 and T2 were age, Emotionality (HEXACO-PI-R), and Unrealistic Optimism (NLE, Negative Life Events). Trust in information was a significant predictor in T1, while Unrealistic Optimism (Positive Life Events) was a significant predictor in T2. For compliance, significant predictors in T1 were gender and trust in information while in T2 were Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness (HEXACO-PI-R), NLE and trust in information, for both T1 and T2. In general, findings suggest a much more pronounced role of personality traits in adherence to protective measures at the end than at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia. Also, the results indicate the role of unrealistic optimism regarding negative life events in lower compliance with protective measures.",Milan Oljača et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-3FE-FDD,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-3FE-FDD,2020-11-02,2020-11-02T17:37:05+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; hexaco; covid-19; risk perception; unrealistic optimism; compliance to protective measures,False
200,Personality Psychology in Times of Crisis: Profile-specific Recommendations on how to deal with COVID-19,"The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic posed a twofold global health threat: Besides the evident danger to human life, the corona crisis is also a psychological crisis. Psychologists worldwide have contributed to cushion the distress that is laid on many societies and enforce adaptive coping strategies. However, psychological support in the past has often been broadly applied, has not been particularly parsimonious and has often been focused on severe psychological stressors. In this brief report we describe the development and application of a low-threshold tool that generates personality-specific recommendations on how to functionally cope with the psychological challenges of the corona crisis. The tool gained widespread attention in Germany and many other countries and was well received by users. It demonstrates how psychological knowledge from personality and health psychology can be combined to be of very concrete use for many people in a threatening situation.",Moritz Michels et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-65E-926,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-65E-926,2020-07-22,2020-11-02T16:06:32+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; psychological support; ipip; personality-targeted interventions; covid-19; corona,False
201,The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objectives This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. Design An online survey was designed including questions about psychological wellbeing, lockdown behaviours, and perceived COVID-19 threat, risk, and knowledge. Methods Individuals (N=8,229; 39.4% male, 59.4% female, 1.1% other, Mage=38.3, SD=13.5, range = 18-88) were recruited in 79 countries via the snowballing method and social media, and completed the survey in March-April 2020. Results Participant showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression during early stages of lockdown, predicted by perceived threat. Feelings of social isolation moderated the effect of threat on depression symptoms, and increased with the duration of quarantine, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Sense of control was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. Conclusions We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic – following perceived threat and lockdown measures – can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,2020-07-22,2020-11-02T16:02:17+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; coronavirus; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; social isolation; depression; mental health,False
202,Psychological distress and adaptation to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States,"Objective There is growing concern that the COVID-19 crisis may have long-standing mental health effects across society particularly amongst those with pre-existing mental health conditions. In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. Methods We analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from eight waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and July 20th, 2020 (N = 7319 Observations = 46145). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Results On average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p<.001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US. Distress levels subsequently declined to mid-March levels by June, 2020 (d =-.31, 95% CI [-0.34,-0.27], p<.001). Across the sociodemographic groups examined and those with pre-existing mental health conditions we observed a sharp rise in distress followed by a recovery to baseline distress levels. Conclusions This study identified substantial increases in distress in the US during the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis that largely diminished in the weeks that followed and suggests that population level resilience in mental health may be occurring in response to the pandemic.",Michael Daly et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717,2020-07-21,2020-11-02T15:55:55+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; covid-19; psychological distress; resilience; mental health; adaptation; longitudinal research,False
203,Mental health risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic in the Polish population,"Background: The level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed. Risk factors for mental health in the Polish population have been identified. Methods: The 926 respondents completed a set of questionnaires consisting of questions concerning COVID-19, PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R) and their mental health status (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21). Results: Most respondents reported severe PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (44.06%), normal intensity of depressive symptoms (52.38%), anxiety symptoms (56.05%) and stress (56.48%). Female gender, parental status, having a relationship, at least a two-person household are associated with higher PTSS and DASS-21 subscale. A few physical symptoms, a medical visit, quarantine, negative health evaluation, and chronic diseases, knowledge of the increase in the number of infected people and the number of deaths are associated with higher levels of PTSS. Some of the precautions and the need for additional information on COVID-10, the certainty of a high probability of contracting COVID-19, a low survival rate and concerns about loved ones are associated with higher PTSS.

204,"Psychological factors in Hungarian families under the coronavirus pandemic. The effects of resilience and stress on the wellbeing of adolescents, their interconnections within the family","Introduction: The period of coronavirus pandemic caused psychological stress for the families. An important factor in coping with such stress is resilience that can be described as a successful adaption to circumstances. Aims: The current study aims to investigate stress, resilience, and their interactions within Hungarian families. Methods: 346 parent-child dyad participated in the research by filling out online surveys that included demographic sheet and validated scales (CD-Risk, WHO, PSS). Results: The explanatory model for the children’s well-being is constructed to explain the connections among these psychological factors. Higher stress level predicts lower wellbeing both among parents and their children. The higher resilience of the child predicts higher wellbeing. However, parental resilience shows a weak negative correlation with the wellbeing of the child. Discussion: In accord with other studies the level of perceived stress was high. A surprising result of our research is that the parent’s resilience directly reduces their child’s well-being. However, a higher level of parental wellbeing (that is affected by their resilience) altogether leads to a higher level of well-being among the children too. These results can be useful for the professionals as the expected second wave of the pandemic will be surely burdened by psychological challenges.",Gabor Csikos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-B08-9C4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605E-B08-9C4,2020-07-18,2020-11-02T15:42:13+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; model; adolescent; pandemic; stress; percieved stress; coronavirus; resilience; anxiety; covid-19; well-being; children; family,False
205,Development and validation of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS),"During respiratory viral epidemics and pandemics such as the COVD-19 pandemic, everyday behaviors such as leaving the house and touching frequently-used surfaces become the subject of fear and avoidance due to their potential for contagion. Despite the potential mental health related impact of this psychological phenomenon, there are currently no measures available that are designed to evaluate the extent to which individuals become fearful of these everyday situations during a respiratory viral pandemic. Here, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS) questionnaire across two samples recruited online (ns = 243, 341) recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the ARVIS is best described by a single factor and shows a high reliability (Chronbach’s alpha > .88). It showed convergent associations with state anxiety and low discriminant associations with general trait anxiety and depression. Moreover, the ARVIS was highly associated with the extent to which subjects reported engaging in handwashing and social distancing, demonstrating criterion validity. This new scale provides a validated measure for assessing virus-related fear that can facilitate research into the psychological effects of respiratory virus pandemics.",Toby Wise et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0,2020-07-17,2020-11-02T15:37:48+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; pandemic; covid; anxiety; avoidance; infection; fear,False
206,On the Nature of the Change in the Wave Function in a Measurement in Quantum Mechanics,"Generally a central role has been assigned to an unavoidable physical interaction between the measuring instrument and the physical entity measured in the change in the wave function that often occurs in measurement in quantum mechanics. A survey of textbooks on quantum mechanics by authors such as Dicke and Witke (1960), Eisberg and Resnick (1985), Gasiorowicz (1974), Goswami (1992), and Liboff (1993) supports this point. Furthermore, in line with the view of Bohr and Feynman, generally the unavoidable interaction between a measuring instrument and the physical entity measured is considered responsible for the uncertainty principle. A gedankenexperiment using Feynman's double-hole interference scenario shows that physical interaction is not necessary to effect the change in the wave function that occurs in measurement in quantum mechanics. Instead, the general case is that knowledge is linked to the change in the wave function, not a physical interaction between the physical existent measured and the measuring instrument. Empirical work on electron shelving that involves null measurements, or what Renninger called negative observations (Zeitschrift fur Physik, vol. 158, p. 417), supports these points. Work on electron shelving is reported by Dehmelt and his colleagues (Physical Review Letters, vol. 56, p. 2797), Wineland and his colleagues (Physical Review Letters, vol. 57, p. 1699), and Sauter, Neuhauser, Blatt, and Toschek (Physical Review Letters, vol. 57, p. 1696).

207,Prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asia during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted biopsychosocial health and wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies suggest a high prevalence of common mental disorders, including anxiety and depression in South Asian countries, which may aggravate during this pandemic. This systematic meta-analytic review was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression in South Asian countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: We systematically searched for cross-sectional studies on eight major bibliographic databases and additional sources up to October 12, 2020, that reported the prevalence of anxiety or depression in any of the eight South Asian countries. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled proportion of anxiety and depression. Results: A total of 35 studies representing 41,402 participants were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety in 31 studies with a pooled sample of 28,877 was 41.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.7-48.1, I2 = 99.18%). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of depression was 34.1% (95% CI: 28.9-39.4, I2 = 99%) among 37,437 participants in 28 studies. Among the South Asian countries, India had a higher number of studies, whereas Bangladesh and Pakistan had a higher pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression. No studies were identified from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives. Studies in this review had high heterogeneity and varying prevalence across sub-groups. Conclusion: South Asian countries have high prevalence rates of anxiety and depression, suggesting a heavy psychosocial burden during this pandemic. Clinical and public mental health interventions should be prioritized alongside improving the social determinants of mental health in these countries. Lastly, a low number of studies with high heterogeneity requires further research exploring the psychosocial epidemiology during COVID-19, which may inform better mental health policymaking and practice in South Asia.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-A84-FE2,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-A84-FE2,2020-10-31,2020-11-02T14:46:29+00:00,PsyArXiv|Meta-science; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; sri lanka; pakistan; afghanistan; syndemic; anxiety; depression; nepal; india; epidemiology; psychiatry; bangladesh; pandemic; coronavirus; mental health; bhutan; covid-19; maldives; south asia,False
208,"Three pillars of physical distancing: Anxiety, prosociality, and rule compliance during the COVID-19-pandemic","The outbreak of a global pandemic such as COVID-19 poses a challenge for societies across the world. Lacking both vaccination and medical treatment, the only way to combat the spread of a virus in its early stages are behavioral measures, particularly physical distancing behavior. The present work proposes three pillars of individuals’ engagement in physical distancing: anxiety, prosociality, and rule compliance. In a large (N = 1,504), pre-registered study among German adults, we studied both situation-specific tendencies and stable personality traits that are theoretically associated with these pillars in relation to self-reported physical distancing behavior and underlying motives. Results supported the importance of each of the proposed pillars for physical distancing behavior. That is, for each pillar, we found (some) relations of the corresponding tendencies and personality traits with physical distancing (motives) as expected. Overall, the project provides a comprehensive picture of physical distancing behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Mathias Twardawski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-00B-8F1,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-00B-8F1,2020-07-16,2020-11-02T14:46:27+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Personality and Situations; physical distancing behavior; hexaco; personality; motives; covid-19,False

210,Perceived threat and acute anxiety predict increased everyday altruism during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Threatening situations have been shown to influence prosocial and altruistic behaviour in laboratory studies. However, it is unknown whether those effects would transfer to a real-life crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we examined the impact of changing COVID-19 threat on everyday altruism. Specifically, we investigated the association between defensive emotions associated with varying levels of perceived threat imminence, and reported frequency of altruistic behaviours. A sample of 600 United States residents was recruited online via Prolific at 4 different timepoints in March and April (n=150 each week). We collected self-report measures of everyday altruism, Perceived COVID-19 threat, and defensive emotions associated with varying threat imminence (anticipatory versus acute anxiety). Linear mixed effects models were used to predict variation in everyday altruism as a function of perceived COVID-19 threat and defensive emotions. Our results revealed a clear and consistent association between acute anxiety in response to the pandemic, and frequency of altruistic behaviours. No significant association was found between altruism and less acute defensive responses. These results suggest acute defensive emotions associated with higher threat imminence may promote altruistic action during a real-life crisis.",Joana Vieira et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46226-5B0-718,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46226-5B0-718,2020-07-24,2020-11-02T07:01:57+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; threat; emotion; prosocial; altruism; defensive; covid-19,False
211,Changes in Community Clinicians’ Attitudes and Competence following a Transdiagnostic Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Training,"Objective: Although data suggest that knowledge of evidence-based practices (EBPs) and attitudes towards EBPs may be related, the relation between attitudes and competence in delivering EBPs has not been examined. This study examined how initial attitudes and competence relate to improvements in attitudes and competence following EBP training. Methods: Community clinicians (N=891) received intensive training in cognitive behavioral therapy skills followed by six months of consultation. Clinician attitudes were assessed using the Evidence Based Practice Attitude Scale, and competence was assessed using the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale. Data was analyzed by fitting three latent change score models to examine the relationship between changes in attitudes and competence across the training and within its two phases (workshop phase, consultation phase). Results: Latent change models identified significant improvement in attitudes (Mslatent change≥1.07, SEs≤ 0.19, zs≥6.85, ps< .001) and competence (Mslatent change≥13.13, SEs≤3.53, zs≥2.30, ps<.001) across the full training and in each phase. Higher pre-workshop attitudes predicted significantly greater change in competence in the workshop phase and across the full training (bs≥1.58, SEs≤1.13, z≥1.89, p<.048, β≥0.09); however, contrary to our hypothesis, post-workshop attitudes did not significantly predict change in competence in the consultation phase (b=1.40, SE=1.07, z=1.31, p=.19, β=0.08).

212,Anxiety Talking: Does Anxiety Predict Sharing Information about COVID-19?,"Could fear and anxiety play a functional role during the COVID-19 pandemic by driving greater information sharing about the viral threat? To explore whether anxiety may serve as a unique emotional indicator of sharing information in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we used a representative sample of the United States from the American Trends Panel (N=9,188) conducted April 20th-26th, 2020. Participants reported how they have felt in the past week, where they got their news about the outbreak from, and whether they had posted COVID-19 news on social media or discussed the pandemic with others. Even after controlling for other emotions, news sources, and a range of demographic measures, feeling anxious—more so that other negative emotions, such as feeling depressed—predicted greater information sharing on social media (𝛽 = .05, p < .001) and beyond (𝛽 = .14, p < .001). These findings are consistent with functionalist theories of emotion, which predict that fear and anxiety play a unique role in both identifying and communicating threats to oneself and to others.",Ori Cantwell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-929-0DF,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-929-0DF,2020-10-31,2020-11-02T05:08:14+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Evolution|Survival and Psychological Adaptations; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; computer-mediated communication; cyberpsychology; donald trump; misinformation; information; health; anxiety; covid19; communication; depression; social media; media; cmc; emotion; mass media; health psychology; information sharing; social psychology; pandemic; coronavirus; covid-19; health behavior; mental health; trump; technology",False
213,"Spontaneous self-affirmation before and during COVID-19: Associations with information-seeking, worry and adherence","Objective: To assess the extent of spontaneous self-affirmation pre COVID-19 and during COVID-19 pandemic to identify for whom self-affirmation interventions might be helpful; and the extent to which spontaneous self-affirmation is associated with increased information-seeking, worry and adherence to UK government instructions. Methods: Two large nationally-representative surveys of UK adults were conducted via YouGov in March 2019 (pre COVID-19; N = 10421) and April 2020 (during COVID-19; N = 2252); both surveys measured demographic characteristics and spontaneous self-affirmation. The latter survey included measures of time spent accessing COVID-19 related news, worry about COVID-19 related news and degree of adherence to UK government instructions. Results: Spontaneous self-affirmation was lower before COVID-19 (44%) than it was during the pandemic (57%), although the pattern was in the opposite direction among older adults. Older adults were more likely to spontaneously self-affirm during COVID-19 than pre COVID-19. Greater spontaneous self-affirmation was associated with more time spent accessing news, and greater adherence to UK government instructions, but not media-related worry. Conclusions: The threat of COVID-19 may have triggered greater levels of spontaneous self-affirmation, which could give people the resources they needed to allow them to seek COVID-19-related news and adhere to UK government instructions. Groups lower in spontaneous self-affirmation, such as younger people could be targeted with brief interventions to promote self-affirmation and encourage performance of adaptive behaviors.",Tracy Epton et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618A-AFC-8F4,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618A-AFC-8F4,2020-10-30,2020-11-02T02:54:31+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; covid-19; self-affirmation,False
214,"Sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in Italian school-age children and their mothers during COVID-19 lockdown","Background. By March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown to limit viral transmission of COVID-19 infection, which establishes home confinement, movement restriction, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools of every order and degree. The current study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in school-age children and their mothers during the lockdown. Methods. Using an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits (timing, quality, quantity), time experience, and psychological difficulties (emotional and behavioral) and of those of their children (6-10 yrs old) during the home confinement and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. Results. During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing, i.e., later bedtime and wake time, and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect the daily routines and to keep track of the passage of time. We also observe increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers’ psychological difficulties. Also, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, which degree varied depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their home during the lockdown reported a more regular sleep pattern, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their time perception. Conclusions. Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures are needed to be in place to mitigate their long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those in the smart working condition.",Nicola Cellini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-046-916,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-046-916,2020-07-17,2020-10-31T23:08:45+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior,False
215,Subjective wellbeing in parents during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia,"Objectives: To examine the subjective wellbeing of Australian parents raising children and adolescents (0-18 years) during ‘stage three’ COVID-19 restrictions (April 2020), in comparison with subjective wellbeing in parents assessed over an 18-year period prior to the pandemic. We also aimed to examine socio-demographic and COVID-19 predictors of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional data were from: (1) the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS, N=2,365 parents of a child 0-18 years, 8-28th April, 2020); and, (2) a pre-pandemic database bringing together over 18-years of national data on subjective wellbeing (N=17,529 adults living with children, collected in annual surveys over 2002-2019). Results: Levels of subjective wellbeing during the pandemic were considerably lower than ratings prior to the pandemic (Personal Wellbeing Index, mean [SD]=65.3 [17.0]; compared to [SD]=75.8 [11.9], p<0.001). Within the pandemic data, subjective wellbeing was lower in parents with low education, language other-than-English, receiving income assistance (i.e., a government benefit), single parents, and young parents. Subjective wellbeing was also lower in fathers, parents raising a child with a neurodevelopmental condition, parents with physical or mental health problems, and parents reporting COVID-related stressors, such as employment changes, financial strain, negative feelings/attributions about COVID-19, and supervising children while working-from-home. Unexpectedly, parent engagement with news media about the pandemic was associated with higher subjective wellbeing. Conclusion: Subjective wellbeing in parents raising children aged 0-18 years appears to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social restrictions in Australia. Specific at-risk groups, for which government intervention may be warranted, include parents in socially disadvantaged contexts, parents with pre-existing mental health difficulties, and parents facing significant COVID-19 related work changes.",Elizabeth Westrupp et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B8-78B-514,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B8-78B-514,2020-10-27,2020-10-31T21:13:42+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; achieving in life; families; standard of living; personal safety; personal health; parent; australia; community-connectedness; personal relationships; future security; subjective wellbeing; covid-19 pandemic,False

217,Does the COVID-19 war metaphor influence reasoning? Socio-political factors mediate the framing effect.,"In recent times, many alarm bells have begun to sound: the metaphorical presentation of the COVID-19 emergency as a war might be dangerous, because it could affect the way people conceptualize the pandemic, and react to it, leading citizens to endorse authoritarianism and limitations to civil liberties. The idea that conceptual metaphors actually influence reasoning has been corroborated by Thibodeau and Boroditsky, who showed that when crime is metaphorically presented as a beast, readers become more enforcement-oriented than when crime is metaphorically framed as a virus. Recently, Steen, Reijnierse and Burgers replied that this metaphorical framing effect does not seem to occur and suggested that the question should be rephrased about the conditions under which metaphors do or do not influence our reasoning. In this paper, we investigate whether presenting the COVID-19 pandemic as a war has an effect on people’s reasoning about the pandemic. Data collected suggest that when the metaphorical framing effect occurs, it is mediated by socio-political individual variables such as speakers’ political orientation and their kind of source of information: right wings participants and those relying on independent sources of information are those more conditioned by the COVID-19 war metaphor in reasoning and opinion formation.",Francesca Panzeri et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EB-784-53F,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EB-784-53F,2020-10-30,2020-10-31T18:28:14+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Language; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics; conceptual metaphor theory; war metaphor; experimental linguistic; covid-19",False
218,Externalizing Behavior and Academic Achievement : Do Causal Relations Exist?,"Children’s low academic skills are associated with a variety of behavior problems and maladaptive outcomes throughout childhood and adulthood. Given the prevalence of behavioral disorders is approximately 19% of all US children, understanding of the mechanisms through which academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems interact can inform effective intervention to prevent persistent academic failure, chronic behavioral difficulties, and related negative long-term outcomes. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to systematically review research on the association between low academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems, as well as evaluate the research indicating causal linkages, if any, between the two domains. Five databases were searched, including OVID Medline, PsycInfo, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, Education Resource and PROQUEST. Search terms included statistical designs that could support a hypothetical causal association (e.g., structural equation modeling). We screened a total of 1,990 studies, of which 26 met the final inclusion criteria. In total, ten studies reported significant negative effects between the two domains, of which only six reported effect sizes that could be considered meaningful. All but two reported these effects in the direction of early externalizing behavior problems to later academic achievement. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence for either a causal or predictive relationship. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.",Tara Kulkarni et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-9C2-1D9,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-9C2-1D9,2020-07-15,2020-10-31T14:41:41+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Consultation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology|Intervention; externalizing; schools; trajectories; latent class growth analysis; problem behavior; academic achievement,False
219,"Unwillingness to engage in behaviors that protect against COVID-19: Conspiracy, trust, reactance, and endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine","Background: We investigated if people’s unwillingness to comply with the official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic is driven by conspiracy beliefs, state reactance, a distrust in information sources, and an endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Methods: The sample consisted of 1325 Finnish adults who filled out an online survey marketed on Facebook. Structural regression analysis was used to investigate whether: 1) conspiracy beliefs, state reactance, a distrust in information sources, and endorsement of CAM predict people’s willingness to adhere to the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented by the government during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in information sources and endorsement of CAM are related to people’s willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Individuals with higher state reactance, a lower trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were less likely to comply with the NPIs. Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were also more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusions: Responding with state reactance towards government measures, distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are associated with a lower intent to engage in health protective behavior during COVID-19. These findings highlight the need for governments and health authorities to create communication strategies that build public trust and minimize the risk of reactance.",Anna Soveri et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46253-6B0-140,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46253-6B0-140,2020-10-30,2020-10-30T13:21:44+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; non-pharmaceutical interventions; trust; conspiracy beliefs; vaccination; complementary and alternative medicine; covid-19; cam; npi; reactance,False
220,The quality of research on mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review,"Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This systematic review aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open science practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases on the 13th of May. Empirical studies, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, between February and May 2020, were included. The dependent variable(s) required to be quantitative and related to mental health. Exclusion criteria included clinical pharmacological trials, and studies using psychophysiological or biological recordings. The study protocol was previously pre-registered in https://osf.io/bk3gw/. Findings: Twenty-eight studies were identified. More than 75% met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, 89.3% used convenience samples and 92.86% lacked of a priori power analysis. There was low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies (0%) and availability of databases (3.57%), which raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Interpretation: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good science.",Ines Nieto et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7,2020-07-14,2020-10-30T08:09:44+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; systematic review; research quality; covid-19; mental health",False

In this study, the effects on fear, anxiety and wellbeing of the recent pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 were investigated in a sample of otherwise healthy Hungarians. Taking the family as a microsystem, differences in gender, age, family relationships and time spent in isolation were the main focus of this investigation. 346 parent-child dyads were examined; the children were 11-17 years of age. Standard psychological questionnaires (Perceived Stress Scale, WHO Wellbeing Index), and an open question test (the Metamorphosis test) were used, and the results analysed with the aid of basic statistical methods. Stress levels and wellbeing displayed a significant negative correlation with each other in both parents and children. Parental stress and levels of wellbeing had a weak but significant impact on the wellbeing of their children. Among the demographic variables examined, none of them was found to explain the wellbeing or stress level of parents. Natural catastrophes, such as pandemics, create a stressful social environment for parents, and therefore directly impact the psychological wellbeing of all family members.",Gabor Csikos et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-BC7-DA8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-BC7-DA8,2020-07-16,2020-10-29T22:13:11+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; adolescent; pandemic; children; covid-19; family; anxiety; resilience; stress; fear,False

However, given researchers’ focus on group-level differences within disorder-specific treatments, it is unclear which transdiagnostic mechanisms influence these effects. Participants (n=19, Mage=31.8, 68% female, 95% Caucasian) with elevated emotion dysregulation completed daily reports of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a DBT skills training group (1,344 observations). We tested whether within-person skill use was associated with same-day negative affect, predicted next-day changes in negative affect, and was moderated by perceived emotion regulation effectiveness. Participants used more within-person skills on days of greater stress and anxiety, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety. On days of high, but not low, perceived effectiveness, people used more skills in response to more intense negative affect. The use, and perceived effectiveness, of more skills may be mechanisms by which DBT skills groups promote improved emotional functioning.",Matthew W.

223,Mental and social health in the German old age population largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown: results of a representative survey,"Background: Older individuals are at increased risk of a severe and lethal course of COVID-19. They have typically been advised to practice particularly restrictive social distancing (‘cocooning’), which has sparked much debate on mental and social health consequences in older individuals. We aim to provide evidence. Methods: A computer-assisted standardized telephone interview was conducted in a randomly selected and representative sample of the German old age population (n = 1,005; age ≥65 years) during lockdown in April 2020. Assessments included sociodemographic factors, aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown, attitudes towards COVID-19, and standardized screening measures on depression, anxiety, somatization, posttraumatic stress, perceived stress, loneliness and social support. Sampling-weighted descriptive statistics and multiple multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Results: Participants were M = 75.5 (SD = 7.1) years old; 56.3% were women. At data collection, COVID-19 lockdown had been in force for M = 28.0 (SD = 4.8) days. Overall, older individuals were worried about COVID-19, but supportive of the lockdown. Mean scores and prevalence estimates of measured mental and social health variables were comparable to figures reported before the pandemic, except slightly higher perceived stress and higher perceived social support. There were only few significant associations of aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown and attitudes towards COVID-19 with mental and social health variables, while resilience explained a large amount of variance. Conclusions: In the short-term, the mental and social health of the German old age population was largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting resilience against the challenging pandemic situation. Our results refute common ageist stereotypes of “the weak and vulnerable elderly” that were present during the pandemic.

224,Predicting COVID-19 conspiracist ideation from the Dark Tetrad traits,"Previous research has suggested that the Dark Triad traits and, specifically, Machiavellianism and psychopathy, are associated with a tendency to believe in conspiracy theories. The current study (N = 203) aimed to replicate and extend the existing research by examining the relationship between the Dark Tetrad traits—Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and everyday sadism—and a novel measure of COVID-19 conspiracist ideation. Machiavellian views and psychopathic antisociality were significant positive predictors of the tendency to believe in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, even when accounting for the participants’ knowledge about COVID-19.

225,Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS),"Abstract Parenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on children’s socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage children’s social and emotional needs, structure children’s activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.",Rebecca Waller et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3,2020-07-14,2020-10-29T21:35:50+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; home environment; children; covid-19; adolescence; parenting practices; parent-child relationships; parenting; family; dads; childhood; parents; moms,False
226,Beliefs in COVID-19 conspiracy theories predict lower level of compliance with the preventive measures both directly and indirectly by lowering trust in government medical officials,"The COVID-19 pandemic represents a global health crisis, making compliance with governmental policies and public health advice crucial in decreasing transmission rates. At the same time, we are faced with the rapid spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive power of COVID-19 conspiracy theories in explaining the level of compliance with official COVID-19 guidelines, by including mediating roles of pseudoscientific information beliefs and trust in government officials. A total of 1882 participants provided sociodemographic information and completed all measures in the study. Multiple mediation analysis revealed a direct negative effect of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs on the compliance with the preventive measures. In addition, conspiracy beliefs were indirectly associated with compliance via trust in government officials. The present study builds upon emerging research showing that conspiracy beliefs have potentially significant social consequences.

227,Bargaining under social distancing requirements: Effects of face masks on socio-economic decision-making in the COVID-19 pandemic,"Face masks play a pivotal role in the control and prevention of respiratory diseases, such as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Despite their widespread use, it is not known how face masks affect human social interaction. In this behavioral economics study (N = 475), we examined how mask-wearing modulates individuals’ likelihood of acceptance of unfair monetary offers in an iterated social exchange. Overall, participants accepted more offers, including more unfair offers, from mask-wearing opponents than from opponents without a mask.

228,Examining Mindset and Grit in Concurrent and Future Reading Comprehension: A Twin Study,"Non-cognitive factors have gained attention in recent years as potential intervention targets for academic achievement improvement in students. Two notable facets, intelligence mindset and grit, have been of particular interest. Both have been shown to consistently improve educational outcomes, although little work has focused on reading ability. We used a correlational and twin method design to preliminary test if mindset and grit could be potential intervention targets to increase reading ability. As such, we examined the relation between both grit and mindset on current, future, and change in reading comprehension ability in a twin sample. We used data from 422 twin pairs (171 monozygotic pairs, 251 dizygotic pairs) drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, Behavior and Environment (Taylor et al., 2019). Twins were on average 13 years old when the questionnaire and first reading ability measure were collected, and on average 15 years old when the second reading ability measure was collected. Weak and moderate positive correlations were found between both mindset and grit with each reading ability score and neither were significantly related to change in reading ability. Twin modeling suggested little to no common genetic or environmental influences between mindset and grit to reading ability. In total, our results do not lend support to the notion of mindset or grit being a mechanism of change for reading ability.",Kimberly M.

229,"The irrational interplay between partisanship, beliefs about the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and support for policy interventions","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that has forced governments around the world to implement large-scale interventions such as school closures and national lockdowns. Previous research has shown that partisanship plays a major role in explaining public attitudes towards these policies and beliefs about the severity of the crisis. However, the cognitive roots of this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In principle, partisan gaps in policy support could emerge from cost-benefit analyses from individuals with dissimilar perceptions about the severity of the pandemic, as proposed by rational models of partisan behavior. Alternatively, polarized responses may be driven by social identity motives that are unrelated to individual beliefs, as predicted by theories of tribal partisanship. Here, we tested the predictions of these two models across four experiments (N=1980) performed in four different countries (Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and the United States). Participants forecasted the number of COVID-19 deaths in their country after considering either a high or low number. Then, they rated their agreement with a series of interventions. This anchoring procedure, which experimentally induced a large variability in the forecasted number of deaths, did not modify policy preferences. Instead, we observed that partisanship independently modulated the optimism of forecasts and participants’ support for COVID-19 policies. These results, which are against the predictions of the rational partisanship model, have strong policy implications. In particular, our findings suggest that communication strategies aimed at informing the public about the severity of the pandemic will not substantially change levels of support for COVID-19 interventions.",Lucia Freira et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611F-32E-655,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611F-32E-655,2020-10-29,2020-10-29T08:26:07+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Politics; anchoring; partisanship; policy; rational; covid-19; forecasts,False
230,Polygenic Risk Score for Smoking is associated with Externalizing Psychopathology and Disinhibited Personality Traits but not Internalizing Psychopathology in Adolescence,"Importance: Large consortia of genome wide association studies have yielded more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate the small effects of many genetic variants to characterize the genetic architecture of disorders and provide a personalized measure of genetic risk. Objective: We examined whether a PRS for smoking measured genetic risk for general behavioral disinhibition by estimating its associations with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and related personality traits. We examined these associations at multiple time points in adolescence using more refined phenotypes defined by stable characteristics across time and at young ages, which reduced potential confounds associated with cumulative exposure to substances and reverse causality. Methods: Random intercept panel models were fit to symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems and personality traits at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old in the Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 3225). Results: The smoking PRS had strong associations with the random intercept factors for all the externalizing measures (mean standardized ꞵ = .27), agreeableness (ꞵ=-.22, 95% CI: -.28, -.16), and conscientiousness (ꞵ=-.19, 95% CI: -.24, -.13), but was not significantly associated with the internalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .06) or extraversion (ꞵ=.01, 95% CI: -.05, .07). After controlling for smoking at age 17, the associations with the externalizing measures (mean ꞵ = .13) and personality traits related to behavioral control (mean ꞵ = -.10) remained statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The smoking PRS measures genetic influences that contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition including externalizing psychopathology and normal-range personality traits related to behavioral control, but not internalizing psychopathology. Continuing to identify the correlates and delineate the mechanisms of the genetic influences associated with disinhibition could have substantial impact in mitigating a variety of public health problems (e.g., mental health, academic achievement, criminality).",Brian M.

231,Same or different? A multi-method review on the relationships between processes underlying executive control,"Attention, working memory, and executive control are commonly considered distinct cognitive functions with important reciprocal interactions. Lesion studies pioneered by Donald Stuss have demonstrated both overlap and dissociation in their behavioral expression and anatomical underpinnings. Here, we provide an overview of cognitive models as well as recent data from lesion studies and both invasive and noninvasive multimodal neuroimaging and brain stimulation, in order to provide an updated perspective on the relationship between attention, working memory, and executive control. Specifically, we address the functional and anatomical correspondence between these processes, toward the goal of identifying whether a lower dimensional theoretical framework should be employed to understand executive control (Karolis et al., 2019). We conclude by emphasizing that one avenue for moving the field, pioneered by Donald Stuss, forward consists of studying this low-dimensional space with a multi-method approach to identify converging evidence regarding the interaction between subfunctions, allowing to construct a model of executive control as the emergent consequence of efficient implementation of these processes.",Monica N.

232,Alcohol and substance use in pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rates of alcohol and substance use raises significant concerns, as substances may be coping mechanisms for social isolation and/or disruptions to employment and the economy. Pregnant women are currently experiencing unusually high rates of anxiety and depression symptoms and may be especially affected. We analysed results from an ongoing study of pregnant individuals in Canada: Pregnancy during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Participants were asked about current substance during pregnancy, and concerns about the threat of COVID-19 to their baby’s life, decreased quality of prenatal care, and whether they felt more socially isolated, experienced financial difficulties, or lost their job. The percentage of participants reporting use during pregnancy was 6.9% for alcohol, 3.7% for cannabis, 3.5% for tobacco, and 0.2% for illicit drugs. Odds for cannabis use increased by 0.9% for each unit increase in concern about lower quality prenatal care and by 2.1% for each unit increase in financial difficulties. Odds for tobacco use increased by 220.0% for loss of employment. COVID-19 concerns did not significantly predict alcohol use. Comprehensive public health strategies, including access to perinatal, mental health, and financial supports, as well as education around the effects of prenatal exposures and the possible effects of COVID-19 on the mother and baby, are important to facilitate healthy coping mechanisms for mothers, reduce substance use in pregnancy, and mitigate poor perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for babies.",Preeti Kar et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-EA9-B48,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-EA9-B48,2020-07-07,2020-10-27T15:13:23+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,False
233,Cyclical Across-Day Dynamics of Corona-Related Media Exposure and Worries in People’s Daily Lives During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objective: This study investigated how Corona-related media exposure during the COVID-19 crisis was related to same-day and next-day Corona-related worries. Methods: A sample of 561 participants (Mage = 42.79, SDage = 6.12) completed online questionnaires across 21 days between late March and April 2020 in Germany. Every evening, they indicated their exposure to Corona-related media (e.g., TV, print, online) and their Corona-related worries on that day. Results: Same-day analyses showed that participants reported more Corona-related worries on days with higher exposure to Corona-related media. Examining the across-day relations among Corona-related media exposure and worries using dynamical structural equation models, there was evidence for a reciprocal cycle: Higher media exposure at one day predicted higher worries the next day, and higher worries at one day also predicted higher media exposure the next day. Individuals with high trait anxiety reported an enhanced general level of Corona-related media exposure during the 21 days of assessment, and individuals high in neuroticism and anxiety reported an enhanced level of Corona-related worries. Conclusions: These findings suggest a self-reinforcing cycle of crisis-related media exposure and worries. As such, the daily amount people spend consuming crisis-related information might augment crisis-related worries, amplifying adverse health effects of the COVID-19 crisis and other crises alike.",Andrea Schmidt et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-FF9-E4A,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FD-FF9-E4A,2020-06-17,2020-10-27T14:59:00+00:00,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; covid-19; within-person dynamics; worry; media exposure; ambulatory assessment; daily diary; well-being",False
234,Enhancing the Effectiveness of Contact Tracing Interviews Using Psychological Science,"Contact tracing is vital to controlling the spread of disease. This process relies on effective recall of past interactions during contact tracing interviews; as such, psychological science suggests that limitations on human memory and cognition could hinder contact tracing efforts. Methods for enhancing memory performance have been widely addressed within the psychological literature. Further, there is evidence that self-administered interviews are an effective way to gather information while conserving person power. The current experiment leveraged the unique conditions of an ongoing pandemic and research on both memory and self-administered interviewing to compare two interviews: an enhanced cognitive protocol based on best practices in investigative interviewing, and a control interview that aligned with current practices for COVID-19 contact tracing interviews. Each protocol was tested via two modalities: an interviewer-led audio-only Zoom call and a self-led online survey. Across 200 interviews with adults throughout the United States, the enhanced protocol increased the number of contacts reported by more than 50% as compared to the control protocol. Modality (i.e., call vs. online survey) had neither a main nor moderating effect on recall. These findings suggest that implementing psychologically-informed interview techniques can significantly increase the number of contacts that infected persons can report. Further, these improvements can be realized in an interviewer-free context, reducing time and resource requirements.",Jacqueline R.

235,A short-form version of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale: Initial development of the IUS-5,"Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is an individual´s ""tendency to be bothered or upset by the (as yet) unknown elements of a situation, whether the possible outcome is negative or not."" This construct, originally proposed in the context of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), is now considered a transdiagnostic construct. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS; Freeston, Rhéaume, Letarte, Dugas, & Ladouceur, 1994) has been the gold standard measure for IU, both the original 27-item and the 12-item (IUS-12; Carleton, Norton, & Asmundson, 2007) versions. The present study, conducted in the context of a broader research project about IU and the COVID-pandemic by the UNiCORN team, aims to develop an even shorter version of the IUS, both psychometrically sound and quicker to administer, which would increase its utility in research studies with an elevated number of measures. Initial analyses conducted in currently available data from four countries (UK, Italy, Spain and Greece) suggest that it is possible to reduce the IUS-12 to 5 items, including two items measuring desire for predictability, one item assessing uncertainty paralysis, and two items describing aversiveness of uncertainty. The five-item version of the questionnaire (IUS-5) showed adequate internal consistency across languages (English, Italian, Spanish, Greek) and across situations (e.g., before and during COVID-19), and its total score is highly correlated with the total score of the IUS-12.

236,Protocol for the Canadian Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and countermeasures implemented by governments around the world have led to dramatically increased symptoms of depression and anxiety. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of COVD-19 public health measures, because they represent a demographic that is most affected by disasters and because pregnancy itself entails significant life changes that require major psychosocial and emotional adjustments. The Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PdP) study was designed to investigate the associations between exposure to objective hardship caused by the pandemic, perceived stress and psychological distress in pregnant individuals, and developmental outcomes in their offspring. Methods The PdP study comprises a prospective longitudinal cohort of pregnant individuals (at enrollment) with repeated follow-ups during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Participants were eligible if they were: pregnant, ≥17 years, ≤35 weeks gestation at study enrollment, living in Canada, and able to read and write in English or French. Participant recruitment via social media (Facebook, Instagram) began on April 5, 2020 and is ongoing. At enrollment, participants completed an initial survey that assessed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, previous pregnancies and births, pre-pregnancy health, health conditions during pregnancy, medications, psychological distress, social support, and hardships experienced because of COVID-19 (e.g., lost employment, loved one dying). For the first three months following the initial survey, participants received a monthly email link to complete a follow-up survey that asked about experiences since the previous survey. After three months, follow-up surveys were sent bi-monthly to reduce participant burden. For each of these surveys, participants were first asked if they were still pregnant and then routed either to the next prenatal survey or to the delivery survey. In the postpartum, surveys were sent at 3-, 6-, and 12-months of infant age to assess maternal psychological distress and infant development. Discussion This longitudinal investigation seeks to elucidate the associations between hardships, maternal psychological distress, child development during COVID-19, and risk and resilience factors that amplify or ameliorate these associations. Findings are intended to generate knowledge about the psychological consequences of pandemics on pregnant individuals and point toward prevention and intervention targets.",Gerald Giesbrecht,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602C-D25-F53,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602C-D25-F53,2020-10-02,2020-10-27T14:52:20+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy,False
237,Resilience During Uncertainty? Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue,"Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.",Jonas P.

238,Personality Traits and Narccissism as Predictors of Pathological Selfie Among University Undergraduates in Nigeria,"This study examined personality traits and narcissistic as predictors of pathological selfie among undergraduates of university of Ilorin. An ex post-facto design using survey method was adopted while three hundred respondents (110 males and 190 females), participated in the study. Their age ranged from 16 years to 35years. A questionnaire pack which included-the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-16 (NPI-16); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and Selfie Behaviour Scale (SBS) was utilized. The results of t-test revealed that gender do not significantly influence pathological selfies (t=.763; df= 298; p>.05). However, there was a significant difference in the participants type of phones on selfie pathology (t (120)=-3.01, p<.05); respondents with smart phones (M=56.89, SD=10.25) significantly reported higher scores on pathological selfies compare to respondents with non-smart phones (M=53.23, SD=9.75). Multiple regression result showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism and narcissism jointly predicted pathological selfies (R=.49; R2=.29; F(6, 293)=15.09; p<.01). However, extraversion (β =.20; t =2.91; p<.05); agreeableness (β= -.29; t =-4.03; p<.01) conscientiousness (β=.24; t=3.90; p<.01); neuroticism (β = .19; t=3.91; p<.05) and narcissism (β=.22; t =3.91; p<.05) had independent significant prediction of pathological selfies.

239,"Loneliness, college belongingness, subjective vitality, and psychological adjustment during coronavirus pandemic: Development of the College Belongingness","Loneliness is a serious risk factor for healthy development and flourishing. Although loneliness has been revealed to play an important role in psychological health and well-being, little is known about moderating and mitigating mechanisms underlying this association, especially, during adverse experiences (e.g., coronavirus pandemic). The current study purposed to explore whether subjective vitality mediated the association of loneliness with psychological well-being (i.e., psychological adjustment), and whether college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on students’ well-being in the context of loneliness. The sample of this study comprised of 333 undergraduate students (69% female) from a state university in Turkey. They ranged in age between 19 and 45 years (M= 22.13, SD= 4.55). Findings from mediation analysis revealed that loneliness had a significant predictive effect on subjective vitality and psychological adjustment challenges. Subjective vitality also mediated the effect of loneliness on psychological adjustment of college students. Further, college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on adjustment and had a protective effect on the association between loneliness and subjective vitality in college students.

To our knowledge, no research has employed qualitative methodologies in order to examine this. We therefore aim to address this gap in research by qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to qualitatively examine the lived experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one broadly captured present and future challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic. Theme two captured the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs and theme three captured HCPs’ perceptions of the attitudes of the general public towards HCPs.

241,Sleep health in U.S. adults before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Understanding how health has changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to reducing and recovering from the pandemic. This study focused on how sleep health in the United States may have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep duration and number of days in the past week with difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and not feeling rested in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected before the COVID-19 outbreak (2018 National Health Interview Survey, n = 19,433) was compared to the same measures in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults collected during the COVID-19 outbreak (2020 Luc.id, n = 2,059). Sleep duration was slightly shorter in 2020 than 2018 (d = -.05). Moreover, the prevalence of insufficient sleep duration (RR = 1.20) and the number of days with difficulty falling asleep (d = .54), difficulty staying asleep (d =.36), and not feeling rested (d = .14) was greater in 2020 than 2018. Twice as many people in 2020 reported experiencing at least one night of difficulty falling asleep (RR = 1.95) or staying asleep (RR = 1.75). Adults younger than 60 and those who belonged to an Asian racial group had larger differences than other age and racial groups between 2018 and 2020. Thus, sleep health in U.S. adults was worse in 2020 than in 2018, particularly in younger and Asian adults.

242,Poor quality of sleep and its consequences on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected all Italy. The extreme virulence, the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. Methods Through an internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole COVID-19 lockdown (from 10thMarch – 1st phase - to 4th May – 2nd phase). We investigated the socio-demographic and COVID-19 related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study - sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales – 21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. Results 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers reveal several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died due to COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythm characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, extremely severe levels of stress, of anxiety, and of depression. Conclusions This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole lockdown in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population have had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be taken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 health emergency.",Christian Franceschini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46228-DDF-9E6,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46228-DDF-9E6,2020-07-25,2020-10-27T08:01:25+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Sleep-wake Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; risk factor; italian lockdown; depression; sleep quality; stress; clinical psychology; sleep habits; covid-19,False
243,Individual differences in susceptibility to false memories for COVID-19 fake news,"Exposure to ‘fake news’ can result in false memories, with possible consequences for downstream behaviour. Given the sharp rise in online misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that influence the development of false memories. In a large, preregistered study (N = 3,746) we measured susceptibility to false memories following exposure to fabricated news stories about the pandemic, and investigated the effect of individual differences in (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) engagement with media or discussion about the coronavirus, (3) anxiety about COVID-19 and (4) analytical reasoning. We report that objectively-assessed knowledge about COVID-19 was associated with fewer false memories and with better discrimination between true and false stories. In contrast, participants who believed themselves to be very knowledgeable were more likely to report a memory for any story, true or false. Individuals who reported high levels of media engagement or anxiety about COVID-19 were also biased towards ‘remembering’ any given story, while also showed heightened sensitivity to the difference between true and false stories. Finally, higher levels of analytical reasoning were associated with fewer false memories and with a stricter threshold for reporting a memory for any story. These data suggest that false memories can form in response to fake COVID-19 news, and that susceptibility to this misinformation is affected by the individual’s knowledge about and interaction with COVID-19 information, as well as their tendency to think critically.",Ciara Greene et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-B2C-BED,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-B2C-BED,2020-07-24,2020-10-27T07:30:49+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Memory; fake news; covid-19; misinformation; coronavirus; false memories,False
244,Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the U.S.,"Background: Stressful events due to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity/reliability of the PSQ and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.",Autumn Kujawa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,2020-06-29,2020-10-26T23:54:22+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; young adult; coronavirus; pandemics; depression; anxiety,False
245,Application of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-6 (SAVE-6) and Coronavirus Anxiety scales (CAS) to measure cancer patient anxiety in response to the COVID-19,"This study investigated the usefulness of the 6-item Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics (SAVE-6) scale and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) as tools to assess anxiety related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in cancer patients. A total of 221 patients with cancer responded to an anonymous online questionnaire between July 15 and August 15, 2020. The functional impairment of the patients was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the SAVE-6 and CAS were also applied. Among these 221 cancer patients, 110 (49.8%) had SAVE-6 scores ≥15 and 21 (9.5%) had CAS scores ≥5. Within the study population, 104 (47.1%) and 29 (13.1%) patients had WSAS scores ≥11 (moderate to severe functional impairment) and ≥21 (severe functional impairment), respectively. The correlations between the SAVE-6 and WSAS (p < 0.001) and CAS (p < 0.001) scores were statistically significant. The cut-off for the SAVE-6 was 15 points, while that for the WSAS was 11. Our results suggested that the SAVE-6 and CAS could be used to evaluate moderate and severe degrees of functional impairment related to mental health, respectively, in cancer patients during viral epidemics.",Myung Hee Ahn et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E4-66C-75C,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E4-66C-75C,2020-09-09,2020-10-26T22:07:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; anxiety; cancer; covid-19; mental health,False
246,The Strategic Use of Nudging and Behavioural Approaches in Public Health Policy during the Coronavirus Crisis,"Nudging and behavioural insights need to be taken into account in strategic action planning for suppression and reduction of pandemic effects.

247,Psychometric Evaluation of The Fear of COVID-19 Scale Among Chinese Population,"Background. Fear is a negative emotional reaction to or persistent worry over an imminent public health event like COVID-19. The COVID-Fear Scale was developed in many countries, but not in China. The current study aims to examined the psychometric properties of Chinese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Methods. Translation into Chinese and back-translation into English were conducted firstly. Item analysis and exploratory factor analysis in Sample 1, followed by validity tests in Sample 2). Likely, test-rest reliability was conducted in Sample 3. Results. A bifactor structure of Chinese version of FCV-19S with a general fear factor and two orthogonal group factors with fear thoughts and physical response was confirmed. Besides, it has good internal consistency reliability (α=.92), composite reliability (CR=.92) and validity correlation validity. Conclusion. The results of the present study confirmed that the Chinese version of FCV-19S has good psychometric properties in the Chinese communities.",Xinli Chi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CC-C87-228,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CC-C87-228,2020-07-29,2020-10-26T17:32:14+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; validity; reliability; fear of covid-19 scale,False
248,Depression symptoms mediate mismatch between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and diminished compliance with prevention measures,"Without any known vaccine or cure, sustaining individuals’ cooperation in following prevention measures is crucial to prevent spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Here, we monitored national representative samples with changes in beliefs about the pandemic, depressive symptoms, and motivation to comply with prevention measures between the end of the first wave (Time1) and beginning of the second wave (Time2) of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Participants’ beliefs about the pandemic closely reflected the change of the COVID-19 situations. Strikingly, inconsistent with the accurate belief update, individuals regarded social distancing less important and externalized their motives to comply with preventive measures more at Time2 than Time1. This mismatch was mediated by depressive symptoms, such that increased depressive symptoms followed by negative belief change were associated with decreased perceived importance of social distancing and voluntary motivation. Our data highlights the importance of considering psychological reactions in promoting individuals’ compliance with prevention measures.",Jiwon Park et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974,2020-07-29,2020-10-26T17:13:34+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social distancing; belief; covid-19; depression,False
249,Identification of socio-cognitive determinants of parental sun protection behaviors to optimize intervention development,"Background: Adequate sun safety during childhood is crucial for decreasing skin cancer risk in later life. Although parents are an essential target group in applying sun protection measures for their children, interventions are often not directed at parents. This study identifies the most relevant determinants in predicting parental sun protection intentions and behaviors to provide guidance for future intervention development. Methods: A longitudinal survey study with two measurements was conducted among Dutch parents (N=670) of children (4-12 years old). Twenty-seven socio-cognitive determinants were examined in terms of relevance regarding four parental sun protection behaviors in different sun exposure situations. The CIBER approach was used to visualize room for improvement (sample means) on all determinants and their association strengths (correlations) with sun protection intentions and behaviors. Results: Behavior-specific rather than generic determinants were most relevant in explaining all sun protection behaviors. Of these determinants, attitude, self-efficacy and action planning, and especially parental feelings of difficulty in performing sun protection behaviors, were most relevant. Altogether, the explained variance of all socio-cognitive determinants was highest for shade-seeking behavior (R2= .41 and .43) and lowest for supportive behavior (R2=.19 and .29) in both planned and incidental sun exposure situations respectively. Discussion: This study provides detailed insight into relevant socio-cognitive determinants of parental sun protection behaviors in various sun exposure situations. This insight provides guidance for composing parental skin cancer prevention interventions. Future composition of sun safety interventions should emphasize on enhancing parental feelings of self-efficacy, especially for shade-seeking and clothing behaviors.",Karlijn Thoonen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-161-6B8,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-161-6B8,2020-07-30,2020-10-26T15:58:52+00:00,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; parent-to-child behavior; children's health; skin cancer prevention; sun protection behavior; understanding health behavior; health psychology,False
