Victim vs. survivor: the effect of labels and consensual sexual behaviour on observers' perceptions of sexual assault,"Labels guide our perceptions of ambiguous events (Eberdhardt, Dasgupta, & Banaszynski, 2003). They influence the way people interpret othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behaviours, attribute blame, and offer support in situations of sexual violence (Campbell, 2008; Marks & An, 2019). The present study investigated the effect of labels and consensual sexual behaviour on observers' perceptions of hypothetical situations of sexual assault. Further, we examined their effect on the perceived amount of social support offered to affected women. The relationship between labels and consensual sexual behaviour with sexual attitudes was also examined. Participants were 137 undergraduates (52 men and 85 women) from an Indian private university. Results showed that labels and consensual sexual behaviour have some effect on the perceived severity of the assault, perceived responsibility of the women, and the amount of social support offered to them. The findings underscored the importance of labels and cautioned against their arbitrary use. Further implications are discussed.",Aanchal Setia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46131-0B2-F86,20200101,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2788,FALSE,,
Effects of natural environment on mental health: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses,"Objectives: To synthesize the evidence on the effects of exposure to natural environment on mental health to inform future policymaking, practice, and research. Methods: A systematic search of nine major databases and additional sources were conducted using relevant keywords for the natural environment and mental health till November 2019. We included systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting any measures of associations between the natural environment and mental health. The data on study characteristics and research findings were extracted using the JBI data extraction tool and synthesized narratively. Results: Twenty reviews were included in this umbrella review reporting both correlational and experimental studies. Among diverse population groups, the exposure to the natural environment was associated with improvements in depressive symptoms, anxiety, mood disorders, stress, cognitive and emotional functions, affect, happiness, and overall mental wellbeing. Conclusions: The findings of this review inform beneficial mental health outcomes associated with exposure to the natural environment. This umbrella review suggests collaborative policymaking, advanced research, and evidence-based practice protecting the natural environment and improving mental health across populations.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-A59-E15,20200108,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2789,FALSE,,
Should corrections of the literature influence grant review?,"The effect of retractions on the career of scientists is an emerging issue and can be assessed, for example, through citation patterns for articles by authors with retractions. Other possible influences are not well known, but they are worth investigating in a time of changing perceptions of impact and of which factors should influence the reward systems of science. Although academia has cultivated a ""culture of impact"" in science, rigor and the reliability of the research record seem to be gradually taking a stronger role in today's scientific zeitgeist, as suggested in a recent Nature commentary (Casadevall, 2019). However, the extent to which this shifting panorama may influence, for example, grant review criteria is an open question. As part of an ongoing project, we present results of a qualitative pilot study with a group of funders/review panel members who shared their views on the possible role of retractions and of self-correcting the literature in funding decisions. Their comments reflect the difficulty of dealing with retractions in the review of applications for funding. However, they also lend credence to the idea that a broader look at the impact of correction of the literature on research assessment is warranted in this time of changing notions of rewards in science.",Mariana Dias Ribeiro et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-87D-995,20200110,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2790,FALSE,,
Prevalence of mental disorders in South Asia: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses,"Objectives: Mental disorders are highly prevalent in eight South Asian countries, yet there is a gap of a synthesized overview of the prevalence of mental disorders in this region. This umbrella review aims to summarize the prevalence of mental disorders from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of South Asian studies. Materials and methods: A systematic search of 11 major databases and additional sources was conducted until December 11, 2019. Articles were included if they were systematic reviews or meta-analyses, reported the prevalence of mental disorders, and reported primary studies conducted in South Asian countries only. Results: Among 2591 citations, a total of 23 reviews met all the criteria of this umbrella review. The synthesized findings from those reviews suggest high prevalence rates for mental disorders, including depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, mood disorders, suicidal behavior and self-harm, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, dementia, and other mental health problems. Also, findings suggest a high burden of maternal depression, psychiatric comorbidities in chronic physical illnesses, and various mental disorders among children, elderly adults, refugees, and other vulnerable populations. Most studies were from India whereas evidence from Afghanistan, Bhutan, and Maldives was limited. Conclusion: The findings of this review are constrained with heterogeneity in prevalence estimations, methodologies, sampling issues, and limitations in the existing literature, which should be addressed in future research. The evidence synthesized in this review provides national and regional overview of the prevalence of mental disorders, which may inform better policymaking and practice advancing mental health in South Asia.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46171-FC9-13D,20200111,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2791,FALSE,,
Developmental relations between ADHD symptoms and bullying perpetration and victimisation in adolescence,"It has previously been hypothesised that individuals with elevated ADHD symptoms are at greater risk of bullying perpetration and victimization; however, a lack of high-quality longitudinal data has meant that this hypothesis is yet to be adequately tested. Using autoregressive latent trajectory models with structured residuals (ALT-SR) and four waves (ages 11, 13, 15 and 17) of longitudinal data from the BLINDED STUDY NAME (n=1526, 52% male), we evaluated the developmental relations between ADHD and bullying using both self- and teacher-reported ADHD symptom data. Analyses suggested that ADHD symptoms primarily increase the risk of bullying perpetration, with a within-person effect of ADHD symptoms on bullying perpetration symptoms identified across ages 13 to 15 (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²=.13) and ages 15 to 17 (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²=.19) based on self-reported ADHD symptoms; and a similar effect identified across ages 11 to 13 (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²=.24) and 13 to 15 (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â²=.29) based on teacher-reported inattention symptoms. There were also some indications of reciprocal effects and effects involving victimization that merit further exploration in future research. Results imply that the content of bullying intervention and prevention programs should take account of ADHD symptoms in order to ensure that those with elevated ADHD symptoms can benefit from these interventions as much as their typically developing peers. This will involve addressing bullying perpetration that may reflect impulsive/reactive aggression and impaired social skills rather than instrumental aggression. Further, programs should go beyond classical curriculum/classroom-based delivery to ensure that individuals with elevated ADHD symptoms can be successfully engaged.",Aja Louise Murray et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46202-913-BC9,20200119,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2792,FALSE,,
More Efficient Shielding for Internal than External Attention? Evidence from Asymmetrical Switch Costs,"At present, the process of switching attention between external stimuli and internal representations is not well understood. To address this, Verschooren and colleagues (2019) recently designed a novel paradigm where participants were cued to switch attention between external and internal information on a trial-by-trial basis. The authors observed an asymmetrical switch cost, which was larger when switching towards internal than external material, even though participants performed internal trials faster. In the current study, we sought to establish the cause of this asymmetry by adjudicating between predictions from three theoretical accounts: associative interference, priming, and memory retrieval. After replicating the original asymmetry (Experiment 1), we demonstrate that trial-by-trial carryover of attentional settings is not a necessary precondition (Experiment 2). The results from Experiment 3 indicate that the cost asymmetry can be best explained by an associative interference account, against a memory retrieval one. Together, these results therefor provide evidence in favor of an associative interference account and document that shielding attention for internal representations from external intrusions is more efficient than the other way around. This finding advances our understanding of a core aspect of cognitive flexibility and the relationship between external and internal attention. More research on this question and novel ones raised by it is necessary, however.",Sam Verschooren et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46227-138-D45,20200123,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2793,FALSE,,
Standalone Apps for Anxiety and Depression Show Promising Early Efficacy: A Synthesis of Meta-Analytic Results,"Given the high incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders and the very few persons who receive treatment for these disorders (Wilhelm et al., 2019), researchers have become increasingly interested in standalone treatments for anxiety and depression. As the ubiquity of smartphones has grown across the globe, both academia and industry alike are increasingly developing and testing standalone interventions which might treat anxiety and depressive symptoms. In a recent meta-analysis, Weisel et al. (2019) summarized and concluded that apps contribute to significant reductions in depressive symptoms (HedgesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ g = 0.33) but no significant reductions in anxiety symptoms. The paper concludes that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsmartphone apps as standalone psychological interventions cannot be recommended based on the current level of evidenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â.

How do recall requirements affect decision-making in free recall initiation? A linear ballistic accumulator approach,"Models of free recall describe free recall initiation as a decision-making process in which items compete to be retrieved. Recently, Osth and Farrell (2019) applied evidence accumulation models to complete RT distributions and serial positions of participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ first recalls in free recall which resulted in some novel conclusions about primacy and recency effects. Specifically, the results of the modeling favored an account in which primacy was due to reinstatement of the start-of-the-list and recency was found to be exponential in shape. In this work, we examine what happens when participants are given alternative recall instructions. Prior work has demonstrated weaker primacy and greater recency when fewer items are required to report (Ward & Tan, 2019), and a key question is whether this change in instructions affects which items are in competition for recall, or the parameters of the recall competition. We conducted an experiment where participants studied 12 item lists and were post-cued as to whether to retrieve a single item, or as many items as possible. Subsequently, we applied LBA models with various assumptions about primacy and recency, implemented using hierarchical Bayesian techniques. While greater recency was observed when only one item was required for output, the model selection did not suggest there were qualitative differences between the two conditions. Specifically, start-of-list reinstatement and exponential recency functions were favored in both conditions.",Adam F Osth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E9-FE1-239,20200203,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2795,FALSE,,
Informal caregiving and quality of life among older adults: Prospective analyses from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH),"Providing unpaid informal care to someone who is ill or disabled is a common experience in later life. While a supportive and potentially rewarding role, informal care can become a time and emotionally demanding activity, which may hinder older adultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ quality of life. In a context of rising demand for informal carers, we investigated how caregiving states and transitions are linked to overall levels and changes in quality of life, and how the relationship varies according to care intensity and burden. We used fixed effects and change analyses to examine six-wave panel data (2008ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2018) from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH, n=5076; ages 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“74). The CASP-19 scale is used to assess both positive and negative aspects of older adultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ quality of life. Caregiving was related with lower levels of quality of life in a graded manner, with those providing more weekly hours and reporting greater burden experiencing larger declines. Two-year transitions corresponding to starting, ceasing and continuing care provision were associated with lower levels of quality of life, compared to continuously not caregiving. Starting and ceasing caregiving were associated with negative and positive changes in quality of life score, respectively, suggesting that cessation of care leads to improvements despite persistent lower overall levels of quality of life. Measures to reduce care burden or time spent providing informal care are likely to improve the quality of life of older people.",Lawrence B Sacco et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DD-D42-290,20200203,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2796,FALSE,,
A Systematic Review Exploring the Impact of Social Media on Breastfeeding Practices,"Social media has potential to promote and support positive health behaviours. This systematic review explores the influence of social media on breastfeeding decision-making, promotion and support. For the purpose of the review, social media was defined as social networking sites and blogs; M-technology and apps were only considered if they included an interactive element, such as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“shareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ function, or one-to-many communication. Searches were conducted across seven databases (limited to 2007-2019). An initial search identified 1,123 papers, of which 16 met the inclusion criteria. A second search conducted prior to publication identified an additional six relevant papers, increasing the total to 22 included papers. Results are mixed, but there is evidence that social media can be used to improve breastfeeding awareness and attitudes. Breastfeeding mothers value pro-breastfeeding online communities. However, the success of such social media groups may be dependent on specific content shared, individual contributors, and group dynamics. Key considerations for practitioners are offered regarding how social media can augment services offered to support breastfeeding. Research in this field is still very much in its infancy. Further investigation of specific social media content is needed, alongside the viewpoints of those who have ceased breastfeeding against their wishes.",Lisa Orchard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-6DF-802,20200203,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2797,FALSE,,
Public Perceptions of Biofuels - Case Study: Frames of Biofuel Discussion in the Finnish Context,"Biofuels are fuels made of biological materials and they can be used in cars, trucks and other engines. The EU's policy and regulatory framework for bioeconomy and biofuels is seen as a multi-layered and complex issue. Policies around biofuels have developed recently in the EU. Renewable Energy Directive II established a binding target for the use of renewable energy across the European Union by 2030 to be 32% of the total energy production. Finland is a country where the utilization of forest biomass has traditions ranging back centuries and continues in the present day with bioenergy holding a central role in the Finnish energy matrix. Our case study is focused on examining the public perceptions of biofuels in Finland and is linked to the discussion about climate change, global warming, and sustainable development. We used a stakeholder approach and mapped key stakeholders in the biofuel sector in Finland from six stakeholder categories: corporations, governmental actors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), municipalities, universities, and the media. We selected 59 online publications for our analysis from a time period between 2010-2019. Frame analysis was conducted using three pairs of polarised frames: environmental positive and negative, economic positive and negative, and technological positive and negative. The results show that for the most part the framing of biofuel discussion in Finland is positive and emphasizes the environmentally and economically positive aspects. The negative aspects that came to front are especially in the notions of economic costs and in arguments for environmental calculations. The EU legislation itself is seen as a background to all this discussion and is itself not scrutinized extensively by the various stakeholders.",Elina Siivari et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-1D8-1AC,20200204,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2798,FALSE,,
"A Word of Caution about Many Labs 4: If You Fail to Follow Your Preregistered Plan, You May Fail to Find a Real Effect","A team of 37 researchers (Many Labs 4; Klein et al., 2019) has recently reported that it has failed to replicate the effect of mortality salience on worldview defense ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a classic finding from terror management theory (TMT). This collaborative project (21 labs, N = 2220) has the potential to provide useful information regarding the robustness of an often-replicated and influential empirical finding. However, Klein et al. (2019) deviated from their preregistered plan by including smaller samples than specified in their pre-registration. This undisclosed deviation from their plan is problematic because it undermines the potential benefits of pre-registration; indeed, the negative results of their meta-analyses appear to be predominantly driven by small studies. We reanalyzed the Many Labs 4 data after excluding studies that did not meet the preregistered minimum sample size (40 participants per cell). Results showed that the data actually do replicate the original study. This successful replication emerged only in the expert advice variation of these studies, which addresses one of the purposes of this study by showing that replication is more likely to occur when researchers follow the advice of researchers with considerable experience in this domain. We discuss the importance of following preregistered plans to avoid misleading conclusions and potential issues involved with literal replications of effects that may depend on societal zeitgeist at the time data are collected.",Armand Chatard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-42B-C0C,20200207,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2799,FALSE,,
Cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression relate differentially to longitudinal structural brain development across adolescence,"The ability to regulate emotions is crucial for well-being and adaptive social functioning. Emotional disorders commonly emerge in adolescence, a period characterized by changes in emotion and emotion-related processes, making emotion regulation a principal developmental task. Concurrently, the brain undergoes large structural and functional changes. We investigated relationships between two emotion regulation strategies, cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, and development of cortical thickness, as well as amygdala and nucleus accumbens volumes. A total of 112 participants (59 females) aged 8-19 at inclusion were followed for up to 3 times over a 7-year-period, providing 272 observations. Participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ), yielding measures of cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression. Relations between emotion regulation and brain development were analyzed using linear mixed models. Contrary to expectations, volumetric growth of amygdala and nucleus accumbens was not associated with either emotion regulation strategy. However, frequent use of expressive suppression was linked to greater regionally specific apparent cortical thinning in both sexes, while cognitive reappraisal was associated with greater regionally specific apparent thinning in females and less thinning in males. In contrast to the traditionally emphasized role of frontal control regions in cognitive reappraisal, the results also imply involvement of cortical regions associated with social cognition and semantics.",Lia Ferschmann et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622C-D98-873,20200207,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2800,FALSE,,
Social and Economic Costs of Attention- Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Across the Lifespan,"Objectives: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is prevalent though few studies have comprehensively considered the total social and economic impacts of ADHD across the lifespan. Methods: The costs of ADHD in Australia were estimated for the financial year 2018-19 using a prevalence approach to cost estimation across all ages. This entailed calculating the financial costs attached to healthcare, productivity, and education and justice systems, as well as deadweight losses. Non-financial wellbeing costs (Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)) were added to these financial costings. Results: The total social and economic cost of ADHD in 2018-19 were AUD20.4 billion, a per person cost of AUD25,071 per year. Productivity costs make up 81% of the total financial costs, followed by deadweight losses (11%), health system costs (6%), with other costs including educational and crime and justice costs of 3%. In addition to imposing significant financial costs, ADHD results in impaired functioning that leads to a significant loss in terms of wellbeing (AUD7.6 billion).

Exploring the Use of Immersive Virtual Reality to enhance psychological wellbeing in Pediatric Oncology,"Background Objectives: To investigate whether Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) has a greater positive influence on oncology patientsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ physical and emotional mood states when compared to an iPad attentional control condition. Our secondary objective was to understand what factors influenced VR effectiveness. Method: Participants were 90 oncology inpatients, aged 7-19 years, and their primary parent caregiver. Using a randomised controlled study design patients were allocated to VR (three content groups) or an iPad control condition. Pre-post-intervention self-report state measures were collected using visual analogue scales and an objective measure of physiological arousal (pulse rate). Post-intervention, patients reported on level of immersion, enjoyment and simulator sickness. Results: Patients benefited from both Immersive VR and novel iPad intervention with no statistically significant differences found between conditions on child outcomes. However, patients accessing Immersive VR consistently reported greater positive shifts in mood state and reductions in negative symptoms when compared with iPad. No change was observed in physiological arousal levels (pulse rate) in either condition before, during or immediately after intervention. Moderation analysis showed that the degree of child illness (PedsQL), sex, age, and level of immersion were important in influencing the magnitude of differences between the VR and iPad conditions on mood, anxiety and pain. Conclusion: These preliminary findings support the use of Immersive VR in clinical oncology settings to improve patient wellbeing. Further studies examining the application of Immersive VR in supporting children adjusting to hospitalization and cancer treatment are therefore warranted.

The processing of pseudoword form and meaning in production and comprehension: A computational modeling approach using Linear Discriminative Learning,"Pseudowords have long served as key tools in psycholinguistic investigations of the lexicon. A common assumption underlying the use of pseudowords is that they are devoid of meaning: Comparing words and pseudowords may then shed light on how meaningful linguistic elements are processed differently from meaningless sound strings. However, pseudowords may in fact carry meaning. On the basis of a computational model of lexical processing, Linear Discriminative Learning (LDL Baayen et al., 2019), we compute numeric vectors representing the semantics of pseudowords. We demonstrate that quantitative measures gauging the semantic neighborhoods of pseudowords predict reaction times in the Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) database (Tucker et al., 2018). We also show that the model successfully predicts the acoustic durations of pseudowords. Importantly, model predictions hinge on the hypothesis that the mechanisms underlying speech production and comprehension interact. Thus, pseudowords emerge as an outstanding tool for gauging the resonance between production and comprehension. Many pseudowords in the MALD database contain inflectional suffixes. Unlike many contemporary models, LDL captures the semantic commonalities of forms sharing inflectional exponents without using the linguistic construct of morphemes. We discuss methodological and theoretical implications for models of lexical processing and morphological theory. The results of this study, complementing those on real words reported in Baayen et al. (2019), thus provide further evidence for the usefulness of LDL both as a cognitive model of the mental lexicon, and as a tool for generating new quantitative measures that are predictive for human lexical processing.",Yu-Ying Chuang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46107-19A-790,20200219,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2803,FALSE,,

Developmental change in partition dependent resource allocation behavior,"Partition dependence, the tendency to distribute choices differently based on the way options are grouped, has important implications for decision making. This phenomenon, observed in adults across a variety of contexts such as allocating resources or making selections from a menu of items, can bias decision makers toward some choices and away from others. Only one study to date (Reichelson, Zax, Patalano, & Barth, 2019) has investigated the developmental trajectory of this phenomenon. In the current study we investigate childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and adultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ susceptibility to partitioning effects in a child-friendly resource allocation task. In Experiment 1 (N = 80), adults distributed 12 food tokens to animals at the zoo. Based on previous findings that older children show weaker partition dependence in this task, we predicted that adults might exhibit reduced partition dependent behavior: they showed none. In Experiment 2 (N = 272), we used a less transparent task with only five food tokens, predicting that both adults and children (ages 3-10 years) would show partition dependence. Children, but not adults, made partition dependent resource allocations, with younger children exhibiting greater effects than older children. These experiments provide further evidence that childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s decisions, like adultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ (in other tasks), are influenced by the arbitrary partitioning of the available options.

"Chinese publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s knowledge, perceived severity, and perceived controllability of the COVID-19 and their associations with emotional and behavioural reactions, social participation, and precautionary behaviour: A national survey","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused enormous stress among the public in China. Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to control the COVID-19, including the understanding of the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., knowledge, perceived severity and perceived controllability of the COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“90 years, Mage=23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in an online survey. The results showed that the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding the COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of hierarchical regression analysis revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables. Theoretically, the findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern.

The pressure to communicate efficiently continues to shape language use later in life,"Language use is shaped by a pressure to communicate efficiently, yet the tendency towards redundancy is said to increase in older age. The longstanding assumption is that saying more than is necessary is inefficient and may be driven by age-related decline in inhibition (i.e. the ability to filter out irrelevant information). However, recent work proposes an alternative account of efficiency: In certain contexts, redundancy facilitates communication (e.g., when the colour or size of an object is perceptually salient and its mention aids the listenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s search). A critical question follows: Are older adults indiscriminately redundant, or do they modulate their use of redundant information to facilitate communication?

Intrinsic Religiosity Attenuates the Negative Relationship Between Social Disconnection and Meaning in Life,"Positive social connections are integral to peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience of meaning in their lives.

In a sample of undergraduates, high levels of intrinsicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âbut not extrinsicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âreligiosity attenuated the relationship between social disconnection and decreased meaning in life. Moreover, this attenuation was specific to felt presence of meaning in life, rather than active search for meaning. These results corroborate and expand Chan et al.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s findings and suggest that future research should explore mechanisms by which religious beliefs themselves serve meaning-making functions.",Caleb Joshua Reynolds et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B8-538-BEB,20200304,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2808,FALSE,,
Are people excessively pessimistic about the risk of coronavirus infection?,"The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 in China has raised the spectre of a novel, potentially catastrophic pandemic in both scientific and lay communities throughout the world. In this particular context, people have been accused of being excessively pessimistic regarding the future consequences of this emerging health threat.

Child and Parent Emotion Study (CAPES),"Introduction: Parents shape child emotional competence and mental health via their beliefs about childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotions, emotion-coaching parenting, the emotional climate of the family, and by modelling emotion regulation skills. However, studies to-date have had small samples and focussed on mothers of primary-school age children. Further research is needed to elucidate the direction and timing of associations for mothers and fathers/partners across different stages of child development. The Child and Parent Emotion Study (CAPES) aims to examine longitudinal associations between parent emotion socialisation and child emotion regulation and socio-emotional adjustment at four time-points from pregnancy to age 12. CAPES will investigate the moderating role of parent gender, child temperament and gender, and family background. Methods and analysis: CAPES recruited 2,336 current parents of a child 0-9 years and prospective parents (i.e., women or their partners pregnant with their first child) in 2018-2019. Participants will complete a 20-30 minute online survey at four time-points 12 months apart, to be completed in December 2022. Measures include validated parent-report tools of parent emotion socialisation (i.e., parent beliefs, the family emotional climate, emotion coaching, and parent emotion regulation) and age-sensitive measures of child outcomes (i.e., emotion regulation and socio-emotional adjustment). Analyses will use mixed effects regression to simultaneously assess associations over three time-point transitions (i.e., T1 to T2; T2 to T3; T3 to T4), with exposure variables lagged to estimate how past factors predict outcomes 12 months later. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval for the four time-points has been obtained for this study. We will disseminate results through conferences and open access publications; and results will also inform the development of a new early childhood parenting intervention. We will invite parent end-users to co-develop our dissemination strategy, and discuss the interpretation of key findings prior to publication.",Elizabeth Westrupp et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-254-6EA,20200309,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2810,FALSE,,
Self-control moderates the association between perceived severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and mental health problems among the Chinese public,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of death in China. Prior research suggests that individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceived severity of the COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioural reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this possibility. Participants were 4,607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage=23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for demographic variables, perceived severity of the COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œperceived severity of the COVID-19 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ mental health problemsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â association, with the said link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased.

THE EVOLUTION OF AIRBNB REGULATION - An International Longitudinal Investigation 2008-2020,"Peer-to-peer accommodation has been extensively studied over the past decade. The area that has most fascinated academic researchers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and most challenged policy-makers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is how to regulate peer-to-peer accommodation to avoid negative side effects, without restricting economic benefits (Dolnicar, 2019). Regulations are typically reported as individual case studies at one point in time (Hajibaba & Dolnicar, 2017). Yet they are continuously evolving. Policy makers put them in place, only to later change them, sometimes radically, as in the case of Tasmania (Grimmer, Vorobjovas-Pinta & Massey, 2019). This is the first study investigating Airbnb regulations at key international tourist destinations longitudinally. We (1) develop a typology of destinations based on their regulatory reaction to Airbnb, and (2) identify key regulatory aims, and specific measures for policy makers to achieve those aims.",Dorine Von Briel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C6-D54-D1B,20200312,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2812,FALSE,,
Mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for infection prevention: A systematic umbrella review of the global evidence,"Background: Transmission of infectious diseases is often prevented by quarantine and isolation of the populations at risk. These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases. Materials and methods: We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. Results: Among 1364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes. Conclusion: This umbrella review found severe mental health problems among individuals and populations who have undergone quarantine and isolation in different contexts. This evidence necessitates multipronged interventions including policy measures for strengthening mental health services globally and promoting psychosocial wellbeing among high-risk populations.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-800-4E6,20200313,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2813,FALSE,,

Understanding peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flood-related behaviours may assist in the development of more effective strategies aimed at lessening the impact of floods including mortality and morbidity. This systematic review examined peer-reviewed literature published from January-1989 to April-2019 on human behaviour in and around floodwater to identify behaviour patterns as well as protective and risk factors. We extracted three main themes from a thematic analysis of included studies (N=54): activities and risk-taking behaviours (n=24); loss reduction, knowledge, and warnings (n=37); and diet and hygiene (n=4). This review had limitations which prevented definitive conclusions being made. What does seem apparent is the limited knowledge of the social psychological mechanisms that guide behavioural responses in a flood event. Further exploration of methods to improve preparedness, increase the likelihood of evacuation, and reduce ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“riskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behaviour during floods is needed.

"Still Separate in STEM?: Trends in Sex Segregation by Field of Study in Japan, 1975-2019","There is much evidence to suggest that the gender wage gap in Japan is one of the highest in rich countries, while gender inequality in education at the vertical level is becoming increasingly equalized. A small number of studies suggest that the remaining gender gap can be attributed to horizontal segregation with respect to field of study, particularly female underrepresentation in STEM fields, and little is known about trends in sex segregation by field in Japan specifically. By using publicly available education statistics, the current study investigates these trends from 1975 through 2019. We paid particular attention to (1) different trends in non-STEM, STEM, and health fields, and (2) heterogeneity across national, public, and private institutions. The results of applying DuncanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dissimilarity index to 68 fields of study among four-year university students reveal that the overall trend in sex segregation in field of study has decreased over the 45 years by 43%. We also found that trends differ based on both institutional characteristics of universities and academic field, as the declining segregation trend is mainly driven by the massive integration of men and women in non-STEM fields in private institutions. The declining trend in segregation has been slow in recent years, especially at national and public institutions. We explored potential mechanisms for these stalling trends, and suggest that the driving forces are (1) a slower integration of women in STEM fields and (2) a rise in segregation in health fields. These results provide support for the theory of a stalled gender revolution in Japan. This study concludes that the desegregation may not be linked to the gender equality in the labor market, and that horizontal segregation may even increase because of the growing demand for the workforce to deal with population aging in the future.",Fumiya Uchikoshi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46238-43E-4B0,20200316,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2815,FALSE,,
Fighting COVID-19 misinformation on social media: Experimental evidence for a scalable accuracy nudge intervention,"Across two studies with over 1,600 U.S. adults recruited online, we present evidence that people share false claims about COVID-19 partly because they simply fail to think sufficiently about whether or not content is accurate when deciding what to share. In Study 1, participants were far worse at discerning between true and false content when deciding what they would share on social media relative to when they are asked directly about accuracy. Furthermore, cognitive reflection and science knowledge were associated with stronger discernment. In Study 2, we found that a simple accuracy reminder at the beginning of the study ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ i.e., judging the accuracy of a non-COVID-19-related headline ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ more than doubled the level of truth discernment in participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sharing intentions.

CORONAVIRUS AND AIRBNB ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Disrupting the Disruptor,"Has coronavirus disrupted the disruptor?

The first premise of our prediction is that coronavirus is representative of any kind of major shock that has the potential to affect the tourism industry. The second premise is that the consequences of this super-shock are asymmetric. Different types of hosts will face different types of challenges as a consequence of the sudden and unexpected drop in demand. Investors who are in the business of short term rental to make commercial profits will find themselves in a situation where they still have expenses, but no more income. Some of these investors will re-assess the risk of short-term rental and never return to Airbnb.

"Policy response, social media and science journalism for the sustainability of the public health system amid the COVID-19 outbreak: The Vietnam lessons","Having geographical proximity and a high volume of trade with China, the first country to record an outbreak of the new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), Vietnam was expected to have a high risk of transmission. However, as of 4 April 2020, in comparison to attempts to containing the disease around the world, responses from Vietnam are seen as prompt and effective in protecting the interests of its citizens, with 239 confirmed cases and no fatalities. This study analyzes the situation in terms of VietnamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s policy response, social media and science journalism. A self-made web crawl engine was used to scan and collect official media news related to COVID-19 between the beginning of January and April 4, yielding a comprehensive dataset of 14,952 news items. The findings shed light on how VietnamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âdespite being under-resourcedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âhas demonstrated political readiness to combat the emerging pandemic since the earliest days. Timely communication on any developments of the outbreak from the government and the media, combined with up-to-date research on the new virus by the Vietnamese science community, have altogether provided reliable sources of information. By emphasizing the need for immediate and genuine cooperation between government, civil society and private individuals, the case study offers valuable lessons for other nations concerning not only the concurrent fight against the COVID-19 pandemic but also the overall responses to a public health crisis.",Viet-Phuong La et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46144-76C-300,20200318,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2818,FALSE,,
Trauma or Drama: A Predictive Processing Perspective on the Continuum of Stress,"The notion of trauma has been liberally used both in clinical literature and general discourse. However, no consensus exists on its exact meaning and definition. Whereas traditionally trauma has been mostly associated with criterion A of acute and post-traumatic stress disorders as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, many researchers find this definition too constraining and not accounting for the complexity and many aspects of psychological trauma. This touched off a quest for a broader more accommodating trauma concept, and a dimensional view of trauma has been suggested with PTSD as its extreme manifestation. The dimensional view also has its detractors arguing that a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconceptual bracket creepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â may undermine the categoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s utility. Both categorical and dimensional views mostly rely on traumaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clinical phenomenology and lack a unified theoretical basis. In an attempt to reconcile this contradiction, a hybrid categorical-dimensional model of trauma based on the general theory of stress has been recently proposed (Krupnik, 2019). In this report, we explore the categorical boundary of the trauma concept, as posited by the model, within the predictive processing framework (PPF). We integrate the PPF view with the theory of stress. In conclusion, we briefly discuss how the proposed model of trauma may guide clinical practice.",Valery Krupnik,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46086-E73-534,20200319,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2819,FALSE,,
A Breeding Pool of Ideas: Analyzing Interdisciplinary Collaborations at the Complex Systems Summer School,"Interdisciplinary research is essential for the study of complex systems, and so there is a growing need to understand the factors that facilitate collaboration across diverse fields of study. In this exploratory research, we examine the formation of self-organized project groups and the structure of collaboration networks at the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School. Using data from all iterations of the summer school from 2005 to 2019, comprising 779 participants and 304 projects, we investigate the factors influencing group formation. We find that group formation at the Summer School based on gender, position, affiliation, country of study, and discipline is largely consistent with random mixing. Similarly, using standard network measurements, we find that no single discipline is more prone to interdisciplinary collaboration than any other; nor do participants from any particular discipline exert stronger influence in the network. While our results point to a high degree of interdisciplinary collaboration overall, project topics from the social and behavioral sciences are significantly over-represented. This could be due to a higher level of baseline interest in, or knowledge of, social and behavioral sciences, or the common application of methods from the natural sciences to topics in the social sciences. Consequently, future research should explore this discrepancy further and examine whether it can be mitigated through policies aimed at making topics in other disciplines more accessible or appealing for collaboration.",Jacqueline Brown et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A6-DC9-868,20200319,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2820,FALSE,,
The effectiveness of moral messages on public health behavioral intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic,"With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening millions of lives, changing our behaviors to prevent the spread of the disease is a moral imperative. Here, we investigated the persuasiveness of messages inspired by three major moral traditions. A sample of US participants representative for age, sex and race/ethnicity (N=1032) viewed messages from either a leader or citizen containing deontological, virtue-based, utilitarian, or non-moral justifications for adopting social distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We measured the messagesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ effects on participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ self-reported intentions to wash hands, avoid social gatherings, self-isolate, and share health messages, as well as their beliefs about othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ intentions, impressions of the messengerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s morality and trustworthiness, and beliefs about personal control and responsibility for preventing the spread of disease. Consistent with our pre-registered predictions, compared to non-moral control messages, deontological arguments had a modest effect on intentions to share the message. Message source (leader vs. citizen) did not moderate any of the observed effects of message type. A majority of participants predicted the utilitarian message would be most effective, but we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions or beliefs. We caution that our findings require confirmation in replication studies and are modest in size, likely due to ceiling effects on our measures of behavioral intentions and strong heterogeneity across all dependent measures along several demographic dimensions including age, self-identified gender, self-identified race, political conservatism, and religiosity. Although we found no evidence that the utilitarian message was effective in changing intentions and beliefs, exploratory analyses showed that individual differences in one key dimension of utilitarianismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âimpartial concern for the greater goodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âwere strongly and positively associated with public health intentions and beliefs. Overall, our preliminary results suggest that public health messaging focused on duties and responsibilities toward family, friends and fellow citizens is a promising approach for future studies of interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the US. Ongoing work is investigating the reproducibility and generalizability of our findings across different populations, what aspects of deontological messages may drive their persuasive effects, and how such messages can be most effectively delivered across global populations.",Jim Albert Charlton Everett et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D4-7A6-341,20200320,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2821,FALSE,,
Will consumption rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic? A structural equation modeling research based on the psychological arousal theory,"At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in Wuhan, which quickly became a major public health emergency with the fastest spread, the broadest range of infection, and the most difficult to control in the history of modern China. During the outbreak, 1.4 billion Chinese people suspended almost all social activities and stay at home. Although the prevention of the pandemic seems effective, China's consumer economy suffered a heavy blow in the first quarter of 2020. With the COVID-19 outbreak gradually controlled in China, many retail businesses are pinning their hopes on the rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic. This study discusses the psychological mechanism of the consumption rebound and the possible duration of this rebound with the theory of psychological arousal. Based on the results of structural equation modeling of 1464 Chinese people, this study found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the perceived severity of the pandemic caused an insufficient level of psychological arousal and lead to a higher tendency of sensation seeking, and this will increase people's willingness to spend after the end of the pandemic. The results revealed that it might lead to a rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic, but this rebound is concentrated and short-lived. This study suggests that retail businesses need to realize that the rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic is not due to a sudden increase in social spending power, but because consumers urgently need to restore the normal level of psychological arousal through the sensory stimulation brought by consumption. Therefore, retail businesses should not only pay attention to deal with the rapid rebound in consumption after the end of the pandemic, but also prepare plans for the normalization of consumption after the rebound weakens.",Shichang Deng et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-B9B-1FC,20200323,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2822,FALSE,,
"Psychological Correlates of News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors among US Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, it is critical to understand the psychological factors that influence pandemic-related behaviors (i.e., news monitoring, social distancing, hygiene/disinfecting, hoarding). This may be especially important to study among youth, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological correlates of adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Self-report survey conducted between March 20th and March 22nd, 2020. Setting: This is an online survey study of youth from the United States. Participants: A population-based sample of adolescents were recruited via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Youth were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were between the ages of 13 and 18. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors over the 7 days after the US declared a national emergency. The correlates measured were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, values related to social responsibility, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, along with greater social responsibility and social trust, would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The final analytic sample included 770 adolescents (Mage = 16.34, 72% female). The majority of teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (70%), but were monitoring the news (75%) and engaging in at least one disinfecting behavior multiple times per day (88%). Some teens reported engaging in hoarding behavior (19%). Greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing, disinfecting, and news monitoring, but also more hoarding. Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting and news monitoring, and less hoarding. Participants who reported valuing their own self-interest over others reported less social distancing and more hoarding. Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding. Conclusions and Relevance: Emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following recommended preventative health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.",Benjamin Oosterhoff et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611C-096-689,20200323,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2823,FALSE,,
Individual differences in accepting personal restrictions to fight the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a Danish adult sample,"Political authorities are working hard on fighting the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

In a sample of Danish adults (N = 799) randomly drawn from a representative sample, we link different personality characteristics to peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s willingness in accepting personal restrictions for fighting COVID-19. When simultaneously considering all characteristics including the basic traits from the HEXACO personality model, we find that, next to peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s age, Emotionality as well as the Dark Factor of Personality (D) explain who is more willing to accept restrictions.

The emotional path to action: Empathy promotes physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents a major challenge to societies all over the globe. To curb the spread of the disease, one measure implemented in many countries is minimizing close contact between people (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œphysical distancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â). Engaging in physical distancing is a prosocial act in the sense that it helps protecting other individuals, especially those most vulnerable to the virus.

We also summarize literature evidence about reluctance to change social behavior and disregard recommendations for social distancing among persons who percept to having low risk of infection or complications, and briefly describe destructive psychological response and misleading communications.

Analytic-Thinking Predicts Hoax Beliefs and Helping Behaviors in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak was labeled a global pandemic by the WHO in March of 2020.

The results of correlation analysis showed that the academic procrastination was negatively correlated with autonomous academic motivations and the level of the satisfaction of basic psychological needs. Path analysis showed that the satisfaction of relatedness and autonomy needs contributed to the satisfaction of competence need, thereby reducing amotivation and increasing intrinsic motivation towards achievement which lead to lower levels of academic procrastination. The findings supported the hypothesis of self-determination theory about the role of meeting basic psychological needs in order to promote intrinsic motivation.]",Quang Ngoc Nguyen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AB-D8F-6DC,20200327,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2831,FALSE,,
Adaptive and Dark Personality Traits in the Covid-19 Pandemic: Predicting Health-behavior Endorsement and the Appeal of Public-health Messages,"Who embraces directions to socially distance, boost hygiene, and protect others during a pandemic of contagious respiratory disease? Do differently phrased public-health messages appeal to different people? I based predictions on the five-factor, triarchic psychopathy, and Dark Triad models of normal-range and dark traits; the extended parallel process model (EPPM); and schema-congruence theory. In a survey of 502 online participants, normal-range traits (esp. agreeableness and conscientiousness) predicted endorsement of social distancing and hygiene, as well as the appeal of health messages in general. Consistent with the EPPM, conscientiousness and neuroticism had an interaction. Dark traits (esp. psychopathy, meanness, and disinhibition) predicted low endorsement of health behaviors and the intent to knowingly expose others to risk. Most participants preferred a message appealing to compassion (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHelp protect the vulnerable...ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â), but dark traits predicted lower appeal of that message.

Myriad incidents of mishaps caused by these rumors was reported across the world. To address this issue the frontline healthcare providers should be equipped with the most recent research findings and accurate information. The mass media, health care organization, community-based organizations, and other important stakeholders should build strategic partnerships and launch common platforms in disseminating authentic public health messages. Advanced technologies like natural language processing or data mining approaches should be applied in detection and removal online content with no scientific basis from all social media platforms.

Trait empathy could affect prosocial willingness indirectly through the empathy level. News discriminability and distance from the outbreak epicentre played a role in the trait empathy change.

Accordingly, health communication should focus on emphasizing a measureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perceived self-protective value by explaining how it would foster public protection that in the long run will protect the individual and the individualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s close relations.",Johannes Leder et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C2-0EB-1BD,20200330,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2837,FALSE,,
Framing COVID-19 as an Existential Threat Predicts Anxious Arousal and Prejudice towards Chinese People,"We tested the hypothesis that perceived existential threat of COVID-19 elicits anxious arousal, which can manifest in prejudice toward the perceived source of the threat (Chinese people). Americans (n = 474) were randomly assigned to an experimental condition in which COVID-19 was framed as an existential threat to the United States or a non-existential threat control condition. They then completed self-report measures of anxious arousal and blatant prejudice towards Chinese people. As expected, participants in the threat (vs. control) condition reported greater anxious arousal which, in turn, predicted greater blatant prejudice. Threat (vs. control) condition also indirectly predicted greater prejudice via greater anxious arousal.

Ample evidence from historical studies (early 1900ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s), modern filtration experiments of different materials and pathogens, and observational studies exists to suggest that mass masking of the community would decrease the transmissivity of SARS-CoV-2 and accelerate the flattening of the curve in which we are engaged. The WHO and CDC claim a lack of randomized trials as rationale for not promoting community use of face masks. But we have shut down the schools, workplaces, and social events. Where are the randomized trials of social distancing? We trust the science on social distancing. Let us trust the science on the community use of face masks. Given the aggressive nature of the pathogen we face we should bring all potential interventions to the fight against COVID-19, including the mass use of face masks of the community. With potentially devastating shortages of N95 respirators and surgical masks for clinicians, community masks should be homemade cloth that are effective at acting as source control interventions.

Individual Psychological Responses to the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Different Clusters and Their Relation to Risk-Reducing Behavior,"Understanding individual difference in psychological responses toward the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) crisis is essential to the adequate handling of the current pandemic. Based on a sample of 1,182 American adult residents (stratified for age and gender; data collection March 13 to 15, 2020), we found three distinct clusters of psychological responses (i.e., informed, panic, and ignorant). Clusters differed regarding their knowledge about the virus, SARS-CoV-2-related anxiety (i.e., worry and emotionality), and evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 crisisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s severity. Cluster membership was strongly associated with both SARS-CoV-2 risk-reducing, reasonable behavior and unreasonable behavior. Finally, clusters could be linked to systematic differences in broader personality dimensions (i.e., Dark Triad and Big Five). Our study provides and validates a set of clusters of individual psychological responses to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the resulting behavior.

Information about pandemic increases negative attitudes toward foreign groups: a case of COVID-19 outbreak,"Pathogen threat can translate into willingness to distance oneself from others also on a psychological level. Building on this notion, we predicted that the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus can affect attitudes toward foreign nationalities. We explored the inter-group consequences of the current epidemiological situation in two studies involving a total of 652 participants. In correlational Study 1, we showed a positive relationship between media exposure in the UK and in Poland and prejudice to four foreign nationalities. The Study 2 showed that negative affect toward Italians (i.e., a nation struggling with the most severe COVID-19 outbreak at the time of the study) was indirectly predicted by exposure to news about Coronavirus through the increase in anxiety. Overall, our studies revealed that prejudice is sensitive to current epidemiological situation and our findings suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 may translate into severe social consequences and increased psychological distancing to nations most affected by the pandemic.",Piotr Sorokowski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F7-DDF-01C,20200331,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2841,FALSE,,
Functional fear predicts public health compliance in the COVID-19 pandemic,"In the current context of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), health professionals are working with social scientists to inform government policy on how to slow the spread of the virus. An increasing amount of social scientific research has looked at the role of public message framing, for instance, but few studies have thus far examined the role of individual differences in emotional and personality-based variables in predicting virus-mitigating behaviors. In this study we recruited a large international community sample (N = 324) to complete measures of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, fear of the virus, moral foundations, political orientation, and behavior change in response to the pandemic. Consistently, the only predictor of positive behavior change (e.g., social distancing, improved hand hygiene) was fear of COVID-19, with no effect of politically-relevant variables.

We use data on diagnosed COVID-19 cases and death counts attributable to COVID-19 by age for China, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the United States, and New York City. We calculate the CFR for each population at the latest data point and also for Italy over time. We use demographic decomposition to break the difference between CFRs into unique contributions arising from the age-structure of confirmed cases and the age-specific case-fatality. In late April 2020, CFRs varied from 2.2% in South Korea to 13.0% in Italy. The age-structure of detected cases often explains more than two thirds of cross-country variation in the CFR. In Italy, the CFR increased from 4.2% to 13.0% between March 9 and April 22, 2020, and more than 90% of the change was due to increasing age-specific case-fatality rates. The importance of the age-structure of confirmed cases likely reflects several factors, including different testing regimes and differences in transmission trajectories; while increasing age-specific case-fatality rates in Italy could indicate other factors, such as the worsening health outcomes of those infected with COVID-19. Our findings lend support to recommendations for data to be disaggregated by age, and potentially other variables, to facilitate a better understanding of population-level differences in CFRs. They also show the need for well designed seroprevalence studies to ascertain the extent to which differences in testing regimes drive differences in the age-structure of detected cases.",Christian Dudel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46177-B00-041,20200401,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2843,FALSE,,
A Retrospective Bayesian Model for Measuring Covariate Effects on Observed COVID-19 Test and Case Counts,"As the COVID-19 outbreak progresses, increasing numbers of researchers are examining how an array of factors either hurt or help the spread of the disease. Unfortunately, the majority of available data, primarily confirmed cases of COVID-19, are widely known to be biased indicators of the spread of the disease. In this paper we present a retrospective Bayesian model that is much simpler than epidemiological models of disease progression but is still able to identify the effect of covariates on the historical infection rate. The model is validated by comparing our estimation of the count of infected to projections from expert surveys and extant disease forecasts. To apply the model, we show that as of April 10th, there are approximately 2 million infected people in the United States, and these people are increasingly concentrated in states with less wealth, better air quality, fewer smokers, fewer people under the age of 18, less public health funding and more cardiovascular deaths. On the other hand, the percentage of foreign born residents and the proportion of people who voted for President Trump in 2016 are not clear predictors of COVID-19 trends.",Robert Kubinec et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-7F3-EA0,20200401,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2844,FALSE,,
The Importance of Cultural Tightness and Government Efficiency For Understanding COVID-19 Growth and Death Rates,"The spread of COVID-19 represents a global public health crisis, yet some nations were more effective than others at limiting the spread of the virus during the early stages of the pandemic. Here we show that institutional and cultural factors combine to partly explain these cross-cultural differences. Nations with tight cultures and efficient governments were the most effective at limiting COVID-19ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growth and mortality rates as of early April, and this interaction of cultural tightness and government efficiency is robust to controlling for underreporting of cases, economic development, inequality, median age, population density, climatological variation, and other dimensions of cross-cultural variation (collectivism, power distance, relational mobility). A formal evolutionary model explores the mechanism that may underlie our findings, suggesting that these cross-cultural trends may be associated with group variation in cooperation under conditions of high threat. These analyses shed light on why some nations contained COVID-19 more effectively than others.",Michele Gelfand et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46012-F1C-0D1,20200401,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2845,FALSE,,
Measuring Realistic and Symbolic Threats of COVID-19 and their Unique Impacts on Wellbeing and Adherence to Public Health Behaviors,"COVID-19 threatens lives, livelihoods, and civic institutions. Although restrictive public health behaviors such as social distancing help manage its impact, these behaviors can further sever our connections to people and institutions that affirm our identities. Three studies (N=1,195) validated a brief 10-item COVID-19 threat scale that assesses 1) realistic threats to physical or financial safety, and 2) symbolic threats to oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sociocultural identity. Studies reveal that both realistic and symbolic threat predict higher distress and lower wellbeing, and demonstrate convergent validity with other measures of threat sensitivity. Importantly, the two kinds of threat diverge in their relationship to restrictive public health behaviors: Realistic threat predicted greater self-reported adherence, whereas symbolic threat predicted less self-reported adherence to social-disconnection behaviors. Symbolic threat also predicted using creative ways to affirm identity even in isolation. Our findings highlight how social psychological theory can be leveraged to understand and predict peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behavior in pandemics.",Frank Kachanoff et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-83E-5EC,20200402,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2846,FALSE,,
Could Attitudes Toward COVID-19 in Spain Render Men More Vulnerable Than Women?,"The COVID-1 pandemic affects the whole world. Spain is 3rd in the world and 2nd in Europe with largest number of diagnosed cases. Spanish citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ attitudes are important in controlling the pandemic. This research assessed key attitudes of the Spanish people toward COVID-19. One study (n =64) was conducted in a shopping center in Madrid and another (n= 640) online. The results of both studies suggest that women in Spain have a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“more responsibleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ attitude toward the COVID-19 than men.

Psychological interventions and the Covid-19 pandemic,"The coronavirus COVID-19 and the global pandemic has already had a substantial disruptive impact on society, posing major challenges to the provision of mental health services in a time of crisis, and carrying the spectre of an increased burden to mental health, both in terms of existing psychiatric disorder, and emerging psychological distress from the pandemic. In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.",FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©lix Inchausti et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CA-D90-38E,20200402,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2848,FALSE,,
Fear of the coronavirus (COVID-19): Predictors in an online study conducted in March 2020,"Fear is an adaptive response in the presence of danger. However, when threat is uncertain and continuous, as in the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, fear can become chronic and burdensome. To better understand predictors of fear of the coronavirus, we conducted an online survey (N = 439) between March 14 and 17, 2020, which started three days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Fear of the coronavirus was assessed with eight questions pertaining to different dimensions of fear (e.g., subjective worry, avoidance, preferential attention) and an open-ended question. The predictors included measures of psychological vulnerability factors (i.e., intolerance of uncertainty, worry, health anxiety), media exposure, and personal relevance (i.e., personal health, risk for loved ones, and risk control). We found that respondents reported a wide range of concerns relating to the coronavirus outbreak, such as the health of their loved ones, collapse of health care systems, and economic consequences. Four predictors for fear of the coronavirus were retained after backward selection in a simultaneous regression analysis: health anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, media use, and risks for loved ones (R2 = .37).

From Helpless to Hero: Promoting Values-Based Behavior and Positive Family Interaction in the Midst of Covid-19,"Parents managing their home environments during government ordered stay-at-home periods are likely to need new skills for occupying their childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time with activities which promote health and emotional well-being. Moreover, parents and children know they need help managing these circumstances. Perhaps for the first time, behavior analysts hold the reinforcers for increasing parental involvement in effective child-rearing practices. In fact, behavior analysts can help parents enlist their children in managing the household by framing their behavior in terms of hidden superpowers. In the current paper, we argue that behavior analysts have a range of tools to offer which are grounded in evidence-based principles, strategies, and kernels, or essential units of behavioral influence. When combined into scheduled daily practices and invoked by children taught to see their use of the tools as nothing short of heroic, these practices function as vaccinations that inoculate families against toxic and unsafe behaviors.",Thomas Szabo et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602C-18C-405,20200403,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2850,FALSE,,
"Differences between health workers and general population in risk perception, behaviors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 spread in Italy.","In this study, we investigated the perception of risk and the worries about COVID-19 infection in both healthcare workers and general population in Italy. We studied the difference in risk perception in these two groups, and how this related to demographic variables and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and death anxiety. To this aim, we administered an online questionnaire about COVID-19 together with other questionnaires assessing the psychological condition of participants. First, we found that the exposition to infection risk, due to living area or job, increased the perceived stress and anxiety (i.e. medical staff in North Italy was more stressed and anxious respect to both medical- and non-medical participants from Center and South Italy). Then, we conducted hierarchical logistic regression models on our data to assess the response odds ratio relatively to each predictor on each dependent variable. We found that health workers reported higher risk perception, level of worry, and knowledge as related to COVID-19 infection compared to general population. Also psychological state, gender, and living area were important predictors of these factors. Instead, judgments about behaviors and containment rules were more linked to demographics, such as gender and alcohol consumption. We discussed these results in the light of risk factors for psychological distress and possible interventions to meet the psychological needs of healthcare workers.",Luca Simione et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A0-E6F-972,20200403,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2851,FALSE,,
A systematic review on the current conceptualisations of successful psychopathy,"The concept of successful psychopathy has been debated for years, however, there is yet no unified approach to its definition and conceptualisation. Such individuals are said to encompass the core traits associated with psychopathy, whilst continuing to function in society, potentially having superior levels of functioning. This review assimilates the existing literature related to successful psychopathy in the general population. An extensive systematic review was performed using four databases, and two key concepts; namely success and psychopathy. After removing duplicates and articles deemed irrelevant, 180 papers were appraised against the reviewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining 19 papers underwent quality control by two raters. A narrative synthesis was performed. The key factors associated with the successful psychopathy construct were fearlessness, stress immunity, social potency, normal or superior cognitive performance, professional achievement, stable socioeconomic status, leadership, pride, and aversion to punishment during conflict. Inconsistent findings were considered a result of the variations in psychopathy measurements used, and a lack of an agreed definition of success. Recommendations are provided for the establishment of a unified framework, and the need for a moderated measure of successful psychopathy to allow more systematic research into the notion of successful psychopathy in the general populations.",Louise Wallace et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605F-650-F96,20200403,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2852,FALSE,,

How should public health messaging frame these measures, which can reasonably be conceptualized as either self-interested actions or cooperative efforts? We measured the influence of three messaging treatments on coronavirus prevention intentions among Americans from Amazon Mechanical Turk. All treatments presented identical COVID-19 information, but emphasized either personal, public, or both personal and public benefits of prevention behaviors. In studies (n = 2176) conducted early in the pandemic (March 14-16, when there were under 2,000 confirmed U.S. cases), we found support for prosocial framing: the Public treatment was more effective than the Personal treatment, and no less effective than the Personal+Public treatment. In studies (n = 3985) conducted later (April 17-30, when there were over 500,000 confirmed U.S. cases), all three treatments were similarly effective. Additionally, across both sets of studies, the perceived public threat of coronavirus predicted prevention intentions more strongly than the perceived personal threat.

Motivating social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic: An online experiment,"Social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic will save lives.

A control group saw a current informational poster. Two treatment groups saw similar posters with messages that highlighted: (i) the risk of transmission to identifiable persons vulnerable to COVID-19; (ii) the exponential nature of transmission. We then measured judgements of behaviours previously identified by focus groups as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmarginalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â (meaning that people were not sure whether they were advisable, such meeting others outdoors, or visiting parents).

In this article, we discuss how the virus has impacted upon the global industry and discuss how automation technologies will be implemented into the industry to ensure a vibrant return to a strong tourism economy.

"Public actors without public values: legitimacy, domination and the regulation of the technology sector","The scale and asymmetry of commercial technology firmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ power over people through data, combined with the increasing involvement of the private sector in public governance, means that increasingly people do not have the ability to opt out of engaging with technology firms. At the same time, those firms are increasingly intervening on the population level in ways that have implications for social and political life. This creates the potential for power relations of domination, and demands that we decide what constitutes the legitimacy to act on the public. Business ethics and private law are not designed to answer these questions, which are primarily political. If people have lost the right to disengage with commercial technologies, we may need to hold the companies that offer them to the same standards to which we hold the public sector. This paper therefore argues for the development of an overarching normative framework for what constitutes non-domination with regard to digital technologies. Such a framework must involve a nuanced idea of political power and accountability that can respond not only to the legality of corporate behaviour, but to its legitimacy.",Linnet Taylor,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602F-0A0-C58,20200403,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2857,FALSE,,

Too bored to bother?

In response, different sets of pandemic containment measures have been employed by several countries. The effectiveness of non-pharmacological measures such as home confinement hinges on adherence by the population. While adherence to these social distancing measures appears to be high in general, adherence might be more challenging for some individuals and complying with these measures might become more difficult the longer they last. Here, we suggest that boredom and self-control are two important psychological concepts for understanding the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures pose to individuals. To maximize adherence to these measures, we propose to consider the specific and combined effects of boredom and self-control demands elicited by this situation on subsequent behavior.",Corinna Martarelli et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46032-F01-2AC,20200404,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2859,FALSE,,
Perceived efficacy of actions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak,"Millions of people have had to change their way of life due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To reduce the spread of the virus, governments have restricted social life habits ranging from physical distancing to enforcing isolation at home. At present, we do not know whether the physical health-related benefits of these countermeasures outweigh potential mental health problems resulting from those restrictions. Here, we assessed in an online survey as how effective a range of countermeasures were perceived, how severely they affected daily life, how much general distress participants were experiencing as well as participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceived control in an early phase of the outbreak in Brazil, Colombia, Germany, Israel, Norway and the US. Most of our over 2000 respondents rated the countermeasures as effective in reducing the outbreak. School closings, but not quarantine, were perceived as having the largest impact on daily life. Participants also rated their own actions as effective. Notably, participants who believed their country reacted too mildly perceived the risk of contracting the virus to be higher, were more worried and scared and perceived governmental actions as less efficient in limiting the outbreak. We also found increased distress levels in those countries with more stringent lockdowns and higher proportion of not being satisfied with governmental actions.

What can scholars learn from Open Source software communities during pandemics,"When the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began on January 31, 2020, no-one could have anticipated the impact that it would have on our scholarly communication and publishing systems.

Predicting a Pandemic: testing crowd wisdom and expert forecasting amidst the novel COVID-19 outbreak,"Taking countermeasures to protect against future events requires predicting what the future will be like. In late 2019, a novel coronavirus known as NCov-2019 emerged in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to most countries in the world. Anticipatory responses by civilians facing the crisis have included self-isolation measures, extreme stockpiling of food or medical supplies, and other forms of preparation to meet the expected crisis. However, no consensus exists as to the accuracy of civilian expectations, nor toward the relative value of different informational sources used by citizens to build these expectations (e.g. mainstream news as opposed to an educational background in virology). In the present study, we used an online survey (n = 333 in final sample) to collect individual characteristics and general knowledge regarding viruses and the novel coronavirus, in addition to their forecasts for the various outcomes expected to result from it in the near future.

Offline and online social contacts could buffer the adverse effects of social restrictions. However, when offline contacts are limited, online contacts can protect mental health from isolation. The findings could speak about the possible temporal evolution by which the length of isolation is associated with worse mental health.

Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods: Data were collected March 29th and 30th 2020, two-weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ motivations to engage in social distancing, social distancing behaviors, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results: The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Engagement in social distancing was not significantly associated with adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mental or social health. However, specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions: Understanding adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ motivations to engage in social distancing may help inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and improve mental and social health during pandemics.",Benjamin Oosterhoff et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-96C-A45,20200406,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2866,FALSE,,
Pandemics meet democracy. Experimental evidence from the COVID-19 crisis in Spain,"The COVID-19 outbreak poses an unprecedented challenge for contemporary democracies. Despite the global scale of the problem, the response has been mainly national, and global coordination has been so far extremely weak. All over the world governments are making use of exceptional powers to enforce lockdowns, often sacrificing civil liberties and profoundly altering the pre-existing power balance, which nurtures fears of an authoritarian turn. Relief packages to mitigate the economic consequences of the lockdowns are being discussed, and there is little doubt that the forthcoming recession will have important distributive consequences. In this paper we study citizens' responses to these democratic dilemmas. We present results from a set of survey experiments run in Spain from March 20 to March 28, together with longitudinal evidence from a panel survey fielded right before and after the virus outbreak. Our findings reveal a strong preference for a national as opposed to a European/international response. The national bias is much stronger for the COVID-19 crisis than for other global problems, such as climate change or international terrorism. We also find widespread demand for strong leadership, willingness to give up individual freedom, and a sharp increase in support for technocratic governance. As such, we document the initial switch in mass public preferences towards technocratic and authoritarian government caused by the pandemic. We discuss to what extent this crisis may contribute to a shift towards a new, self-enforcing political equilibrium.",Francesc Amat et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-A53-AC9,20200406,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2867,FALSE,,
Transcending Time and Space with Digital Emotional Support,"In the current digital age, emotional support is increasingly received through digital devices. However, virtually all studies assessing the benefits of emotional support have focused on in-person support. Using an experience sampling methodology, we assessed participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ negative emotions, digital and in-person support for those emotions, and success in regulating them three times per day for 14 days, thus covering a wide range of digital support scenarios (N = 164 participants with 6,530 collective measurement occasions). We also considered whether participants were alone versus with others at the time of their negative emotion and higher versus lower in social avoidance as plausible moderators of when digital support was utilized and effective. We expected more pronounced use and efficacy of digital support when participants were alone and higher in trait social avoidance. However, digital support was used and perceived as effective for regulating negative emotions regardless of these factors and its beneficial effects were on par with those of traditional in-person support. The unique benefits of digital support may not be restricted to socially isolated or socially avoidant users. These findings are timely given the widespread anxiety and isolation under the current COVID-19 pandemic. If transcending time and space with digital emotional support is the new norm, the good news is that it seems to be working.",Tyler Colasante et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AA-D12-A8B,20200406,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2868,FALSE,,
"Acceptability and Utility of an Open-Access, Online Single-Session Intervention Platform for Adolescent Mental Health","Background. Many youths with mental health needs are unable to access care. Single-session interventions (SSIs) have helped reduce youth psychopathology across multiple trials, suggesting promise to broaden access to effective, low-intensity supports. Online, self-guided SSIs may be especially scalable, particularly if freely available for as-needed use. However, online SSIsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ acceptability and effects have remained unexamined outside of controlled trials, leaving their practical utility poorly understood. Objective. We evaluated the perceived acceptability and proximal effects of Project YES (Youth Empowerment & Support; www.schleiderlab.org/yes), an open-access platform offering three online SSIs for youth internalizing distress. Method. After selecting one of three SSIs to complete, youth participants (ages 11-17 years) reported pre- and post-SSI levels of clinically-relevant outcomes that SSIs may target (e.g. hopelessness; self-hate) and perceived SSI acceptability. User-pattern variables, demographics, and depressive symptoms were collected to characterize youths engaging with YES. Results. From 9/2019-3/2020, 694 youths accessed YES, of whom 539 began and 187 completed a 30-minute, self-guided SSI. SSI completers reported clinically-elevated depressive symptoms, on average, and were diverse on several dimensions (53.75% non-white; 78.10% female; 43.23% sexual minorities). Regardless of SSI selection, completers reported pre- to post-program reductions in hopelessness (dav = .53; dz = .71), self-hate (dav = .32; dz = .61), perceived control (dav = .60; dz = .72) and agency (dav = .39; dz = .50). Youths rated all SSIs as acceptable (e.g., enjoyable; likely to help peers). Conclusions. Results support the perceived acceptability and utility of open-access, free-of-charge SSIs for youth experiencing internalizing distress.",Jessica L.

Modeling compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines: The critical role of trust in science,"The ongoing coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest health crises of our time. In response to this global problem, various institutions around the world had soon issued evidence-based prevention guidelines. However, these guidelines, which were designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and contribute to public well-being, are deliberately disregarded or ignored by some individuals. In the present study, we aimed to develop and test a multivariate model that could help us identify individual characteristics that make a person more/less likely to comply with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. A total of 617 participants took part in the online survey and answered several questions related to socio-demographic variables, political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation, intellectual curiosity, trust in science, COVID-19 risk perception and compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that COVID-19 risk perception and trust in science both independently predict compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, while the remaining variables in the model (political conservatism, religious orthodoxy, conspiracy ideation and intellectual curiosity) do so via the mediating role of trust in science. The described model exhibited an acceptable fit (ÃƒÂÃ¢â‚¬Â¡2(1611) = 2485.84, p < .001, CFI = .91, RMSEA = .032, SMR = .055). These findings thus provide empirical support for the proposed multivariate model and underline the importance of trust in science in explaining the different levels of compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines.",Nejc Plohl et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C1-3AF-55A,20200406,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2870,FALSE,,
Preliminary Investigation of the Association Between COVID-19 and Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the U.S.,"Evidence suggests that the negative consequences of COVID-19 may extend far beyond its considerable death toll, having a significant impact on psychological well-being. Prior work has highlighted that previous epidemics are linked to elevated suicide rates, however, there is no research to date on the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Utilizing an online survey, the current study aimed to better understand the presence, and extent, of the association between COVID-19-related experiences and past-month suicidal thoughts and behaviors among adults in the United States. Results support an association between several COVID-19-related experiences (i.e., general distress, fear of physical harm, effects of social distancing policies) and past-month suicidal ideation and attempts. Further, we found that a significant proportion of those with recent suicidal ideation explicitly link their suicidal thoughts to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses highlight a potential additional link between COVID-19 and suicidal behavior, suggesting that a portion of individuals may be intentionally exposing themselves to the virus with intent to kill themselves. These findings underscore the need for increased suicide risk screening and access to mental health services. Particular attention should be paid to employing public health campaigns to disseminate information on such services in order to reduce the enormity of distress and emotional impairment associated with COVID-19 in the United States.",Brooke A.

Exposure to the Covid-19 pandemic and generosity,"The Covid-19 pandemic is having dramatic consequences across the world and has generated a public debate about how exposure to a pandemic environment affects social behavior: along with signs of increased solidarity such as people hand-making masks for others, we also observe selfish and antisocial behaviors such as harnessing of essential goods. This is a key question because prosocial behaviors are necessary to cope successfully with the pandemic, but the existing evidence provides no clear prediction regarding how prosociality adapts during such a negative shock. Using data from an online experiment with ~1k participants from southern Spain, we study how social behavior evolved in a six-day period in which Covid-19-associated deaths in Spain increased from 900 to above 3000. In our experiment, participants could earn lottery tickets for a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬100-prize and decided whether to donate a fraction to a charity upon winning. We find that actual donations decreased in the period under study, particularly among older peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âthose who face higher mortality rates. Gender, another determinant of Covid-19-associated mortality, does not predict the decrease. In addition, while self-reported social concerns did not change in the same period, expectations about othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ donations decreased along with actual donations. The data suggest that expectations partially mediate the effect of exposure on behavioral change, but they cannot account for the effect of age. Since age is at the center of public debate about mortality while gender receives considerably less attention, our results point to the potential role of public information in behavioral adaptation.",Pablo Branas-Garza et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-B43-1F0,20200407,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2872,FALSE,,
Dispositional and situational attribution of COVID-19 risk: A content analysis of response typology (Version: 1),"Pre-Peer Review Version 1: In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been official health recommendations of social distancing, thorough handwashing, and self-isolation to prevent the spread of the virus. However, compliance with these recommendations has been mixed. We suggest that non-compliance may be justified by oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (mis)perception of their own COVID-19 risk. In this paper, we explore the dispositional and situational attribution of self-reported COVID-19 risk, as per HeiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Attribution Theory. We conducted a content and framework analysis of responses to an online survey, in which participants (N = 114) were asked to rate their likelihood of contracting the COVID-19 virus, before providing textual responses to explain their rating. Overall, we observed that generally, participants who rated their risk to be low made more dispositional attributions (i.e. attributing their risk to factors such as age and own personal hygiene) whereas higher risk participants made more situational attributions (i.e. attributing COVID-19 risk to government decision-making and other peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cleanliness). A finalised framework of five response typologies including intrinsic, behavioural, balanced, contextual, and disengaged responses was systematically applied to the data.

"Digital Pathways, Pandemic Trajectories. Using Google Trends to Track Social Responses to COVID-19","We already know which countries have controlled the spread of COVID-19 better and what ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgood practicesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â have enabled them to do so. Eventually, some of these policies could be replicated in other countries. But it is not enough to make a well-informed public intervention. We also need quickly available indicators of how actively populations are responding to the virus threat because current changes in social behaviour could mean significant differences in the spread of the COVID-19 in two weeks (after the incubation period). In this article, Pablo BeytÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a Reyes and Carlos Cruz Infante explore the potential of Google Trends to quickly track social responses to the pandemic. In all the countries that have reached a downward changepoint in the COVID-19 contagion, an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinformation saturation peakÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â preceded it: people were massively searching for information on the subject over 2 to 5 days, and about a week after the peak of searches was reached, a decline in the growth trend of coronavirus confirmed cases could be observed. Does it make sense to associate a Google search boom with a decrease in transmission trends? The authors propose that the frequency of searches is a quick indicator of 1) peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ concerns on the virus, 2) the development of a more informed citizenry on how to avoid transmission and 3) active social response to the virus spread, which generally lead to a downward change in the contagion trend.",Pablo BeytÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609C-756-FA0,20200408,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2875,FALSE,,
Flattening the Mental Health Curve: COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders are Associated with Alterations in Mental Health Search Behavior in the United States,"Background: COVID-19 has led to dramatic changes globally in personsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ everyday lives. To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries at a national scale. Methods: In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, eleven of the fifty states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the U.S. allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. The current manuscript examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020 across each state and Washington D.C. Specifically, the current manuscript examines differential change in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. Participants included all persons who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, eleven states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. Results: Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. Conclusions: These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediately leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.",Nicholas C.

Do Survey Estimates of the PublicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Compliance with COVID-19 Regulations Suffer from Social Desirability Bias?,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to instate a large number of restrictions on and recommendations for citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behavior. One of our best tools for measuring compliance with these strictures are nationally representative surveys that ask citizens to self-report their behavior. But if respondentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ avoid disclosing socially undesirable behaviors, such as not complying with government strictures in a public health crisis, estimates of compliance will be biased upwards. To assess the magnitude of this problem, this study compares measures of compliance from direct questions to those estimated from list-experiments - a response technique that allows respondents to report illicit behaviors without individual-level detection. Implementing the list-experiment in two separate surveys of Danish citizens (n>5,000), we find no evidence that citizens under-report non-compliant behavior. We therefore conclude that survey estimates of compliance with COVID-19 regulations do not suffer from social desirability bias",Martin VinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦s Larsen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46184-5BD-5E5,20200408,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2877,FALSE,,
Science knowledge and trust in medicine affect individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behavior in pandemic crises,"In pandemic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ behavior has a strong impact on epidemiological processes during critical stages of the outbreak. Engaging in reasonable behavior, such as social distancing, is critical to avoid further spreading an infectious disease or to slow down its spread. However, some individuals also or instead engage in unreasonable behavior, such as panic buying. We investigate why different behavior occurs and how different types of knowledge and trust in medicine can encourage individuals to engage in reasonable behavior and prevent them from engaging in unreasonable behavior. Based on a sample of N = 1,182 adult Americans stratified by age and gender, we conclude that science knowledge has a prophylactic effect: We show that science knowledge helps individuals convert information into knowledge about the coronavirus. This knowledge then helps individuals avoid unreasonable behavior. Individuals lacking coronavirus knowledge and science knowledge still act reasonably when they have a general trust in medicine. Both trust in medicine and knowledge are crucial factors for individuals to act reasonably and avoid unreasonable behavior. Individuals with low knowledge or trust tend to engage in unreasonable behavior. Facilitating science knowledge and reasonable trust in medicine through education and targeted public health messaging are likely to be of fundamental importance for bringing crises such as the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic under control.",Michael Sailer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46041-BA0-CC1,20200409,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2878,FALSE,,

The Relationship between Infection-Avoidance Tendency and Exclusionary Attitudes towards Foreigners: A Case Study of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Japan,"Amidst the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020, this study focused on the preventive behaviours against COVID-19 infection and the exclusionary attitude towards foreigners in Japan. Particularly, we examined the effects of individual differences in the infection-avoidance tendency based on the behavioural immune system. A web survey of 1,248 Japanese citizens aged 18 years or above living in Japan who were registrants of a crowdsourcing service indicated that as the threat of the COVID-19 spread increased, there were tendencies for infection-preventive behaviours to increase. In addition, people with a strong infection-avoidance tendency adopted more preventive actions, regardless of whether they were under normal circumstances or the threat of infection, indicating their strong rejective attitudes towards the Chinese and other foreigners under the threat of infection. This study recorded the behavioural and psychological states of people who were in the midst of rapid and unpredictable real-world changes in the early stages of the infection.

COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN ITALY: ARE WE READY FOR THE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS? BASELINE FINDINGS FROM THE PSYCOVID STUDY,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 pandemic is burning all over the world. National healthcare systems are facing the contagion with incredible strength, but concern regarding psychosocial and economic effects is critically growing. The PsyCovid Study assessed the influence of psychosocial variables on individual differences in the perceived impact of Covid-19 outbreak on health and economy in the Italian population. METHODS: Italian volunteers from different regions completed an online anonymous survey. Main outcomes were the perceived impact of Covid-19 outbreak on health and economy. A two-way MANOVA evaluated differences in main outcomes, with geographical area (northern, central and southern regions) and professional status (healthcare workers or not) as factors. We then tested the relationship linking psychosocial variables (i.e. perceived distress and social isolation, empathy and coping style) to the main outcomes through two different mediation models. RESULTS: 1163 responders completed the survey (835 females; mean age: 42Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±13.5 y.o.; age range: 18-81 y.o.) between March 14 and 21, 2020. Healthcare workers and people living in northern Italy reported significantly worse outbreak impact on health, but not on economy. In the whole sample, distress and loneliness were key variables influencing perceived impact of Covid-19 outbreak on health, while empathy and coping style affected perceived impact on economy. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 pandemic represents a worldwide emergency in term of psychological, social and economic consequences. Our data suggests that in the Italian population actual differences in individual perception of the Covid-19 outbreak severity for health are dramatically modulated by psychosocial frailty (i.e., distress and loneliness). At the same time, problem-oriented coping strategies and enhanced empathic abilities increase people awareness about the severity of the impact of Covid-19 emergency on economics. There is an immediate need of consensus guidelines and healthcare policies to support interventions aimed to manage psychosocial distress and increase population resilience towards the imminent crisis.",Chiara Cerami et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46045-7E7-8F6,20200410,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2881,FALSE,,

"Changes in sleep pattern, sense of time, and digital media use during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Italy is one of the major COVID-19 hotspots. To reduce the spread of the infections and the pressure on Italian healthcare systems, since March 10th 2020, Italy is under a total lockdown, with restrictions on the movement of individuals in the entire nation, forcing people to home confinement. Here we present data from 1310 people living in the Italian territory (Mage= 23.91Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±3.60 years, 880 females, 501 workers, 809 University students), who completed an online survey from March 24th to March 28th 2020.

During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, spending more time in bed but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety, and stress symptomatology, and was associated with the feeling of time dilatation. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision-making, to build public awareness, and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions.",Nicola Cellini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46083-D4D-4E8,20200411,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2884,FALSE,,
The Psychological and Socio-political Consequences of Infectious Diseases,"What are the socio-political consequences of infectious diseases? Humans have evolved to avoid disease and infection, resulting in a set of psychological mechanisms that promote disease-avoidance, referred to as the behavioural immune system (BIS). One manifestation of the BIS is the cautious avoidance of unfamiliar, foreign, or potentially contaminating stimuli. Specifically, when disease infection risk is salient or prevalent, authoritarian attitudes can emerge that seek to avoid and reject foreign outgroups while favoring homogenous, familiar ingroups. In the largest study conducted on the topic to date (N>240,000), elevated regional levels of infectious pathogens were related to more authoritarian attitudes on three geographical levels: across US metropolitan regions, US states, and cross-culturally across 47 countries. The link between pathogen prevalence and authoritarian psychological dispositions predicted conservative voting behavior in the 2016 US Presidential Election as well as more authoritarian governance and state laws, in which one group of people imposes asymmetrical laws on others in a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, cross-cultural analysis illustrated that the relationship between infectious diseases and authoritarianism was pronounced for infectious diseases that can be acquired from other humans (nonzoonotic), and does not generalize to other infectious diseases that can only be acquired from non-human species (zoonotic diseases). At a time of heightened awareness of infectious diseases, these findings are important reminders that public health and ecology can have ramifications for socio-political attitudes, and this can shape how citizens vote as well as how they govern and are governed.",Leor Zmigrod et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617B-A99-70B,20200411,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2885,FALSE,,
Policing the Pandemic: Tracking the Policing of Covid-19 across Canada,"The Policing the Pandemic Mapping Project was launched on 4 April, 2020 to track and visualize these massive and extraordinary expansions of police power and the unequal patterns of enforcement they are likely to produce. In doing so, we hope that we can bring to light patterns of police intervention, to help understand who is being targeted, what justifications are being used by police, and how marginalized people are being impacted. More broadly, we hope the project will inform a larger conversation about the role of policing in society, to scrutinize public health and police collaboration, and to focus attention toward the harms of criminalization. Having an understanding of these patterns in coming weeks will help inform approaches to actively resist the logic and practices of policing crisis and disease, rather than allow them to become widespread and normalized. Through the acts of identifying, reporting, and visualizing events related to the policing of COVID-19, the project offers a living repository of publicly accessible data that can be used by activists, academics, journalists, and community members to analyze, discuss, and challenge the policing of disease. We encourage all people to use the data available through this project in any way they wish.",Alex Luscombe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D4-71F-6C0,20200412,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2886,FALSE,,
A review of infectious disease surveillance to inform public health action against the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic exposed the inadequacy of infectious disease surveillance throughout the US and other countries. Isolation and contact tracing to identify all infected people are key public health interventions necessary to control infectious disease outbreaks. However, these activities are dependent upon the surveillance platform to identify infections quickly. A robust surveillance platform can also reinforce community adherence to behavioral interventions such as social distancing. In situations where contact tracing is feasible, all suspected cases and contacts of confirmed cases must be tested for a SARS-CoV-2 infection and effectively isolated. At the community level wastewater surveillance can identify areas where transmission is or is not occurring, and genetic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 can help to elucidate the intensity of transmission independent of the number of known cases and hospitalizations. State and county public health departments should improve the infectious disease surveillance platform whilst the public is practicing social distancing. These enhanced surveillance activities are necessary to contain the epidemic once the curve has been sufficiently flattened in highly burdened areas, and to prevent escalation in areas where transmission is minimal.",David Larsen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D1-80A-E6D,20200412,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2887,FALSE,,
Logarithmic vs. Linear Visualizations of COVID-19 Cases Do Not Affect CitizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Support for Confinement,"In public health crises, the media and governments routinely share statistical analyses with the public. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the tool most commonly used to convey statistical information about the spread of the virus has been time-series graphs about the cumulative number of cases. When drawing such graphs, analysts have to make design decisions which can have dramatic effects on citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ interpretations. Plotting the COVID-19 progression on a linear scale highlights an exponential ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œexplosionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â in the number of cases, whereas plotting the number of cases on a logarithmic scale produces a line with a modest-looking slope. Even if the two graphs display the exact same information, differences in visual design may lead people to different substantive conclusions. In this study, we measure the causal effect of different visualization design choices on CanadiansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ views about the crisis. We report results from a survey experiment conducted in April 2020 with a sample of 2500 respondents.

Voting at the dawn of a global pandemic,"What is the impact of a global health crisis on political behavior? We study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on electoral choice based on the case of Germany, one of the countries most heavily affected by the crisis. Our data come from the German state of Bavaria, where local elections were held right at the beginning of the pandemic. The elections took place early during the outbreak when there was still substantial variation in the extent to which individual counties and municipalities were affected by the outbreak. This variation provides a unique opportunity to study the causal impact of an event that would shortly after grow into an all-encompassing epidemic. We provide evidence that shows that the disease spread across the state in a mostly haphazard fashion. This lack of a discernible pattern coupled with within-county estimation of effects and a difference-in-differences strategy allow us to causally asses the effect of the spreading of the virus on electoral outcomes. Our results show that the crisis strongly and consistently benefited the dominant regional party, the CSU, and its candidates. For 3 known cases per 100,000 inhabitants, vote shares increased by about 4 percent. We explain our findings with a strategic-alignment mechanism, whereby voters vote into power candidates that they deem most likely to be able to solicit support from higher levels of government. Our findings emphasize the merit of forward-looking theories of voting and provide insights on the functioning of democracy during times of crisis.",Arndt Leininger et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-D63-DCB,20200412,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2889,FALSE,,
CoronaNet: A Dyadic Dataset of Government Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads around the world, governments have implemented a broad set of policies to limit the spread of the pandemic. In this paper we present an initial release of a large hand-coded dataset of more than 4,500 separate policy announcements from governments around the world. This data is being made publicly available, in combination with other data that we have collected (including COVID-19 tests, cases, and deaths) as well as a number of country-level covariates. Due to the speed of the COVID-19 outbreak, we will be releasing this data on a daily basis with a 5-day lag for record validity checking. In a truly global effort, our team is comprised of more than 190 research assistants across 18 time zones and makes use of cloud-based managerial and data collection technology in addition to machine learning coding of news sources. We analyze the dataset with a Bayesian time-varying ideal point model showing the quick acceleration of more harsh policies across countries beginning in mid-March and continuing to the present. While some relatively low-cost policies like task forces and health monitoring began early, countries generally adopted more harsh measures within a narrow time window, suggesting strong policy diffusion effects.",Cindy Cheng et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46083-234-B25,20200412,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2890,FALSE,,
COVID-19 Knowledge and Perceptions in Nigeria,"This study assessed knowledge and perceptions about COVID-19 among the general public in Nigeria during the initial week of the pandemic lockdown in the country. From March 28 to April 4, 2020, this cross-sectional survey used an anonymous online questionnaire to collect data from respondents within Nigeria. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit 1357 respondents, aged 15-70 years, from 180 cities and towns within Nigeria. Study data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Approximately more than half (57.02%) of the respondents were male with high level of education (48.86% bachelorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s degree or higher). Approximately half of the respondents (46.94%) opined that COVID-19 was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa biological weapon designed by the Chinese government.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â About 94% of the respondents identified ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcontact with airborne droplets via breathing, sneezing, or coughingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â as the most common mode of transmission; most respondents associated COVID-19 with coughing (81.13%), shortness of breath (73.47%) and fever (62.79%). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRegular hand washing and social distancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â was selected by most respondents (94.25%) as a way of preventing infection whereas 11.86% reported ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconsuming gins, garlic, ginger, herbal mixtures and African foods/soupsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â as preventive measures against COVID-19. Majority of the respondents (91.73%) thought COVID-19 is deadly; and most respondents (84.3%) got 4 or more answers correctly. It was also observed that the traditional media (TV/Radio) are the most common source of health information about COVID-19 (93.5%). Findings revealed that Nigerians have relatively high knowledge, mostly derived from traditional media, about COVID-19.

Realistic expectations and pro-social behavioural intentions to the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Norwegian population,"The coronavirus pandemic represents a serious challenge for modern societies. How individuals perceive the risk influences their choice of action, and their collective actions determine the societal impact of the pandemic. We collected survey data (N = 4,083) from a representative sample of Norwegian citizens during the early phases of the pandemic (March 20-29, 2020). We found that most of the population considered the risk for being infected to be small and the risk for becoming seriously ill to be smaller still. On the other hand, most were worried that family members could be infected, and that their daily life could change drastically. Most were optimistic that they would handle the challenges of the virus, and that they would receive good medical treatment if they were to become sick. Almost all stated that they intended to follow the authoritiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ advice for limiting the contagion. Most stated that following the advice would be effective in preventing them from becoming sick and even more stated that it would prevent others from becoming sick.

Cross-sectional findings indicated elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms compared to historical norms, which were associated with COVID-19 concern more strongly than epidemiological data signifying objective risk. Employment loss was associated with greater depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern, and depressive symptoms and COVID-19 concern were significantly associated with more stringent self-quarantine behavior.

Results indicate that at the county-level, population and the proportion of Democrats were positively related to all measures of social distancing while the average education attainment was only positively related to travel-related social distancing. County vaccination rates, proportion of fair/poor health, and income inequality were positively related to reduction in non-essential visitations while unemployment rate was positively related to reduction in distance traveled. State-level neuroticism and cultural tightness were positively related to reduction in distance traveled and human encounters, but health and economic state variables yielded little to no effect across all county-level social distancing measures.

Do socio-economic indicators associate with COVID-2019 cases? Findings from a Philippine study,"Background: A wide spectrum of indicators has been postulated to associate with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-2019) cases. Among which were demographic profile, latitude, humidity, temperature, and ozone concentration. Despite obtaining significant results, there is still a dearth of research exploring other substantial determinants of Covid-2019 cases. The Philippine government is currently challenged to address issues pertaining to poverty and substinence. Empirical evidence of these studies suggests how identification of potential indicators could aid in the formulation of targeted strategies to mitigate future health problems. In this study, seven socio-economic indicators were associated with Covid-2019 cases across 17 regions in the Philippines. This is a retrospective study utilizing readily accessible public data in the analysis. Socio-economic indicators used were poverty incidence, magnitude of poor families, substinence incidence, and magnitude of substinence poor population. In addition, the income, expenditure, and savings recorded per Philippine region were taken for the analysis. A single Philippine region was the sampling unit; hence, a total of 17 regions were assessed. Covid-2019 cases as of April 7, 2020 were considered for the analysis. Descriptive statistics, Kendall rank correlation, and stepwise regression were used to determine if the seven socio-economic indicators were associated with Covid-2019 cases. Substinence incidence and income were retained for the regression model, which explained 87.2 percent of the variance in the Covid-2019 cases (R2 = .872). The results indicated that for every 1,000 PhP increase in income, there was a decrease of 3.99 Covid-2019 cases in each Philippine region. Meanwhile, for every 1.0 percent increase in substinence incidence, there was an increase of 3.34 Covid-2019 cases in each Philippine region. High income and low substinence incidence are associated with significant reductions in Covid-2019 cases across the 17 regions of the Philippines. This provides additional knowledge to policy makers and health officials in formulating targeted strategies to regions that could potentially record high number of Covid-2019 cases in the future. Early identification of these high-risk regions would warrant prompt preventive measures. Given the seasonal and recurring nature of Covid-2019 with respect to previous outbreaks, it is essential for the Philippine government to formulate directed policies and innovate programs that would decrease substinence and increase income. Concerted multi-region efforts should be made to prepare for possible infection outbreaks in the future. Additional studies could be explored in the future to capture significant changes in the socio-economic indicators.",Mark Alipio,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46003-5A2-9A7,20200414,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2899,FALSE,,

Moral values and trait pathogen disgust predict compliance with official recommendations regarding COVID-19 pandemic in US samples,"Emergency situations require individuals to make important changes in their behavior. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, official recommendations to slow the spread of the virus include costly behaviors such as self-quarantining, which individuals might be reluctant to adopt.

Design: An anonymous survey was distributed via community organization distribution lists to approximately 1250 constituents under a quarantine directive. Setting: Members of the first community in the NYC area under quarantine orders due to the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Intervention: We sought to uncover the most salient predictors of distress/anxiety in order to recommend specific areas for effective intervention to reduce distress Measures: We measured distress by using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale and anxiety with the Beck Anxiety Inventory. A variety of psychosocial predictors relevant to the current crisis were explored. Results: 303 individuals responded within 48 hours of survey distribution. Mean levels of distress in the sample were heightened and sustained, with 69% reporting moderate to severe distress. Modifiable behavioral factors, specifically with regard to media exposure and sleep quality, predicted the largest percentage of variance in the sample (41.9%, F (3, 264) = 40.7, R = 0.65, p < .001).

COVID-19_Insights from Innovation Economists,"The present document provides the take of innovation economists on the current pandemic. It is addressed to the general public and focuses on questions related to the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) ecosystem. It does not present new research findings. Instead, it provides a reading of current real-world developments using economic reasoning and relying on existing economic research. The first part of the report explains the root causes for a general underinvestment in Research and Development (R&D), with a particular focus on vaccines. These causes include an insufficient demand for vaccines in normal times and the very characteristics of R&D. Governments can intervene to mitigate these problems, but government intervention comes with its own set of issues. We discuss three of them, namely free riding, setting research priorities, and acting on scientific knowledge. The second part discusses several aspects related to current STI policy reactions. First, we observe a sizable shift of funds towards research on SARS-CoV-2. ArenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we wasting money by allocating so much of it on one single scientific problem? Using the concept of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“elasticity of science,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ we argue that we are far from a situation where additional funding would represent a waste of money. Second, we also observe an unprecedented level of cooperation among researchers but also an intense competition to find therapeutic solutions and vaccines. We seek to make sense of this apparent antonymy, highlighting how both cooperative and competitive forces might accelerate research. Third, we focus on one policy tool, namely patents, and we discuss whether the existence of patents hampers the search for a solution. We argue that it might, but we provide ways in which patents can be beneficial. They can accelerate research (such as through patent pools) or ensure greater access to innovations (such as with compulsory licensing). Fourth, we notice that the whole STI ecosystem has been rapidly refocusing on SARS-CoV-2 in a way similar to mission-oriented R&D (MOR) programs such as the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. We highlight the fundamental differences between MOR and the present situation. TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response is characterized by a proliferation of a wide range of innovative solutions offered by a complex set of institutions and actors with great intellectual freedom and decentralized competition. The third part of the report assesses some potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly discuss its impact on R&D investment. We explain how innovation might be negatively affected by a prolonged economic downturn and highlight the crucial role of stimulus packages in confronting the recession. We also address the influence of the crisis on ICT, arguing that it has been a formidable catalyst for ICT adoption. Next, we focus on clean technologies, another major societal challenge besides the pandemic. There are strong reasons for why cleantech investment may suffer. However, the crisis also offers significant opportunities to accelerate the green transition. Finally, we focus on open science, in particular on open access and open data. The current crisis could be a catalyst for the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Practices. The last part of the report offers some concluding thoughts. The STI policy response cannot be limited to the urgent need for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“technological fixes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ A second line of response involves the production of new knowledge to prevent outbreaks (ex-ante) or mitigate their effects (ex-post). Furthermore, the current crisis is a reminder that all branches of science matter. The pandemic has many facets, and a significant number of scientific disciplines can contribute to dealing with it. We conclude with a forward-looking note, arguing that the most substantial impact of the pandemic may lie outside of the public health realm or the science system. It offers a unique opportunity to adapt the set of rules that govern our society.",George Abi Younes et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46227-6FD-8C6,20200414,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2905,FALSE,,
Burnout Among Healthcare Providers During COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Evidence-based Interventions,"Burnout is a major occupational problem among healthcare providers. During coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the frontline health workforce is experiencing a high workload and multiple psychosocial stressors, which may affect their mental and emotional health, leading to burnout symptoms. Moreover, sleep deprivation and a critical lack of psychosocial support may aggravate such symptoms amidst COVID-19. Global evidence informs the need for adopting multipronged evidence-based approaches addressing burnout during this pandemic. Such interventions may include increasing the awareness of work-related stress and burnout, promoting mindfulness and self-care practices for promoting mental wellbeing, ensuring optimal mental health services, using digital technologies to address workplace stress and deliver mental health interventions, and improving organizational policies and practices emphasizing on addressing burnout among healthcare providers. As COVID-19 may impose unique workplace stress in addition to preexisting psychosocial burden among individuals, it is essential to prevent burnout through effective measures ensuring the mental and emotional wellbeing of healthcare providers globally.",Abida Sultana et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605C-A8F-1D8,20200414,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2906,FALSE,,
Towards a model of uncertainty distress in the context of Coronavirus (Covid-19),"The paper forms part of a series of two papers outlining the theoretical framework for a new model of uncertainty distress (paper one) as well as treatment implications (paper two) arising from the model. We define uncertainty distress as the subjective negative emotions experienced in response to the as yet unknown aspects of a given situation. In the first paper we drawn on a robust body of research on distinct areas including: threat models of anxiety, perceived illness uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty. We explore how threat and uncertainty are separable in anxiety and how we can understand behaviours in response to uncertainty. Finally, we propose a clinically, theoretically and empirically informed model for uncertainty distress and outline how this model can be tested. Clinical applications and practitioner key points are briefly included, however these are more fully outlined in our treatment implications (paper two). While we outline this model in the context of novel coronavirus (Covid-19), the model has broader applications to both mental and physical health care settings.",Mark H Freeston et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-8A9-622,20200414,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2907,FALSE,,
"Attitudes about COVID-19 in Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.A.: A novel test of political polarization and motivated reasoning","The COVID-19 pandemic has become more political in the U.S.A. than in similar Western countries, allowing for a novel test of attitude polarization. Furthermore, past work disagrees about the role of cognitive sophistication (relative to ideology) in the formation of science beliefs. We therefore investigated the roles of political ideology and cognitive sophistication in explaining COVID-19 attitudes across the U.S.A. (N=689), the U.K. (N=642), and Canada (N=644). Polarization was greater in the U.S. than in the U.K., but not Canada. Furthermore, in all three countries, cognitive sophistication correlated negatively with misperceptions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and in fact was a stronger predictor than political ideology. We also found no evidence that cognitive sophistication was associated with increased polarization, contrary to identity-protective cognition accounts of motivated reasoning. Thus, although there is some evidence for political polarization, accurate beliefs about COVID-19 were broadly associated with the quality of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reasoning regardless of political polarization.",Gordon Pennycook et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46218-330-6AB,20200414,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2908,FALSE,,

Health-related beliefs included: the anti-vaccination attitudes, conspiracy beliefs related to the COVID-19 disease, and some generic epistemically suspect beliefs related to health. Scientific reasoning predicted generic pseudoscientific and conspiracy beliefs related to health and also conspiracy beliefs related specifically to COVID-19. Crucially, scientific reasoning was a stronger independent predictor of unfounded beliefs (including anti-vaccination attitudes) than general analytic thinking, however, its role in the health-related behaviors was more modest.",Vladimira Cavojova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FB-508-5E9,20200415,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2909,FALSE,,

Psychological symptoms of the outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis and confinement in the population of Spain,"Background: The outbreak and spread of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led to a confinement situation in many countries worldwide. Our objective was to analyze the short-term psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis and the quarantine on the population. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A survey was completed by 3550 adults from Spain. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress were analyzed using the 21-item version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder were analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. Results: Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression, stress were observed in 32.4%, 44.1% and 37.0% of respondents, respectively. Also, symptomatic scores indicating psychological stress were found in 88.6% of respondents. Increased prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms was associated with female sex, younger age, self-reported COVID-19 symptoms, previous psychological or psychiatric treatment, intake of psychoactive medication and negative effect on social relationships and relationships with people living in the same place. Higher scores related to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with most of those factors, and also with the acquaintance with a COVID-19 patient. Conclusion: An important emotional impact of confinement related to COVID-19 has been found in Spanish population. Considering a possible long period of confinement, the evolution of the psychological effects should be controlled to prevent severe mental health disorders.",Paula Odriozola-GonzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lez et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A5-921-9FF,20200415,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2911,FALSE,,
Emotional responses to prosocial messages increase willingness to self-isolate during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic may be one of the greatest modern societal challenges that requires widespread collective action and cooperation. While a handful of actions can help reduce pathogen transmission, one critical behavior is to self-isolate. Public health messages often use persuasive language to change attitudes and behaviors, which can evoke a wide range of negative and positive emotional responses. In a U.S. representative sample (N = 955), we presented two messages that leveraged either threatening or prosocial persuasive language, and measured self-reported emotional reactions and willingness to self-isolate. While results show that both types of appeals increased willingness to self-isolate (CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s d = .41), compared to the threat message, the efficacy of the prosocial message was more dependent on the magnitude of the evoked emotional response on both arousal and valence dimensions.

Furthermore, we tested if an intervention, affirmation of these psychological needs, counteracts this negative impact. Results of Study 1 (N = 153) showed that higher levels of satisfaction of basic psychological needs was related to higher mental well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. In Study 2 (N = 215) we employed an online intervention enhancing these basic psychological needs. We found increased mental well-being through bolstered relatedness in particular. The intervention also decreased perceived stress.

Perceptions of an Insufficient Government Response at the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic are Associated with Lower Mental Well-Being,"We conducted a large-scale survey covering 58 countries and over 100,000 respondents at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âbetween March 20 and April 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âto explore how beliefs about citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to the COVID-19 pandemic affected mental well-being. Our analyses reveal three findings. First, many respondents indicate that their countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s citizens and governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response was insufficient. Second, respondentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perception of an insufficient public and government response and handling is associated with lower mental well-being.

Measuring Identity Orientations for Understanding Economic Preferences: A French Validation of the Aspects-of-Identity Questionnaire.,"Concepts and results from the psychological research on identity may provide better understanding of the formation and dynamics of economic preferences. In this perspective, we propose a French translation of the Aspect of Identity (AIQ-IV) psychometric questionnaire, which measures the orientation of subjective identity along personal, relational, public, and collective dimensions (Cheek and Briggs 1982, 2013). The psychometric validation study checks the internal consistency, as well as the four-dimensional factorial structure, of the questionnaire in a representative sample of French young adults (N=1,118). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of item responses reveal a four-factor structure that corresponds to the personal, relational, public, and collective aspects of identity. Individual responses are found to be stable over time. In addition, while being moderately correlated with related psychological constructs (Self-esteem, Social Self-esteem, Self-consciousness), dimensions of the AIQ also predicts risk, time, and social preferences as measured by Likert scales and hypothetical choices.

Correlates of Health-Protective Behavior During the Initial Days of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Norway,"The coronavirus outbreak manifested in Norway in March 2020. It was met with a combination of mandatory changes (closing of public institutions) and recommended changes (hygiene behavior, physical distancing). It has been emphasized that health-protective behavior such as increased hygiene or physical distancing are able to slow the spread of infections and flatten the curve. Drawing on previous health-psychological studies during the outbreak of various pandemics, we investigated psychological and demographic factors predicting the adoption and engagement in health-protective behavior and changes in such behavior, attitudes, and emotions over time. We recruited a non-representative sample of Norwegians (n = 8676) during a 15-day period (March 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“26 2020) at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Norway. Employing both traditional methods and exploratory machine learning, we replicated earlier findings that engagement in health-protective behavior is associated with specific demographic characteristics. Further, we observed that increased media exposure, perceiving measures as effective, and perceiving the outbreak as serious positively was related to engagement in health-protective behavior. We also found indications that hygiene and physical distancing behaviors were related to somewhat different psychological and demographic factors. Over the sampling period, reported engagement in physical distancing increased, while experienced concern or fear declined. Contrary to previous studies, we found no or only small positive predictions by confidence in authorities, knowledge about the outbreak, and perceived individual risk, while all of those variables were rather high. These findings provide guidance for health communications or interventions targeting the adoption of health-protective behaviors in order to diminish the spread of COVID-19.",Janis Zickfeld et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F1-53D-F01,20200416,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2916,FALSE,,

OBJECTIVE/METHOD: This study sought to identify demographic and psychosocial factors associated with concern about COVID-19 and engagement in preventative health behaviors suggested to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 (social distancing, handwashing, cleaning/disinfecting, avoiding touching face, and wearing facemasks). From March 20 to 23, 2020, a US national sample (N=1019) completed an online survey.

"A global test of message framing on behavioural intentions, policy support, information seeking, and experienced anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents a critical need to identify best practices for communicating health information to the global public. It also provides an opportunity to test theories about risk communication. As part of a larger Psychological Science Accelerator COVID-19 Rapid Project, a global consortium of researchers will experimentally test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of framing messages in terms of losses versus gains. We will examine effects on three primary outcomes: intentions to adhere to policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, opinions about such policies, and the likelihood that participants seek additional policy information. Whereas research on negativity bias and loss aversion predicts that loss-framing will have greater impact, research on encouraging the adoption of protective health behaviour suggests the opposite (i.e., gain-framing will be more persuasive). We will also assess effects on experienced anxiety. Given the potentially low cost and the scalable nature of framing interventions, results could be valuable to health organizations, policymakers, and news sources globally.",Charles Dorison et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FF-C67-BE1,20200416,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2919,FALSE,,
"Knowledge, perception and attitudes in Regard to COVID-19 Pandemic in Peruvian Population","ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Latin American countries have been profoundly affected by COVID-19. Due to the alarming incidence of identified cases, we intended to explore which psycho-social elements may be influencing the poor adherence toward the mandatory control measures among the population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and vulnerability perception of Peruvians during the coronavirus outbreak. METHOD: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 225 self-selected participants, evaluating demographic information. The overall respondents were between 18 and 29 years old (56.8%), being female (n = 134), belonging to educated groups, and graduated professionals (69.3%), the majority of them. RESULTS: Logistic regression showed that knowledge is highly correlated with education (p=0.031), occupation (p=0.002), and age (p= 0.016). Our study identified that, although people reported adequate knowledge by identifying expected symptoms and virus transmission ways in COVID-19 disease. There is a significant perceived susceptibility to contract the mentioning virus, displaying stigmatized behavior (59.1%) and fear of contracting the virus from others (70.2%). Additionally, it is reported to lack people's confidence to health national authorities on the sanitary responses (62.7%), preparedness for the disease (76.9%) and the lack of adequate measures to deal with it (51.1%).

To reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions, we will examine the impact of reappraisal, a widely studied and highly effective form of emotion regulation. Participants from 55 countries (expected N = 25,448) will be randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing), an active control condition, or a passive control condition. We predict that both reappraisal interventions will reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions relative to the control conditions.

High boredom proneness and low trait self-control impair adherence to social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Social distancing during the coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is crucial to reduce the spread of the virus. However, its effectiveness hinges on adherence by individuals who face substantial burdens from the required behavioral restrictions. Here, we investigate sources of individual variation in adhering to social distancing guidelines. In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence.

How Right-Leaning Media Coverage of COVID-19 Facilitated the Spread of Misinformation in the Early Stages of the Pandemic,"In recent weeks, several academic and journalistic outlets have documented widespread misinformation about the origins and potential treatment for COVID-19. This misinformation could have important public health consequences if misinformed people are less likely to heed the advice of public health experts. While some have anecdotally tied the prevalence of misinformation to misleading or inaccurate media coverage of the pandemic in its early stages, few have rigorously tested this claim empirically. In this paper, we report the results of an automated content analysis showing that right-leaning news outlets (e.g., Fox News, Breitbart) were more than 2.5 times more likely than mainstream outlets to discuss COVID-19 misinformation during the early stages of the U.S. pandemic response. In a nationally representative survey (N = 8,914) conducted from 3/10-3/16, we then show that people who consumed more right-leaning news during this timeframe were more than twice as likely to endorse COVID-related misinformation. Alarmingly, survey data further suggest that misinformation endorsement has negative public health consequences, as misinformed people are more likely to believe that the CDC is exaggerating COVID-related health risks.",Matthew Motta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-7FF-B3D,20200418,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2924,FALSE,,
Prospect Theory in Times of a Pandemic: The Effects of Gain versus Loss Framing on Policy Preferences and Emotional Responses During the 2020 Coronavirus Outbreak,"During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, citizens and governments across the globe relied heavily on the legacy media: Not only to inform people about fast-paced developments in the midst of a crisis, but also to stimulate compliance with strict interventions. Prospect theory postulates that gain versus loss framing may affect preferences for different interventions. In a conceptual replication of Tversky and KahnemanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seminal prospect theory, findings from surveys in the US and the Netherlands (N = 1,121) demonstrate that gain frames of the coronavirus promote support for risk-aversive interventions, whereas loss frames result in more support for risk-seeking alternatives. Beyond these preferences, gain frames yield slightly more support for strict interventions such as a lockdown than loss frames. Loss frames elicit stronger negative emotions, such as frustration and powerlessness. The experience of powerlessness, in turn, mediates the effects of loss versus gain frames on support for stricter interventions. Together, these findings indicate that framing the pandemic in terms of gains may be most effective in promoting support for the strict preventative measures that have been taken throughout the globe.",Michael Hameleers,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F3-9C8-C38,20200418,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2925,FALSE,,
"Anxiety, Depression, Traumatic Stress, and COVID-19 Related Anxiety in the UK General Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented global crisis necessitating drastic changes to living conditions, social life, personal freedom and economic activity. No study has yet examined the presence of psychiatric symptoms in the UK population in similar conditions. Aims We investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 related anxiety, generalised anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms in a representative sample of the UK population during an early phase of the pandemic, and estimated associations with variables likely to influence these symptoms. Method Between March 23rd and March 28th 2020, a quota sample of 2025 UK adults 18 years and older, stratified by age, sex and household income, was recruited by online survey company Qualtrics. Participants completed measures of depression (PHQ9), generalised anxiety (GAD7), and trauma symptoms relating to the pandemic (ITQ). Bivariate and multivariate associations were calculated for age, gender, rural vs urban environment, presence of children in the household, income, loss of income, pre-existing health conditions in self and someone close, infection in self and someone close, and perceived risk of infection over the next month. Results Higher levels of anxiety, depression and trauma symptoms were reported compared to previous population studies, but not dramatically so. Meeting the criteria for either anxiety or depression, and trauma symptoms was predicted by young age, presence of children in the home, and high estimates of personal risk. Anxiety and depression symptoms were also predicted by low income, loss of income, and pre-existing health conditions in self and other. Specific anxiety about COVID-19 was greater in older participants. Conclusions The UK population, especially older citizens, were largely resilient in the early stages of the pandemic. However, several specific COVID-related variables are associated with psychological distress: particularly having children at home, loss of income because of the pandemic, as well as having a pre-existing health condition, exposure to the virus and high estimates of personal risk. Further similar surveys, particularly of those with children at home, are required as the pandemic progresses.",Mark Shevlin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CD-FAF-3F5,20200418,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2926,FALSE,,
The COVID-19 pandemic in an aging world,"Since death rates from the COVID-19 are highest among the oldest, the impact of the current pandemic in a given society depends to a large extent on the share of elderly persons and their living arrangements. Whereas the former is well known, the latter is not. Arguably, contagion itself and the severity of its symptoms are likely to vary among elderly persons living alone, co-residing with family members or dwelling in institutions. Arguments in favour and against the premise that single-living elderly are better able to self-isolate can be made. Long-term care facilities have worsened the effects of the epidemic because they have often become death traps in some but not all countries. Once contagion takes place, living arrangements can make a huge difference in the way the disease can be managed by the individual, his family and society. Properly understanding the dynamics of contagion and the handling of the disease in terms of living arrangements of elderly people is essential for effectively tackling future outbreaks of similar epidemics.",David S.

COVID-19: Insights from Innovation Economists (with French executive summary),"The present document provides the take of innovation economists on the current pandemic. It is addressed to the general public and focuses on questions related to the Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) ecosystem. It does not present new research findings. Instead, it provides a reading of current real-world developments using economic reasoning and relying on existing economic research. The first part of the report explains the root causes for a general underinvestment in Research and Development (R&D), with a particular focus on vaccines. These causes include an insufficient demand for vaccines in normal times and the very characteristics of R&D. Governments can intervene to mitigate these problems, but government intervention comes with its own set of issues. We discuss three of them, namely free riding, setting research priorities, and acting on scientific knowledge. The second part discusses several aspects related to current STI policy reactions. First, we observe a sizable shift of funds towards research on SARS-CoV-2. ArenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t we wasting money by allocating so much of it on one single scientific problem? Using the concept of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“elasticity of science,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ we argue that we are far from a situation where additional funding would represent a waste of money. Second, we also observe an unprecedented level of cooperation among researchers but also an intense competition to find therapeutic solutions and vaccines. We seek to make sense of this apparent antonymy, highlighting how both cooperative and competitive forces might accelerate research. Third, we focus on one policy tool, namely patents, and we discuss whether the existence of patents hampers the search for a solution. We argue that it might, but we provide ways in which patents can be beneficial. They can accelerate research (such as through patent pools) or ensure greater access to innovations (such as with compulsory licensing). Fourth, we notice that the whole STI ecosystem has been rapidly refocusing on SARS-CoV-2 in a way similar to mission-oriented R&D (MOR) programs such as the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. We highlight the fundamental differences between MOR and the present situation. TodayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response is characterized by a proliferation of a wide range of innovative solutions offered by a complex set of institutions and actors with great intellectual freedom and decentralized competition. The third part of the report assesses some potential long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We firstly discuss its impact on R&D investment. We explain how innovation might be negatively affected by a prolonged economic downturn and highlight the crucial role of stimulus packages in confronting the recession. We also address the influence of the crisis on ICT, arguing that it has been a formidable catalyst for ICT adoption. Next, we focus on clean technologies, another major societal challenge besides the pandemic. There are strong reasons for why cleantech investment may suffer. However, the crisis also offers significant opportunities to accelerate the green transition. Finally, we focus on open science, in particular on open access and open data. The current crisis could be a catalyst for the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) Data Practices. The last part of the report offers some concluding thoughts. The STI policy response cannot be limited to the urgent need for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“technological fixes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ A second line of response involves the production of new knowledge to prevent outbreaks (ex-ante) or mitigate their effects (ex-post). Furthermore, the current crisis is a reminder that all branches of science matter. The pandemic has many facets, and a significant number of scientific disciplines can contribute to dealing with it. We conclude with a forward-looking note, arguing that the most substantial impact of the pandemic may lie outside of the public health realm or the science system. It offers a unique opportunity to adapt the set of rules that govern our society.",George Abi Younes et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46073-6E9-C5D,20200418,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2928,FALSE,,
The COVID-19 pandemic is changing the way people recreate outdoors: Preliminary report on a national survey of outdoor enthusiasts amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"On March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The pandemic is rapidly altering daily life and leading to changes in the way we spend time outside. In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns, before, during, and after the pandemic, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics worked quickly with its academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, to offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the country. In total, 1,012 outdoor recreationists were surveyed through the Leave No Trace community in a 48-hour window beginning on the morning of April 9th. Our hope is that the results of this rapid assessment will provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world. The following tables, figures, and corresponding brief descriptions are intended to provide initial results of this research effort. Further results are forthcoming.",William L.

Immediate psychological effects of the COVID-19 quarantine in youth from Italy and Spain,"The present study aims to examine for the first time the emotional impact of the quarantine on children and adolescents from Italy and Spain, two of the most affected countries by COVID-19. 1,143 parents of Italian and Spanish children aged 3 to 18 years completed a survey providing information about how the quarantine affects their children and themselves, compared to before the home confinement. 85.7% of the parents perceived changes in their childrenÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine. The most frequent symptoms were difficulty concentrating (76.6%), boredom (52%), irritability (39%), restlessness (38.8%), nervousness (38%), feelings of loneliness (31.3%), uneasiness (30.4%), and worries (30.1%), and Spanish parents reported more symptoms than Italians. As expected, children of both countries used monitors more frequently, spent less time doing physical activity, and slept more hours during the quarantine. Furthermore, when family coexistence during quarantine became more difficult, the situation was more serious, and the level of stress was higher, parents tended to report more emotional problems in their children.

The Global Response to COVID-19 as an Example of a One-Sided Problem Definition in the Absence of General Collective Intelligence,"Problem definitions are defined here as one-sided in the case that while they might take into account one class of negative outcomes, such as those associated with the problem, at the same time they might ignore other classes of negative outcomes, such as those that may be encountered while implementing interventions that try to avoid the problem. An example is amputating all limbs with potentially cancerous moles on them to reduce the risk of mortality due to cancer as much as possible, without considering the increase in mortality due to the amputations. The global response to COVID-19 has been characterized by the availability of mathematical models for the potential mortality due to the spread of the pandemic. However in some cases the researchers guiding the responses of their respective nations with their mathematical models have explicitly pointed out that corresponding mathematical models of the impacts of economic shutdowns or other potential interventions on mortality have not been incorporated, and that there is a critical need to include such models. This paper generalizes this problem of one-sided problem definitions past the COVID-19 response to a wide variety of group problems where the pattern of one-sidedness applies, and explores how in current group decision-making systems one-sided problem definitions might consistently tend to be exploited in a way that is detrimental to collective well-being, as well as how a system of group decision-making meeting the requirements of a General Collective Intelligence solves the problem of one-sidedness to reliably maximize collective well-being.",Andy E Williams,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46061-621-C0E,20200420,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2931,FALSE,,
A Contextual Planning Tool for Self-Caring Behaviors,"The factors that influence self-caring behaviors vary greatly based on contextual variables for the organism.

Transforming Economies and Generating Sustainable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â Economic Growth After the COVID-19 Pandemic through General Collective Intelligence,"The lockdown of economic activity in many countries as a measure to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of unemployment and other indicators of a potentially upcoming economic crisis. As a gauge of the seriousness of these concerns some have suggested that current levels of some of these indicators have not been seen in the US since the time of the great depression. This paper explores how General Collective Intelligence, a recent innovation in group decision-making systems, might reliably generate the economic growth needed to avert such a crisis where not reliably achievable otherwise. Current group decision-making systems, whether choosing a human decision-maker, consensus voting on decisions, or automated decision-systems such as conventional collective intelligence, have been suggested to lack the capacity to maximize more than a very few group outcomes simultaneously due to specific limitations. Since impact on collective well-being is determined by impact on an open (unbounded) set of outcomes, this implies lack of the capacity to maximize the necessary range of impacts on well-being for groups if that range is too broad. If so, the breadth of impact required to achieve sustainable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â economic development while simultaneously solving hunger, solving the environmental degradation that consensus has linked to climate change, as well as providing maximal access to healthcare, education, and other resources, may not be reliably possible with current decision systems. General Collective Intelligence or GCI replicates the adaptive problem solving mechanisms by which nature has demonstrated the ability to optimally respond to an unlimited set of problems, and by which nature has demonstrated the ability to potentially increase sustainability per unit of resources by orders of magnitude so that life is reliably self-sustaining. This paper explores why GCI can potentially be used to reliably drive self-sustaining economic growth to revive economies in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and why GCI has the potential to reliably drive a transformation to sustainable green economies while doing so.",Andy E Williams,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B0-152-963,20200420,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2933,FALSE,,
The effects of social deprivation on adolescent social development and mental health,"Adolescence is a period of life characterized by heightened sensitivity to social stimuli and the increased need for peer interaction. The physical distancing measures mandated globally to contain the spread of Covid-19 are radically reducing adolescentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ opportunities to engage in face-to-face social contact outside their household. In this interdisciplinary review, we describe recent literature from a variety of domains that highlights how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have demonstrated the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies like social media. The findings reviewed highlight how physical distancing might have a disproportionate impact on an age group for whom peer interaction is a vital aspect of development.",Amy Orben et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F7-829-28C,20200420,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2934,FALSE,,
"Maslow, Meaning and Data: Applying interdisciplinary approaches to evaluating a personalised youth employment programme","This research aimed to uncover barriers to unemployment faced by young people who are furthest from the labour market. It arises from a research project, ENLIVEN ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Encouraging Lifelong Learning for an Inclusive and Vibrant Europe (2016-2019), funded by the European UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Horizon 2020 programme, which focuses on interdisciplinary approaches to influencing policy formation. An evaluation of a local employment support service for young people unemployed for 12 months or more was undertaken by computer and social scientists within ENLIVEN. Two data mining approaches were utilised: proximity to the labour market indicator analysis and decision tree analysis of programme participant employment outcomes. An important question considered was whether the decision tree analysis would support anecdotal experience from local practitioners which indicated the relevance of MaslowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hierarchy of needs to their work within the context of the most vulnerable young people. It was found by decision tree analysis that young people who possess good levels of confidence, mental health and who have worked before are more likely to secure a sustained employment outcome.

Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses,"Objective: Dating violence (DV) is a psychosocial problem which impacts the health and wellbeing of affected individuals. Many studies have reported a high prevalence and various determinants of DV; however, there is a gap of consolidated evidence on this problem. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of DV from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methods: We systematically searched ten major databases and additional sources to retrieve systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting prevalence or determinants of DV, published as peer-reviewed journal articles in English language till October 13, 2019. We extracted and synthesized the findings, reported the prevalence of DV, and categorized the determinants of DV using the socioecological model. Results: We found 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Most of these studies were conducted in developed countries with a majority of adolescent and young adult participants. Studies reported varying prevalence of physical, sexual, psychological/emotional, and technology-assisted DV ranging from 0.1% to 57.5%, 0.1% to 64.6%, 4.2% to 97%, and 5.8% to 92%, respectively. The determinants of DV at different socioecological levels, including individual behavior, substance abuse, psychiatric conditions, experiencing violence and maltreatment; interpersonal factors like family and peer relationships; community and neighborhood characteristics; patriarchy, culture, and socioeconomic equalities were reported. Conclusions: These findings suggest a high burden of DV among young populations, who are vulnerable to various socioecological determinants of DV. Future research should examine how these factors influence DV and multi-level interventions should be adopted to address the same.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46239-047-C68,20200420,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2936,FALSE,,

"Capability, opportunity and motivation to enact hygienic practices in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK","Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global health threats facing humanity in recent memory. This study aimed to explore influences on hygienic practices, a set of key transmission behaviours, in relation to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change (Michie et al., 2011). Design Data from the first wave of a longitudinal survey study was used, launched in the early stages of the UK COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants were 2025 adults aged 18 and older, representative of the UK population, recruited by a survey company from a panel of research participants. Participants self-reported motivation, capability and opportunity to enact hygienic practices during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results Using regression models, we found that all three COM-B components significantly predicted good hygienic practices, with motivation having the greatest influence on behaviour. Breaking this down further, the sub-scales psychological capability, social opportunity and reflective motivation positively influenced behaviour. Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores. Conclusions Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices. Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID-19 transmission. Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.",Jilly Gibson Miller et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C7-453-F6D,20200420,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2938,FALSE,,

"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic and Nationwide Lockdown on Trust, Attitudes towards Government, and Wellbeing","The contagiousness and deadliness of COVID-19 have necessitated drastic social management to halt transmission. The immediate effects of a nationwide lockdown were investigated by comparing matched samples of New Zealanders assessed before (Npre-lockdown = 1,003) and during the first 18 days of lockdown (Nlockdown = 1,003). Two categories of outcomes were examined: (1) institutional trust and attitudes towards the nation and government, and (2) health and wellbeing. Applying propensity score matching to approximate the conditions of a randomized controlled experiment, the study found that people in the pandemic/lockdown group reported higher trust in science, politicians, and police, higher levels of patriotism, and higher rates of mental distress compared to people in the pre-lockdown pre-pandemic group.

Fake news in the time of environmental disaster: Preparing framework for COVID-19,"The increasing trend of environmental disaster due to changing climate has escalated the occurrence of Tsunami, Forest fire, Flood, Epidemics and other extreme health and environmental and hazardous events across the globe. Establishment of effective and transparent communication during the crisis phase is extremely important to reduce the after-effects of the events. In recent times, fake news or news with fabricated content have emerged as major threats of communications during and and post -disaster phase. The present study critically evaluates the nature and consequences of fake news spread during the four major environmental disasters in recent era (Fukushima Nuclear Disaster, Keralan Flood, Amazon Forest Fire and African Ebola Epidemic) and prepared a framework for present COVID-19 Pandemic. The criticality and potential threat created by the fake news have been quantified and analyzed through the timeline of news spreading. It has been observed that the adverse impact related to the African Ebola Epidemic was highest due to its multiple fake news origin sites, both online and offline propagation methods, well fabricated content and relatively low effort on containment. However the COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing disaster expected to have a long- drawn impact covering most countries in the world with combined consequences hence it tends to overtake all other events. Policy recommendations have been prepared to combat the spreading of fake news during the present and future environmental disasters. The importance of the study relies on the fact that the number of environmental disasters will increase in future and strategy for risk communication during the time is still not explored adequately. In addition the study will contribute significantly for understanding the present status of information paradigm for COVID-19 and helps in preparing region-specific real-time contingency measures for effective risk communication.",Syeda Saadia Azim et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EE-FB7-4F9,20200421,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2942,FALSE,,
CHILDREN ENDORSE DETERRENCE MOTIVATIONS FOR THIRD-PARTY PUNISHMENT BUT DERIVE HIGHER ENJOYMENT FROM COMPENSATING VICTIMS,"It is unknown whether children enjoy punishing transgressors and whether they are motivated by retribution, as adults frequently are. ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approaches to compensation of victims have been little studied. British, Colombian and Italian 7- to 11-year-old children (N = 123) operated a Justice System in which they viewed different moral transgressions in Minecraft, a globally popular videogame, either face-to-face with an experimenter or over the internet. Children could respond to transgressions by punishing transgressors and compensating victims. The purpose of the system was framed in three ways (between-subject): retribution; deterrence; or compensation. We measured childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s punitive and compensatory tendencies, their enjoyment of punishment and compensation, and their endorsement of retribution vs deterrence as punishment justifications, during and/or after justice administration. Children overwhelmingly endorsed deterrence over retribution as their punishment justification, irrespective of age, country and frame. When asked to reproduce the presented frame, children more reliably reproduced the deterrence than retribution frame. Punishment enjoyment decreased while compensation enjoyment increased over time. Despite enjoying compensation more, children preferentially endorsed punishment over compensation, especially with increasing age (after justice administration) and increasing transgression severity (during justice administration). Reported deterrent justifications, superior reproduction of deterrence framing, lower enjoyment of punishment compared to compensation, and higher endorsement of punishment over compensation together suggest that childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s punishment behaviour is primarily motivated by deterrence and sense of duty. Face-to-face and internet-mediated responses were not distinguishable, suggesting a route to social psychology research with primary school-aged children in times of social distancing.",Rhea Luana Arini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-871-F29,20200421,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2943,FALSE,,

Supporting Families with Children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities During COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on how people go about their day to day life. The sudden change, along with necessary measures such as self-isolation and social distancing has been particularly challenging for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SENDs) and their families, given their reliance on many on carefully established routines and relationships as well as professional and informal support. Three hundred and thirty nine parents of children with SENDs (the majority with Autism Spectrum Conditions) completed an online survey during the first two months of the social distancing in the UK (23rd March 2020 - 22nd May 2020). Parents provided detailed accounts of their familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s needs both to support their child during lockdown and to transition back to school. Many of these support needs during lockdown were either unique to families of children with SENDs or represented a more profound challenge than in most neurotypical families. There were considerable differences in satisfaction with support during COVID-19 suggesting wide variation in support provided to families of children with SENDs. The findings also suggest that educators and policy makers should place the implementation of clear routines and targeted mental health support at the centre of any strategy designed to support children with SENDs in making the transition back to school. The study provides preliminary insights into parental perspectives on support during the COVID-19 pandemic for families with children with SENDs.",Umar Toseeb et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601B-57C-66B,20200421,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2945,FALSE,,

This paper proposes two neural network architectures for modeling unsupervised lexical learning from raw acoustic inputs, ciwGAN (Categorical InfoWaveGAN) and fiwGAN (Featural InfoWaveGAN), that combine a Deep Convolutional GAN architecture for audio data (WaveGAN; Donahue et al. 2019) with an information theoretic extension of GAN ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ InfoGAN (Chen et al., 2016), and propose a new latent space structure that can model featural learning simultaneously with a higher level classification. In addition to the Generator and the Discriminator networks, the architectures introduce a network that learns to retrieve latent codes from generated audio outputs. Lexical learning is thus modeled as emergent from an architecture that forces a deep neural network to output data such that unique information is retrievable from its acoustic outputs. The networks trained on lexical items from TIMIT learn to encode unique information corresponding to lexical items in the form of categorical variables in their latent space. By manipulating these variables, the network outputs specific lexical items. The network occasionally outputs innovative lexical items that violate training data, but are linguistically interpretable and highly informative for cognitive modeling and neural network interpretability. Innovative outputs suggest that phonetic and phonological representations learned by the network can be productively recombined and directly paralleled to productivity in human speech: a fiwGAN network trained on suit and dark outputs innovative start, even though it never saw start or even a [st] sequence in the training data. We also argue that setting latent featural codes to values well beyond training range results in almost categorical generation of prototypical lexical items and reveals underlying values of each latent code. Probing deep neural networks trained on well understood dependencies in speech bear implications for latent space interpretability, understanding how deep neural networks learn meaningful representations, as well as a potential for unsupervised text-to-speech generation in the GAN framework.",Gasper Begus,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-E3A-5F9,20200421,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2948,FALSE,,
"Factors Associated With Concern, Behaviour & Policy Support in Response to SARS-CoV-2","SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that results in a disease known as COVID-19. Given that no vaccine is currently available, or likely to be available in the near term, slowing the spread of the virus relies on radical behaviour change at a mass scale. Understanding the factors associated with behaviour change and support for different policy measures is therefore critical. Here, we present data collected in two waves in the UK and the USA (March 12th and 24th) exploring (i) subjective concern about the health impacts of COVID-19 for self, for family and for society; (ii) the factors associated with compliance with several preventive behavioural measures; and (iii) support for policy measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Concern about the societal impacts of COVID-19 varied along partisan lines, with political conservatives being relatively less concerned than political liberals about the impacts for society. People who reported being more concerned also reported adopting more preventive behaviours and supported a greater number of policies. Concern for self and family was a stronger predictor than societal concern for behaviour change and policy support, and most strongly predicted the increase in both these measures from March 12th to 24th. Political conservatives in both countries supported fewer policies, an effect that could be partially mediated by the negative effect of political conservatism on societal concern. These findings suggest concern for self and family outweighs concern for society in motivating behaviour change needed to curb the spread of COVID-19, and that concern for society varies along political lines.",Nichola Raihani et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-7D8-B4F,20200421,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2949,FALSE,,
A Tale of Two Crises: Financial Fragility and Beliefs about the Spread of COVID-19,"Experts estimate that there could be millions of cases of COVID-19 in the US, leading to potentially 100,000 or more deaths. Beliefs about the severity of the spread of COVID-19 and one's own likelihood of being infected have implications for individual behavior and consequently for the spread of the virus. The current research explores key factors that enter into these beliefs. Using nationally representative surveys with more than 3,800 participants, we find that key factors epidemiological models typically use in their predictions (e.g., concentration of cases in a given area) do not meaningfully enter into individuals' beliefs. We draw on the reality that we currently face not only a health crisis, but a financial crisis as well to identify financial fragility as a key factor influencing beliefs.",Jennifer Trueblood et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46208-8CE-3B2,20200421,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2950,FALSE,,
Comparing In-Person Supervision and Telesupervision: A Multiple Baseline Single-Case Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated the unplanned, widespread adoption of telepsychotherapy by mental health care professionals. Psychotherapy supervision is also undergoing a rapid shift to telepractice, though questions remain about the efficacy and regulatory standing of telesupervision. A critical unanswered question is: How does telesupervision compare to traditional in-person supervision? This study (completed before the COVID-19 pandemic) used a multiple baseline single-case design to compare the relative effectiveness of in-person supervision and telesupervision. For the small sample of supervisee participants, in-person supervision and telesupervision had equivalent outcomes; there was no significant decrease in participant-rated supervision satisfaction or supervisory working alliance after participants switched from the initial in-person supervision format to telesupervision. In follow-up interviews, participants discussed four themes which may be relevant to mental health care professionals adopting telesupervision: (a) differences between modalities, (b) characteristics of an effective supervisor, (c) the role of technology, and (d) personal preference. These results add to a small but growing evidence base that suggests telesupervision is a viable alternative to in-person supervision. Practical recommendations for telesupervision during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.",Kevin Tarlow et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-0FB-06A,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2951,FALSE,,
Anxiety and depression in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland precipitated the temporary closure of all non-essential services and a nationwide quarantine as of March 27th, 2020. This study represents the first assessment of the mental health of the nation during the initial phase of the COVID-19 response, as part of a multi-wave investigation into the social, behavioural, and psychological impact of the pandemic. Aims: First, estimate prevalence rates of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and combined anxiety and depression, and identify risk factors associated with screening positive for anxiety/depression. Second, determine if COVID-19-related anxiety was highest amongst those identified with the greatest mortality risk from the virus. Method: Self-report data from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1,041) was collected online between March 31 and April 5; the first week of the Republic of IrelandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nationwide quarantine measures. Results: A substantial proportion of people screened positive for depression (22.77%), generalized anxiety (20.00%), and anxiety/depression (27.67%). Screening positive for anxiety/depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection, and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older reported significantly higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety than adults aged 18-34. Sex, underlying health conditions, and proximity to COVID-19 deaths were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on life expectancy in Madrid (Spain),"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing substantial increases in mortality across populations, potentially causing stagnation or decline in life expectancy. We explored this idea by examining the impact of excess mortality linked to the COVID-19 crisis on life expectancy in the region of Madrid (Spain). Using data from the Daily Mortality Surveillance System (MoMo), we calculated excess mortality (death counts) for the weeks 10th to 14th in 2020 using data on expected and observed mortality, assuming no further excess mortality during the rest of the year. The expected annual mortality variation was +6%, +21% and +25% among men aged under 65, between 65 and 74 and over 75, respectively, and +5%, +13%, and 18% for women, respectively. This excess mortality during weeks 10th to 14th resulted in a life expectancy at birth decline of 1.6 years among men and 1.1 years among women. These estimates confirm that Madrid and other severely hit regions in the world may face substantial life expectancy declines.",Sergi Trias-LlimÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DF-E03-CFD,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2953,FALSE,,
Mental resilience in the Corona lockdown: First empirical insights from Europe,"Background The current Corona pandemic is not only a threat to physical health. First data from China and Europe indicate that symptoms of anxiety and depression and perceptions of stress rise significantly as a consequence of the pandemic. There are also anecdotal reports of increased domestic violence, divorce, and suicide rates. Hence, the Corona crisis is also a mental health crisis. There is urgent need for knowledge about factors that can protect mental health (resilience factors) in this world-wide crisis, which is different in nature from other crises that have so far been studied in resilience research. Methods Potential resilience factors, exposure to Corona-specific and general stressors, as well as internalizing symptoms were assessed online in N=5000 adult Europeans. Resilience, as an outcome, was conceptualized as good mental health despite stressor exposure and measured as the inverse residual between actual and predicted symptom total score. Preregistered hypotheses (osf.io/r6btn) were tested with multiple regression models and mediation analyses. Results Results confirmed our primary hypothesis that positive appraisal style (PAS) is positively associated with resilience (p<0.001). The resilience factor PAS also mediated the positive association between perceived social support (PSS) and resilience (p<0.001). In comparison with other resilience factors, positive appraisal specifically of the consequences of the Corona crisis was the single strongest factor. Conclusions This research identifies modifiable protective factors that can be targeted by public mental health efforts. Future work will have to identify potential group differences in the effectiveness of these resilience factors, for improved prevention planning.",Ilya M Veer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46135-48F-EDA,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2954,FALSE,,
"Rapid review and meta-meta-analysis of self-guided interventions to address anxiety, depression and stress during COVID-19 social distancing","We conducted a rapid review and quantitative summary of meta-analyses that have examined interventions which can be used by individuals during quarantine and social distancing to manage anxiety, depression, stress and subjective well-being. A literature search yielded 34 meta-analyses (total number of studies k = 1,390, n = 145,744) that were summarized. Overall, self-guided interventions showed small to medium effects in comparison to control groups demonstrating their effectiveness. In particular, therapeutic approaches (including cognitive-behavioral, mindfulness, and acceptance-based interventions), selected positive psychology interventions, and multi-component and activity based interventions (music, physical exercise) showed promising evidence for effectiveness. Many of these interventions are available in online or smartphone app form. At the same time, self-guided interventions on average did not show the same degree of effectiveness as traditional guided individual or group therapies. The review points to activities and practices that can be adapted by individuals as a first step to manage their mental health during social distancing and quarantines. Further research is clearly needed on activities helping individuals to interact and live in constrained living conditions (e.g, improving social interactions during quarantine) and the relative effectiveness of self-guided interventions across cultural boundaries.",Ronald Fischer et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A6-8FC-6A7,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2955,FALSE,,
Compliance with COVID-19 Mitigation Measures in the United States,"The COVID-19 mitigation measures require a fundamental shift in human behavior. The present study assesses what factors influence Americans to comply with the stay at home and social distancing measures. It analyzes data from an online survey, conducted on April 3, 2020, of 570 participants from 35 states that have adopted such measures. The results show that while perceptual deterrence was not associated with compliance, people actually comply less when they fear the authorities. Further, two broad processes promote compliance. First, compliance depended on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capacity to obey the rules, opportunity to break the rules, and self-control. As such, compliance results from their own personal abilities and the context in which they live. Second, compliance depended on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intrinsic motivations, including substantive moral support and social norms. This paper discusses the implications of these findings for ensuring compliance to effectively mitigate the virus.",Benjamin Van Rooij et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460EE-8D1-F74,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2956,FALSE,,
Daily emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 outbreak has become one of the largest public health crises of our time. Governments have responded by implementing self-isolation and physical distancing measures that have profoundly impacted daily life throughout the world. In this study, we surveyed how an Irish sample experience the activities, interactions and settings of their lives during the pandemic. The sample (N = 604) were assessed in Ireland on the 25th March, 2020, following the closure of schools and non-essential businesses. To overcome difficulties in between-person comparisons we examined within-person variance in emotional well-being and how people spend their time. We found that while most time was spent in the home, time spent outdoors was associated with markedly raised positive affect and reduced negative feelings. Exercising, pursuing hobbies and taking care of children were the activities associated with the greatest affective benefits. Home schooling children and obtaining information about COVID-19 were ranked lowest of all activities in terms of emotional experience. These findings highlight key activities that may play a protective role in relation to well-being during the pandemic, the importance of setting personal limits for exposure to COVID-19 related media coverage, and the need for greater educational supports to facilitate home schooling during this extremely challenging period.",Leonhard Lades et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46215-383-730,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2957,FALSE,,
Spatial cognition in children with physical disability; what is the impact of restrictedindependent exploration?,"On account of the developmental relationship between motor ability and spatial skills. we investigated the impact of physical disability (PD) on spatial cognition. Fifty-three children with special educational needs including PD took part. The children with PD were divided into those who were wheelchair users (N=34) and those who had independent locomotion (N=19). This division enabled us to additionally determine the impact of limited independent physical exploration on spatial competence (exploration is typically relatively restricted for wheelchair users). Performance of the PD groups was compared to that of typically developing (TD) children who spanned the range of non-verbal ability of the PD groups. Participants completed three spatial tasks; a mental rotation task, a Bee-bot route task and a desktop virtual reality (VR) navigation task. The PD groups broadly demonstrated lower levels of performance than the TD children. However, when performance was considered with reference to participantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s learning difficulties, this demonstrated that levels of impairment across tasks were broadly commensurate with their overall level of non-verbal ability. The exception to this was the performance of the PD wheelchair group on the mental rotation task, which was below that expected for their level of non-verbal ability. Group differences in task approach were evident for the Bee-Bot task; both PD groups showed a different pattern of errors than the TD group. These findings suggest that for children with learning difficulties and PD, the developmental impact of having physical disabilities on spatial ability, over and above the impact of having learning difficulties, is minimal.",Emily Farran et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46190-D78-59B,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2958,FALSE,,
Politicizing the COVID-19 Pandemic: Ideological Differences in Adherence to Social Distancing,"Data from two MTurk studies with U.S. respondents (total N =1,153) revealed an ideological divide in adherence to social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, political conservatism inversely predicted compliance with behaviors aimed at preventing the spread of the COVID-19. Differences in reported social distancing were mediated by divergent perceptions of the health risk posed by COVID-19 (Studies 1 and 2), which were explained by differences in self-reported knowledge of COVID-19 (Study 1) and perceived media accuracy in covering the pandemic (Studies 1 and 2). The politicization of COVID-19 may have prompted conservatives to discount mainstream media reports of the severity of the virus, leading them to downplay its health risks and consequently adherence less to social distancing protocols. These effects hold when controlling for key demographic characteristics as well as psychological variables, including belief in science and COVID-19-related anxiety. Thus, political ideology may uniquely explain COVID-19 behavior.",Hank Rothgerber et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DB-E7C-0DA,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2959,FALSE,,
TRENDS IN PERCEPTION OF COVID-19 IN POLISH INTERNET,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the spread of SARS CoV-2 virus responsible for COVID-19 disease, there is an urgent need to analyse COVID-2019 epidemic perception in Poland. This would enable authorities for preparation of specific actions minimizing public health and economic risks. This study aims to illustrate the media exposure of the social perception of coronavirus using the means available during the epidemic and our goal is to signal the main issues in public perception and medical commutation in real time. METHODS: We study the perception of COVID-2019 epidemic in Polish society using quantitative analysis of its digital footprints on the Internet (on mainly Google and supported by Twitter, YouTube, Wikipedia and electronic media represented by Event Registry) from January 2020 to 07.04.2020 (before and after official introduction to Poland on 04.03.2020). To this end we utilize trend analysis with a support of simple natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analysed representativeness and composition of the target group too. RESULTS: We identified three temporal major clusters of interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdeclared war against diseaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â around 11/12.03.2020 with a massive mitigation program. Later on, there is a decay in interest with additional phases: social distancing and anticrisis act with local peaks. From a sociolinguistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have found out that declarations of mitigation strategies by Polish Prime Minister or Minister of Health gather high attention on Internet users. So enacted or in force events do not affect interest in such an extent. We have observed very low correlation between colloquial searching term 'antiviral mask' in Wikipedia and encyclopaedic definition at Wikipedia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSARS-CoV-2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, which suggest that there are different mechanisms for searching for knowledge against panic related behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional and social media do not only reflect reality, but also create it. As traditional media ahead social media in time, we advise to choose news for a quick dissemination of information, however for a greater impact, social media should be used. Otherwise public information campaigns might have less impact on society than expected. For greater penetration, it might be necessary to diversify information channels to reach as many people as possible.",Andrzej Jarynowski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4605F-D3E-741,20200422,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2960,FALSE,,
Misdirection: model of information process for neuromagic,"Neuromagic is underpinned by the union of neuroscience and magic. However, the contribution between them is unbalanced. While neuroscience has used magic tricks to study different cognitive processes and develop sophisticated experiments, the returned contribution has not penetrated into magicians praxis. In neuroscience, a priori theories are supported by objective experimental data. However, this steps are switched in magic: subjective experimental evidence generates a posteriori theories. This scientifically invalid methodology leads, as a consequence, to several unvalidated theories about the same topic. To solve this problem, testing this theories with previously validated brain models is essential, as it will separate the ones that can be reproduced with realistic models from the ones that can not. Here, we use a popular brain model -the bump attractor- to describe the most studied magical principle: misdirection. Misdirection aims to avoid the detection of tricky maneuvers by affecting the attention and the memory of the spectators. Misdirection is been defined and classified in multiple ways for different magicians. For the first time, we will support with a model of neural activity, a recent misdirection classification (Bestue, 2019). The model reproduced the efficiency and provided a neural explanation for each of the three different subcategories of misdirection proposed by the classification: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdirectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdivisionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiminishmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â. That way, we provided first neuroscientific evidence for a misdirection classification. We hope this work motivates both magicians and neuroscientists to provide detailed models to different magical principles, so they rely in objective brain functioning and not in subjective psychological theories.",David Bestue,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-55E-BCC,20200423,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2961,FALSE,,
Factors affecting mental health of health care workers during coronavirus disease outbreaks: a rapid systematic review,"Introduction: The novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak currently puts health care workers at high risk of both infection and mental health problems. Considering their pivotal role in tackling this pandemic crisis, providing adequate mental health care for health care workers is imperative. This study aimed to identify the risk and protective factors for mental health outcomes in health care workers during coronavirus epidemics. Methods: A rapid systematic review was performed in three databases and current COVID-19 resources (search date March 24, 2020). Following study selection, study characteristics and effect measures were tabulated, and data were synthesized by using vote counting based on direction of effect. Risk of bias of each study was assessed and the certainty of evidence was appraised according to the GRADE methodology. Results: Out of 2605 references, 28 observational studies were selected and the identified risk and protective factors were categorized in ten thematic categories. The level of disease exposure, being quarantined as health care worker, and health fear were significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. There was evidence that clear communication and support from the organization, social support and personal sense of control and coping ability are effective protective factors. No specific mental health interventions for assisting health care workers in mental distress during infectious disease outbreaks were identified. The evidence was of very low certainty, because of risk of bias and imprecise results. Conclusion: Safeguarding mental health of health care workers during infectious disease outbreaks should not be treated as a separate mental health intervention strategy, but requires a protective approach. This study therefore suggests that embedding mental health support in a safe and efficient working environment which promotes collegial social support and personal sense of control can help to maximize resilience of health care workers during the COVID-19 global health crisis.",Niels De Brier et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604F-ABD-E4D,20200423,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2962,FALSE,,
Elevated depression and anxiety among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Mental health problems are common in pregnancy, typically affecting between 10-25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety can negatively impact both the pregnant individual and developing fetus. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants were surveyed across Canada in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, sleep and social support. We found substantially elevated psychological distress compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression, 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety, and 68% reporting elevated pregnancy-related anxiety. Higher levels of social support and longer sleep duration were associated with lower psychological symptoms across domains. This study shows concerningly elevated levels of psychological distress among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential intervention targets are needed in addition to improving protective factors related to increased social support and sleep -- these should be urgently considered to mitigate long-term negative outcomes.",Catherine Lebel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619A-1EB-8C0,20200423,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2963,FALSE,,
Auditory sentence processing in bilinguals: The role of cognitive control,"A number of research studies have shown that the unique need in bilinguals to manage both of their languages positively impacts their cognitive control processes. Yet, due to a dearth of studies at the sentence level, it is still unclear if this benefit extends to sentence processing. In monolinguals and bilinguals, cognitive control helps in reinterpretation of garden path sentences but it is still unknown how it supports the real-time resolution of interference during parsing, such as the type of interference seen in the processing of object relative (OR) sentences. In this study, we compared monolinguals and bilinguals during online spoken OR sentence processing and examined if both groups used cognitive control to resolve interference. In this eye-tracking visual world (ETL-vw) study, OR sentences were aurally presented to 19 monolingual and 21 English-Spanish bilingual adults while gaze patterns were captured throughout the time course of the sentence. Of particular interest was the post-verb position, where the listener connects the verb to its direct object. In OR constructions (e.g., ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe man that the boy pushes__ has a red shirt.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â), the verb (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“pushesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) links to its syntactically licensed direct object (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) at verb offset. During syntactic linking, the parser crosses over an intervening noun phrase (NP, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the boyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) and the two NP activations create interference. The nature of this paradigm allows us to measure interference and its resolution between the intervening NP and the displaced object in real-time. By relating sentence processing patterns with cognitive control measures, high- and no- conflict N-Back tasks, we investigated group differences in the use of cognitive control during sentence processing. Overall, bilinguals showed less interference than monolinguals from the intervening NP during the real time processing of OR sentences. This interference effect and its resolution was significantly predicted by cognitive control skills for bilingual, but not monolingual listeners. This enhanced effect in bilinguals extends previous findings of interference resolution to real time spoken sentence processing suggesting that bilinguals are more efficient than monolinguals at managing interference during complex sentence processing.",Niloofar Akhavan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46197-E37-CB1,20200423,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2964,FALSE,,

Students showed no changes in the frequency of in-person social activities.

"Faith in Trump, Moral Foundations, and Social Distancing Defiance During the Coronavirus Pandemic","Purpose: Over the past several months, the coronavirus has infected nearly 2 million Americans and killed more than 100,000. Governors have issued stay-at-home orders, and prosecutors have filed criminal charges against individuals for defying those orders. And yet, many Americans have still refused to keep their distance from their fellow citizens, even if they had symptoms of infection. This study explores the underlying causes for those who intend to defy these norms. Methods: Using national-level data from a March 2020 survey of 989 Americans, we explore intentions to defy social distancing norms by testing an interactionist theory of foundation-based moral behavior in combination with faith in President Trump. The analysis controls for a range of variables, including measures of low self-control and deterrence. Results: Low self-control is the strongest predictor of defiance intentions. Consistent with interactionist theory, defiance intentions are significantly higher for those holding a specific faith in Trump and those endorsing binding foundation. Furthermore, the interaction of these two variables is significant and in the predicted direction. The results hold for two different measures of faith in Trump. Conclusions: Even with a strong effect for low self-control, faith in President Trump is a strong predictor of refusal to social distance, and its effect is largest among individuals high in binding foundations.",Amanda Graham et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46116-CF5-AA4,20200425,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2967,FALSE,,
Face masks for the public during Covid-19: an appeal for caution in policy,"As the Covid-19 crisis deepens, some researchers have argued for the widespread routine use of face masks in community settings, despite acknowledged gaps in the evidence base for the effectiveness of such a measure. We argue that such calls are premature, and risk neglecting important potential harms and negative consequences, known and unknown. We identify potential unintended consequences at multiple levels, from individual-behavioural to macrosocial, and suggest that it is far from clear that the benefits of widespread uptake of face masks, whether encouraged or enforced by public authorities, outweigh the downsides. Finally, we make the case for caution in communicating unequivocal messages about the scientific evidence for face mask use to policy, practitioner and public audiences, given continued scientific disagreement on the question.",Graham Martin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620D-F29-304,20200425,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2968,FALSE,,
Comparing public policy implementation in Taiwan and Vietnam in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak: a review,"Taiwan and Vietnam have taken successful measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 at the early stages. Many authors attributed the successful policies to the lessons learned by these countries during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic in 2002.(Ohara, 2004) This manuscript provides a summary of recent early-stage policies that were successful in mitigating the spread and creating resilience against the negative consequences of COVID-19 in Taiwan and Vietnam. Crucially, these policies go beyond and complement social isolation. As social isolation is expected to have a negative socio-economic impact on the population and adherence is likely to decrease with time(Armitage and Nellums, 2020; Weems et al., 2020), it is important to consider a broad range of policies to promote a steady control of the COVID-19 spread. Initially, we provide a brief introduction to some general concepts related to COVID-19. Thereafter, we introduce a concise review of policies and their dates relative to the first detection case in Taiwan and Vietnam as well as doing a comparative analysis.",Matias Acosta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46231-0D4-E79,20200425,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2969,FALSE,,

The effects of governmental and individual predictors on COVID-19 protective behaviors in China: a path analysis model,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into a crisis. To contain the crisis, it is essential to build full cooperation between the government and the public. However, it is unclear which governmental and individual factors are the determinants and how they interact on protective behaviors against COVID-19. To resolve this issue, this study built a multiple mediation model and found government emergency management as information transparency and positive propaganda had more important impacts on protective behaviors than refuting rumors and supplies. Moreover, governmental factors could indirectly affect protective behaviors through individual factors such as perceived control, positive emotions, and risk perception. These findings suggest that systematic intervention programs for governmental factors need to be integrated with individual factors to finally achieve effective prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic among the public.",Bibing Dai et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46016-26B-F88,20200425,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2972,FALSE,,

Psychological Impact and Contextual Factors Associated With Physical and Mental Health Conditions of Italian Healthcare Professionals During the Covid-19 Disease Outbreak,"BackgroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“The pandemic of COVID-19 in Italy represents a unique threat in terms of psychological distress, especially among healthcare professionals. This study represents a first attempt to investigate both the psychological states and coping strategies of Italian healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Importantly, we assessed psychological distress and coping strategies regarding two phases, pre-COVID (asking participants to retrospectively recall their state in December 2019) and during the time of survey, which was in the midst of the COVID emergency outbreak (March-April 2020). MethodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Self-administered questionnaires were distributed online to healthcare professionals of different Italian regions from March 26 to April 9, 2020. The questionnaire included three main sections measuring changes in psychological states, coping strategies and demographic variables. Two linear regression models were run to analyze variations in both general health and infection-risk perception depending on changes in psychological states, coping strategies, personality trait, and demographic variables. ResultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Altogether, the direct exposure to the virus and a negative impact of the COVID-19 emergency outbreak on contextual psychological functioning contribute to the deterioration of physical and mental health, which may lead to severe future consequences for Italian healthcare workers, if not provided immediately with an effective support program. ConclusionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Both immediate and long-term monitoring psychological assistance services for healthcare workers should be implemented by local and national institutions to reestablish psychological well-being and enhance self-confidence and resilience of Italian hospital personnel.

Use of Internet data to track Chinese behavior and interest in COVID-19,"Background: During the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak, the internet became the main channel for the public to access all kinds of information. Through search engines and other media, people can aquire information about the epidemic situation in real time. Baidu, currently the top online search tool in China, has developed an internet search trends gathering and analysis tool called Baidu Index. The aim of this study was to understand the publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s focus on the epidemic and their most pressing needs through analysis of the Chinese internet usage during the first month of the outbreak, which was also the most severe period. Method: The data period selected was from January 23, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Through Baidu index, we identified hot search terms related to COVID-19 which were grouped into four categories. Searching trend analysis was obtained depicting the quantities with which each category was searched. Next, we selected the category with the highest search volume, and obtained data regarding geographic and demographic characteristics. Finally, we explored Wuhan residentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ interest in COVID-19 by tracking their online seeking behavior. Results: The public was most concerned about news of ""latest developments of epidemic"". The remaining categories in descending order of attention received were ""basic information of disease"", ""extended information"" and ""diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus pneumonia"". The mobile search volume was dominant. People searching for ""latest developments of epidemic"" mostly came from economically developed regions with a large floating population. The group with the maximum concern were men aged 20-49. The most searched terms by Wuhan residents were ""how to use a thermometer"", ""n95 mask"", ""testing kit"" and ""nucleic acid testing"". Conclusion: Through big data from internet, we can accurately understand public concerns and needs during the epidemic. If this data is used in media coverage, public health policy decision-making, and personal epidemic prevention education, it will certainly play an important role. Other countries and regions in the early stages of the epidemic can also benefit from China's experience.",Tengteng Wang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623F-8F0-FA9,20200426,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2975,FALSE,,
Study protocol for the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Survey (CPAS): A longitudinal study of Australian parents of a child 0-18 years,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health and wellbeing of Australian families. Employment and economic uncertainty, chronic stress, anxiety, and social isolation are likely to have negative impacts on parent mental health, couple and family relationships, as well as child health and development. Objective: This study aims to: (1) provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the emerging COVID-19 crisis in a close to representative sample of Australian parents and children (0-18 years); (2) identify adults and families most at risk of poor mental health outcomes; and, (3) identify factors to target through clinical and public health intervention to reduce risk. Specifically, this study will investigate the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased risk for parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mental health, lower wellbeing, loneliness, and alcohol use; parent-parent and parent-child relationships (both verbal and physical); and child and adolescent mental health problems. Methods: The study aims to recruit a close to representative sample of at least 2,000 adults aged 18 years and over living in Australia who are parents of a child 0-4 years (early childhood, N=400); 5-12 years (primary school N=800); and 13-18 years (secondary school, N=800). The design will be a longitudinal cohort study using an online recruitment methodology. Participants will be invited to complete an online baseline self-report survey (20 minutes) followed by a series of shorter online surveys (10 minutes) scheduled every two weeks for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., estimated to be 14 surveys over 6 months). Results: The study will employ post stratification weights to address differences between the final sample and the national population in geographic communities across Australia. Associations will be analyzed using multilevel modeling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the testing period. Conclusions: This study will provide timely information on the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on parents and children in Australia; identify communities, parents, families, and children most at risk of poor outcomes; and, identify potential factors to address in clinical and public health interventions to reduce risk.",Elizabeth Westrupp et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46154-B76-111,20200427,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2976,FALSE,,
The nexus impacts of the Covid-19: A qualitative perspective,"The world has been highly impacted by the COVID-19 as the virus has spread to all continents ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ about 200 countries in total. The latest update claims about 4,000,000 confirmed cases and about 300,000 confirmed deaths owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. This probably makes the COVID-19 as the most dangerous contagious disease in the era 2000s. Apart from massive publications on this topic, there is no available qualitative analysis that describes the dynamic spreads of the COVID-19 and its impacts on healthcare and the economy. Through the system archetypes analysis, this paper explains that the dynamic spread of the COVID-19 consists of the limits to growth and the success to successful structures. The limits to growth elucidates that more symptomatic and asymptomatic patients owing to infected droplets may be bounded by self-healing and isolated treatments. The success to successful structure explains that once the COVID-19 affects the economy through the lockdown, there will be a limited fund to support the government aids and the aggregate demand. In overall, this paper gives readers simplified holistic insights into understanding the dynamic spread of the COVID-19.",Muhamad Bahri,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46029-B7E-D7C,20200427,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2977,FALSE,,
Initial evidence on the relationship between the coronavirus pandemic and crime in the United States,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial changes in the daily activities of millions of Americans, with many businesses and schools closed, public events cancelled and states introducing stay-at-home orders. This article used police-recorded open crime data to understand how the frequency of common types of crime changed in 16 large cities across the United States in the early months of 2020. Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models of crime in previous years were used to forecast the expected frequency of crime in 2020 in the absence of the pandemic. The forecasts from these models were then compared to the actual frequency of crime during the early months of the pandemic. There were no significant changes in the frequency of serious assaults in public or (contrary to the concerns of policy makers) any change to the frequency of serious assaults in residences. In many cities, there were reductions in residential burglary but little change in non-residential burglary. In most cities, thefts of motor vehicles decreased while there were diverging patterns of thefts from motor vehicles.

Teens and social media during the COVID-19 pandemic: Staying socially connected while physically distant,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the health, safety, and daily lives of all individuals. Adolescents may be uniquely sensitive to this abrupt disruption in their lives due to the biological and psychological changes that occur during this developmental period. Social media has rapidly transformed the ways in which adolescents socialize and interact with one another, which has contributed to an ongoing debate about whether social media is helping or harming teens today. The COVID-19 pandemic has only magnified this societal dilemma as teens are spending more time than ever before on social media. Thus, it is important for parents, educators, and teens to better understand social media use in the context of COVID-19. This article discusses the implications of social media for adolescent development and mental health in the context of COVID-19, with attention to the ways in which social media may be especially helpful for teens in the midst of physical distancing practices, as well as how social media behaviors can negatively impact teensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ physical and mental health during this time.

Violating social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological factors to improve compliance,"Social distancing is one of the most effective measures to prevent coronavirus from rapidly spreading. Our analysis investigates the role of some variables (political partisanship, income, professional status, social norms, and uncertainty avoidance) in intentions of not complying with social distancing measures, which can lead to higher infection rates and to compromising the capacity of health systems worldwide. We applied an online questionnaire to 2,056 Brazilian participants. Our findings indicate that individuals that support right-wing parties, have lower wages, are currently unemployed, and have a higher uncertainty avoidance tendency are more prone to violating social distancing measures. Social norms also play a significant role on the intentions but only when using ingroup members (family and friends) as referents.

"Inconsistencies in a study of the relationship between sleep disorders, mental health, and gaming behaviour in Africa","In 2018, the World Health Organisation included Gaming Disorder as a new diagnostic category in the upcoming International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11; WHO, 2018). This decision was controversial among video game effects researchers (Van Rooij et al., 2018), as it was argued that methodologies and scientific standards in this area were of insufficient quality to determine a consensus about the nature of such a disorder. Further, most data collected on gaming and its health effects have been focused on North American, European, and Asian populations. Given that Africa has approximately half a billion mobile phone subscribers (Pendergrass et al., 2019) and a growing adolescent population of which an estimated 14% have mental health problems (Cortina et al., 2012), it is urgent that high-quality research is conducted that addresses the potential associations between video game use and mental health in this population. Etindele Sosso and colleagues (2020; hereafter referred to as the published paper) report the results of a large-scale study surveying players from nine African countries, a first as far as we are aware. We were surprised to read that almost one in three participants met the diagnostic criteria for gaming disorder, a rate ten times higher than meta-analytic estimates (Ferguson, Coulson and Barnett, 2011), and that 86.9% of observed variability in reported insomnia was accounted for by gaming behaviour. However, we are concerned that numerous issues in this article warrant further scrutiny, related to: (1) data provenance, (2) data inconsistencies, (3) data similarities, and (4) statistical errors. Together, these issues call into question the accuracy of the findings, and their implications for our understanding of gaming effects.",Peter James Etchells et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617B-8D0-193,20200430,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2990,FALSE,,
SCOPING REVIEW OF MOBILE PHONE APP UPTAKE AND ENGAGEMENT TO INFORM DIGITAL CONTACT TRACING TOOLS FOR COVID-19,"BACKGROUND Digital contact tracing apps have been proposed as a method of controlling the spread of Covid-19. The effectiveness of this tool depends largely on adequate levels of uptake (e.g. whether the user downloads and registers on the application) and engagement (e.g. the extent of usage of the application or its components over time). It has been estimated that approximately 60% of the population would need to use the NHSX application in order for it to be effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. It is therefore crucial that we understand the level of, and factors influencing, uptake and engagement with digital tracing applications in order to put appropriate measures in place to mitigate those issues. AIMS 1. To quantify the current data on COVID-19 digital contact tracing applications a. Uptake and engagement of COVID-19 digital contact tracing applications b. Examine whether uptake differs between countries c. Identify any predictors or correlates of uptake and engagement 2. To conduct two scoping reviews to identify key barriers and facilitators influencing engagement and uptake of a. COVID-19 digital contact tracing applications b. Health behaviour change applications, including government approved applications, from academic literature and behaviour change guidelines CONCLUSIONS ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ There is no evidence on the level of uptake and engagement with COVID-19 digital contact tracing applications. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ There is a dearth of evidence regarding the barriers and facilitators to uptake and engagement with COVID-19 digital contact tracing applications.

COVID-19-Related Anxiety Predicts Somatic Symptoms in the UK Population,"This study aimed to estimate the association between anxiety associated with COVID-19 and somatic symptoms, using data from a large, representative sample (N=2025) of the UK adult population. Results showed that moderate to high levels of anxiety associated with COVID-19 were significantly associated with general somatic symptoms, and in particular with gastrointestinal and fatigue symptoms. This pattern of associations remained significant after controlling for generalised anxiety disorder, pre-existing health problems, age, gender and income.

"Impacts of California Proposition 47 on Crime in Santa Monica, CA","We examine crime patterns in Santa Monica, California before and after passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors. We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses are conducted within a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations. Reports of monthly reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant crime increases in their vicinity after service began. While the number of reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, those not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures that enhanced outreach and patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law enforcement and policy-makers. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions.",Jennifer Crodelle et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BA-176-D73,20200430,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2993,FALSE,,

Motivation and Preference in Isolation: A test of their different influences on responses to self-isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak,"This multi-wave study examined the extent that both preference and motivation for time alone shapes ill-being during self-isolation. Individuals in the US and UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience differential ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation therefore offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression, and anxiety during time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks. However, effect sizes for both were below our minimum threshold of interest.",Netta Weinstein et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601D-62D-C8C,20200430,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2995,FALSE,,
The interplay between mothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and children behavioral and psychological factors during COVID-19: An Italian study,"Italy has been the first nation outside of Asia to face the COVID-19 outbreak. To limit viral transmission of infection, by March 10th, 2020, the Italian Government has ordered a national lockdown, which established home confinement, home (smart) working, and temporary closure of non-essential businesses and schools. The present study investigated how these restrictive measures impacted mothers and their pre-school children's behavioral habits (i.e., sleet timing and quality, subjective time experience) and psychological well-being (i.e., emotion regulation, self-regulation capacity). An online survey was administered to 245 mothers with pre-school children (from 2 to 5 years). Mothers were asked to fill the survey thinking both on their habits, behaviors, and emotions and on those of their children during the quarantine, and retrospectively, before the national lockdown (i.e., in late February). A general worsening of sleep quality and distortion of time experience in both mothers and children, as well as increasing emotional symptoms and self-regulation difficulties in children, was observed. Moreover, the interplay between the behavioral and psychological factors in predicting mothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and children's well-being perception changed when different working conditions were taken into account, especially for mothers who had to stop working or moved to smart working.

Time and Covid-19 stress in the lockdown situation: Time Free, Dying of Boredom and Sadness","A lockdown of people has been used as an efficient public health measure to fight against the exponential spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and allows the health system to manage the number of patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of both perceived stress aroused by Covid-19 and of emotions triggered by the lockdown situation on the individual experience of time. A large sample of the French population responded to a survey on their time experience during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The perceived stress resulting from Covid-19 and stress at work and home were also assessed, as were the emotions felt. The results showed that people have experienced a slowing down of time during the lockdown. This time experience was not explained by the levels of perceived stress or anxiety, although these were considerable, but rather by the increase in boredom and sadness felt in the lockdown situation. The increased anger and fear of death only explained a small part of variance in the time judgment. The conscious experience of time therefore reflected the psychological difficulties experienced during lockdown and was not related to their perceived level of stress or anxiety.",Sylvie Droit-Volet et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46233-EB8-87C,20200501,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,2998,FALSE,,
Challenging social systems under the threat of pollution: Replication and extension of Eadeh and Chang (2019),"I replicated and extended Eadeh and Chang (2019; Study 2) who found that reading a story about pollution harming a child increased self-reported liberalism and increased support for environmental regulation policies through greater negative affect (i.e., anger and disgust).

Empathy also moderated negative affect, and system-level cognition and political orientation further mediated the effect of environmental threat on liberal responses. Unexpectedly, the direct effect of environmental threat increased conservative political orientation and failed to shift political attitudes; thus, we only partially replicated Eadeh and Chang (2019, Study 2).

An Invitation to Act on the Value of Self-Care: Being a whole person in all that you do,"The emergence of COVID-19 resulted in a sudden, unprecedented change in context that impacted the way behavior analysts live and work worldwide. Any rapidly shifting context requires behavioral flexibility, in addition to the acquisition of new skills and access to resources that foster resilience in the face of practical challenges and uncertainty about the future. Behavior analysts (particularly novice practitioners) may already be vulnerable to burn-out (Plantiveau et al., 2018), and in need of greater support to adopt protective self-care practices. Such practices will enable them to continue providing effective services to distressed families, while navigating their own challenges. This paper seeks to offer behavior analysts some tools and practices drawn from the work of contextual behavior scientists that can promote well-being and resilience. This includes strategies for clarifying and committing to an overarching value of self-care, acting congruently with personal and professional values across many domains of living, and practicing self-compassion in the process.",Julia H.

The ASEANÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s responses to COVID-19: A policy sciences analysis,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) it as a pandemic on March 11th, 2020. The pandemic has brought havoc globally as more than 190 countries and territories are affected as of 30 April 2030. The crisis suggests that no country can deal with the pandemic alone. International cooperation including regional cooperation is essential for any country to survive. We are particularly interested in Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) cooperation and performance under COVID-19 because it has been one of the regions where regional cooperation on health security has been functioning based on lessons from SARS 2003 and H1N1 2009. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne Vision, One Identity, One CommunityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â of ASEAN has merits under COVID-19 response but remains invisible. The method encompasses analysis of published materials issued by and accessible from the ASEAN website, complemented with analysis for media articles including social media, supported by published academic journal articles. All of the authors have expertise on ASEAN policies in the field of health, disasters, and regional policy and planning. Some authors have also worked from various international organisations working on issues related to the ASEAN region.

This paper also compares the 10 member statesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ policy responses from January to April 2020. We utilise the framework of policy sciences to analyse the responses. We found that the early regional response was slow and lack of unity (January - February 2020). Extensive early measures taken by each member state are the key to the success to curb the spread of the virus. Although, during March and April 2020, ASEAN has reconvened and utilised its existing health regional mechanism to try to have a coherent response to the impacts. Strengthening future collaboration should be implemented by recognizing that there is a more coherent, multi sectoral, multi stakeholders and whole-of-ASEAN Community approach in ensuring ASEANÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s timely and effective response to the pandemic.",Riyanti Djalante et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606D-78F-D67,20200502,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3003,FALSE,,

Non-compliance with COVID-19-related public health measures among young adults: Insights from a longitudinal cohort study,"Background: Do young adults have low compliance rates with public health measures aimed at curbing the spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)? This paper leverages a prospective-longitudinal cohort study with data before and during the pandemic to examine this question. Methods: Data came from an ongoing cohort study (n=737). Non-compliance with public health measures and concurrent correlates were measured at age 22. Antecedent sociodemographic, social, and psychological factors were measured at ages 15-20. Findings: Young adults generally complied with COVID-19 public health measures, although compliance with some measures (e.g., cleaning/disinfecting mobile phones, standing 1.5-2 meters apart) was relatively lower. Non-compliance, especially with hygiene-related measures, was more prevalent in males, and in individuals with higher education, higher SES, and a non- migrant background. Non-compliance was associated with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œantisocial potential,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â including pre-pandemic low acceptance of moral rules, legal cynicism, low shame/guilt, low self-control, engagement in delinquent behaviors, and association with delinquent peers. Young adults with low trust, including in the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s measures for fighting the virus, also complied less. Interpretation: In order to increase voluntary compliance with COVID-19 measures, public health campaigns should implement strategies that foster moral obligation and trust in authorities, or leverage trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate information. For young adults with low self-control, self-monitoring, environmental restructuring, or nudging may increase compliance. Long-term investments into integrating antisocial youth into society may decrease rule-breaking behaviors, including during pandemics when compliance saves lives.",Amy Nivette et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613C-2ED-950,20200502,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3005,FALSE,,

Design. Cross-sectional, nationally representative study. Setting. The United Kingdom. Participants. ~19,500 households. Main outcome measures. Using multiple household-level indicators and principal components analysis, we derive summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital. Results. Our analysis highlights three key findings. First, although COVID-19 health risks are concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with working-age households more likely to face financial, housing and employment precarities, and retirement-age households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution of vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Conclusions. The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to vary by household type.

The current work investigated the emotional and behavioral reactions people experience in response to COVID-19 through their internet searches. We hypothesized that when the prevalence rates of COVID-19 increase, people would experience more fear, which in turn would predict greater rates of protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying. Methods: Prevalence rates of COVID-19 in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, were used as predictors. Fear-related emotions, protective behaviors, seeking health-related knowledge, and panic buying were indicated by internet search volumes in Google Trends. Cross-temporal analyses were conducted. Results: We found that increased prevalence rates of COVID-19 were associated with more searches for protective behaviors, health knowledge, and panic buying. This pattern was consistent across four countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

Quality of life and its factors in the COVID19 pandemic situation.

Researchers asked the question: What is peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quality of life during the COVID19 pandemic in its growth, peak, and subsidence phases. The survey was conducted based on a sample of adult Poles in electronic form. Three hundred fifty-three comprehensive responses were collected. Respondents were asked about the quality of life, coping with the objectively difficult situation, and about resource gains and losses over the past six months. The results obtained indicate that a high global quality of life correlates with higher gains and minor losses, as well as coping with the difficult situation through planning, positive reframing, emotional support seeking and reduced substance use tendency, low self-blaming, avoidance, and disengagement. Factors that may reduce peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quality of life during the COVID 19 pandemic are low resource gains and losses experienced over the last six months preceding the pandemic, and coping strategies that are characteristic of those experiencing helplessness.

"Pandemic Emotions: The Extent, Correlates, and Mental Health Consequences of Personal and Altruistic Fear of COVID-19","COVID-19 has had unprecedented effects on populations around the world. Given the political and moral context of the pandemic and the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to it, this study sought to assess the extent of AmericanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s personal fear about the virus as well as their fear for others (altruistic fear), identify potential predictors of these fears, and examine the mental health impact of heightened COVID-19 fears. Overall, a majority of respondents worried about various aspects of the virus, from being exposed to dying and reported often worrying about others, including family, the elderly, and healthcare professionals. Building on the fear of crime literature, we find that certain individuals, including those who believe they are at a high risk of dying from the virus, those who closely follow news coverage of the pandemic, and those with strong moral foundations, are likely to experience elevated fear and, possibly, its consequences.",Melissa Sloan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624B-D11-249,20200503,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3013,FALSE,,
Risk of Developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in COVID-19 Survivors: What Should Mental Health Specialists Prepare For?,"Given the high COVID-19 mortality, the disease itself may be experienced as a life-threatening and traumatic event. Therefore, in the article we try to answer three questions that are relevant to public mental health: Should mental health professionals prepare for the increase in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence due to the pandemic? Can we define groups of COVID-19 survivors who are at higher risk of developing PTSD? How can health specialists prepare for it? Given the results of previous research on PTSD in epidemic survivors (e.g. SARS), we suggest that mental health professionals in countries touched by the pandemic should prepare for an increase in the PTSD prevalence in individuals who have had COVID-19. The PTSD risk group includes mainly individuals: from groups at increased risk of complications or who have experienced complications; who were not provided healthcare due to health service overload; experiencing additional mental health problems; healthcare workers; and stigmatized groups. We postulate that individuals who experienced COVID-19 should be routinely screened for PTSD; particular attention should be given to individuals at risk. Mental health services should prepare for providing therapeutic interventions for individuals with PTSD, and support to families, especially children, of COVID-19 survivors with PTSD.",Marcin SÃƒâ€žÃ¢â€žÂ¢kowski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C6-E07-110,20200503,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3014,FALSE,,
Funny but aversive: A large-scale survey on the emotional response to Covid-19 humor in the Italian population during the lockdown,"In tragic circumstances, it is not uncommon to see an upsurge in the generation of disaster jokes, which humorously depict the macabre aspects of ongoing crises. Many of such jokes appeared also at the time of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak, often becoming viral. However, little is known about the emotional response to disaster jokes, let alone Covid-19 ones. With a large-scale survey completed during ItalyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nationwide lockdown, we studied the appreciation, i.e., funniness and aversiveness, of Covid-19 humor. Using a mixed models approach, we also analyzed the role of personality factors and psychological distance. Results showed that Covid-19 humor is associated with a mark of aversiveness, greater than for non-pandemic humor. Individuals more inclined to use humor to cope with uneasy circumstances perceived Covid-19 humor as funnier and less aversive. Furthermore, the perceived risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 amplified Covid-19 humor aversiveness, while greater spatial distance from the Italian epicenter of the contagion allowed to deeper enjoy humor both related and not-related to Covid-19. These findings should raise awareness on the emotional correlates to Covid-19 humor, of possible support in deciding whether and with whom to joke on the pandemic in social and political communication.",Luca Bischetti et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46012-BD9-A88,20200504,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3015,FALSE,,
"Imported cases, community action, policy and institutional systems drive Hong KongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s COVID-19 experience","This paper investigates the profile of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong, highlighting the unique age structure of confirmed cases compared to other states. Whilst the majority of cases in most states around the world have fitted an older age profile, our analysis shows that positive cases in Hong Kong have been concentrated amongst younger age groups, with the largest incidence of cases reported in the 15-24 age group. This is despite the populationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rapidly ageing structure and extremely high levels of population density. Using detailed case data from Hong KongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Centre for Health Department and Immigration Department, we analyze the sex and age distribution of the confirmed cases along with their recent travel histories and immigration flows for the period January to April, 2020. Our analysis highlights Hong KongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s high proportion of imported cases and large overseas student population in developing COVID-19 hotspot areas such as the United Kingdom. Combined with targeted and aggressive early policy measures taken to contain the virus, these factors may have contributed to the uniquely younger age structure of COVID-19 cases in the city.

To resolve the crisis, governments need to encourage citizens to voluntarily change their behaviour, such as social distancing and self-restraint. This is especially important in those countries where governments cannot stop people going out, congregating, or attending events, or lock down a city legally, as is the case in Japan. Previous research on social cognition has suggested that emphasising self-identity is key to changing a person's behaviour. This study will examine whether reminders that highlight self-identity are effective in controlling behaviour related to the spread of COVID-19: Will those putting greater emphasis on self-identity (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be a spreaderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) inhibit high-risk behaviours related to infection control better than those using less (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t spreadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢)?

Mental Health and Behavior During the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study in College Students,"Background Worldwide, the vast majority of people have been impacted by COVID-19. While millions of individuals have become infected, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggest this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes, but rarely are researchers able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these to previous years of data on the same individuals. Objectives We seek to answer two overarching questions by combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students participating in a longitudinal study for the past two years. First, have behaviors and mental health changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to previous time periods within the same participants? Second, did behavior and mental health changes track the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? Methods Behaviors were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs). Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term (the term in which the coronavirus pandemic started), as compared to prevous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. Results During the initial COVID-19 impacted academic term (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001), relative to the previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and week of academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term, were strongly associated with increased coronavirus-related news. When mental health metrics (e.g., depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P<.05) were significantly associated with coronavirus-related news. Conclusions Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in Winter 2020 were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, are associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods that could reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.",Jeremy F Huckins et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-203-187,20200504,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3018,FALSE,,
The Relationship between Infection-Avoidance Tendencies and Exclusionary Attitudes toward Foreigners: A Panel Study of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Japan,"Amidst an outbreak of COVID-19 in January 2020, this study, which based on the behavioral immune system, focused on the preventive behaviors related to COVID-19 infection and Japanese peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exclusionary attitude toward foreigners, examining the time-series changes associated with the spread of the novel coronavirus in Japan, which was one of the first countries to confirm cases outside China. Also, we examined the effects of individual differences in infection-avoidance tendencies and the frequency of peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s daily contact with foreigners. In late January, mid-February, and early March of 2020, this study conducted a panel survey 1,004 Japanese citizens aged 18 years or above living in Japan, and who had registered with the crowdsourcing service. The results indicated that as the spread of COVID-19 increased, tendencies toward infection-preventive behaviors increased, and exclusionary attitudes toward foreigners became stronger. Similarly, the avoidance response against unfamiliar people, including Japanese strangers increased. No relationship between the increased risk of infection and the Japanese respondentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ exclusionary attitudes toward the Chinese but were more negative than that for other groups. However, it is difficult to conclude that all the reported exclusionary behaviors and attitudes were irrational or excessive false-positive errors. People with strong infection-avoidance tendencies engaged in more preventive actions, regardless of whether they were living under normal circumstances or under threat of infection, and they indicated strong exclusionary attitudes toward foreigners in general and the Chinese specifically under threat of infection. We observed a moderating that the higher the frequency of daily contact with foreigners, the weaker the exclusionary attitudes toward them. This study recorded the behavioral and psychological states of people in Japan during the 40 days preceding the WHOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 11 March 2020 declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The data collected in Japan, where the infection spread widely early on, will provide valuable insights for countries anticipating significant social changes.",Mei Yamagata et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46224-F1E-A9F,20200505,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3019,FALSE,,
Working Memory Capacity Predicts Individual Differences in Social Distancing Compliance during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the U.S.,"Noncompliance with social distancing during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic poses a great challenge to the public health system. These noncompliance behaviors partly reflect peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s concerns for the inherent costs of social distancing while discounting its public health benefits. We propose that this oversight may be associated with the limitation in oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mental capacity to simultaneously retain multiple pieces of information in working memory (WM) for rational decision making that leads to social distancing compliance. We tested this hypothesis in 850 U.S. residents during the first 2 weeks following the presidential declaration of national emergency because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ social distancing compliance at this initial stage could be predicted by individual differences in WM capacity, partly due to increased awareness of benefits over costs of social distancing among higher WM capacity individuals. Critically, the unique contribution of WM capacity to the individual differences in social distancing compliance could not be explained by other psychological and socioeconomic factors (e.g., moods, personality, education, and income levels). Furthermore, the critical role of WM capacity in social distancing compliance can be generalized to the compliance with another set of rules for social interactions, namely the fairness norm, in Western cultures. Collectively, our data reveal novel contributions of a core cognitive process underlying social distancing compliance during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting a potential cognitive venue for developing strategies to mitigate a public health crisis.",Weizhen Xie et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C1-E37-A1B,20200505,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3020,FALSE,,
Testing early and late connectivity dynamics in the lab: an experiment using 4-agent micro-societies,"How does the order of individuals' interactions affect the emergence of shared conventions at the population level? The answer to this question is relevant for a number of fields, such as cultural evolution, linguistics, cognitive science or behavioral economics. In this study we investigate experimentally how two different network connectivity dynamics affect the evolution of the diversity of cultural variants of the communication system. We report an experiment in the lab in which participants engage in a Pictionary-like graphical communication task as members of a 4-participant micro-society, interacting in pairs with the other three members of the community across 4 rounds. The experiment has two main goals: First, to evaluate the effect of two network connectivity dynamics (early and late) on the evolution of the convergence of micro-societies on shared communicative conventions under controlled conditions. Second, to compare the predictions of the agent-based model described in a previous study (Segovia-MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n, Walker, Fay, & Tamariz, 2019) against experimental data, and calibrate the model to find the best-fitting parameter setting. Our experimental data shows that, as predicted by the model, an early connectivity dynamic increases convergence and a late connectivity dynamic slows down convergence. We found significant differences between conditions in round 3 and round 4. We estimate the best-fit parameter combination for the 96 data structures coded. Medium to high content bias, neutral to egocentric coordination bias and memory size of 3 rounds was associated with a better model fit. In the light of the model evaluation and the experiment outcome, we discuss the impact of our predictions on social influence research and possible factors that might help to improve model precision.",JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Segovia-MartÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-A6A-800,20200505,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3021,FALSE,,
Exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and UK lockdown on individuals with experience of eating disorders,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound impact on the global population. The pandemic may raise additional, unique challenges for individuals with experience of eating disorders. Many factors have potential for detrimental impacts on psychological wellbeing and eating disorder recovery, including: Disruption to living situations, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“social distancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ restrictions, difficult access to healthcare, and societal changes to food behaviours and technology usage. To date, little is known on the impact of the pandemic on this population. Method: A mixed-methods online survey was used to gather data from individuals currently experiencing, or in recovery from, an eating disorder during the early stages of the UK pandemic lockdown. Results: Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is having a profound, negative impact upon individuals with experience of eating disorders. 7 key themes are identified: Disruption to living situation, increased social isolation and reduced access to usual support networks, changes to physical activity rates, reduced access to healthcare services, disruption to routine and perceived control, changes to relationship with food, and increased exposure to triggering public messages. The results suggest detrimental impacts on psychological wellbeing including decreased feelings of control, increased feelings of social isolation, increased rumination about disordered eating, and low feelings of social support. Conclusions: This research demonstrates how the ED population is at significant risk of negative impacts of pandemics. There is a vital need for interventions to support this population during such events. Inequalities in healthcare provision were also identified, emphasising a need for a more cohesive approach to remote ED treatment across UK healthcare services. Positive aspects of technology use were identified but the results suggest a need to address and/or limit the potential for negative impacts of public messages around food and exercise behaviours, and to co-design technologies with people with EDs to facilitate effective treatment.",Dawn Branley-Bell et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C5-73D-662,20200505,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3022,FALSE,,

Connecting Self-Reported Social Distancing to Real-World Behavior at the Individual and U.S. State Level,"Social distancing is currently the single most effective method to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As such, researchers across varying fields are rushing to identify variables that predict social distancing and which interventions can heighten social distancing. Yet, much of this research relies on self-report measures (in part because of social distancing guidelines themselves). In two studies we examine whether self-reported social distancing overlaps with real-world behavior. In Study 1, individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ self-reported social distancing predicted decreased movement as quantified by participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ average daily step-counts (assessed via smartphone pedometers). For every increase of one in self-reported social distancing (z-scored), individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ daily steps decreased by approximately 21% (Exp(B) ~ .79). In Study 2, the degree of self-reported social distancing in different U.S. States predicted the degree to which people in those States reduced their overall movement and travel to non-essential retail as assessed by ~17 million smart-phone GPS coordinates (.34 < rs < .57).

Five were commentaries, six reported the findings from qualitative studies and two reported findings from cross sectional surveys. The findings and recommendations can be presented in terms of strategies that can be employed when preparing for a crisis, when in the midst of a crisis and following conclusion of a crisis. There are two key recommendations identified from the review: 1. There are things we can do now: The importance right now of ensuring that staff have both time and a safe space in which they can reflect on their experiences either with fellow staff or via peer- facilitated reflections. That way those staff who wish to, could be supported to reflect on and process their after a difficult shift. 2. There are things we can think about in the mid to longer term: the importance of organisations learning from the pandemic. Post pandemic, perhaps developing simulations, but also formally engaging in structured reflective practice to ensure practical skills are honed and lessons learned and b) paying attention to the organisational culture and ensuring that reflective practice is embedded as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“business as usualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Underpinning these two points are a range of issues organisations should bear in mind.

We surveyed multiple dimensions of social networks (pleasant interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) before and during the crisis among Swiss undergraduate students (N=212). We find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories.

In fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several messages on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19 pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and on time spent on the panels. These results suggest that norm-based interventions through fliers have very little impact on peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reading and understanding of COVID-19 pandemic response governmental rules.",Ennio Bilancini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A5-971-EA6,20200506,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3029,FALSE,,
Change in Five-Factor Model Personality Traits During the Acute Phase of the Coronavirus Pandemic,"The rapid spread of the coronavirus and the strategies to slow it have disrupted just about every aspect of our lives. Such disruption may be reflected in changes in psychological function. The present study used a pre-posttest design to test whether Five Factor Model personality traits changed with the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Participants (N=2,137) were tested in early February 2020 and again during the PresidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, Neuroticism decreased across these six weeks, particularly the facets of Anxiety and Depression, and Conscientiousness did not change. Exploratory analyses indicated that quarantine/isolation status moderated change such that Neuroticism only decreased for those not in quarantine, whereas Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness declined for participants in quarantine. The present research suggests modest changes in personality traits across the acute phase of the coronavirus outbreak.",Angelina Sutin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46137-28F-3B4,20200506,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3030,FALSE,,
Voluntary adoption of social welfare-enhancing behavior: Mask-wearing in Spain during the COVID-19 outbreak,"As the COVID-19 spreads worldwide, countries increasingly recommend wearing facemasks in public. However, its uptake remains far from universal in countries where this practice lacks cultural roots. In this paper, we identify the barriers to mask-wearing in Spain, a country with no mask-wearing culture. We conduct one of the first nationally representative surveys (n = 4,000) about the COVID-19, and uncover the associations of mask-wearing behavior with: a) demographics; b) disease-related anxiety and risk perceptions; c) personality traits; d) social acceptability of mask-wearing. Our results can serve policymakers to design programs for improving compliance. Governments should target efforts to the introverted and the highly educated, as well as advertising mask-wearing as an injunctive norm to encourage their citizens, particularly the elderly, to wear facemasks.",Joan BarcelÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-62A-3FC,20200506,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3031,FALSE,,
Are intergenerational relationships responsible for more COVID-19 cases? A cautionary tale of available empirical evidence,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, originated in Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019, rapidly spread in more than 100 countries. Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus, and deaths from the associated disease (COVID-19), in different geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists, have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. The goal of this article is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 cases in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support such a link. In fact, at the country-level higher prevalence of intergenerational co-residence and contacts is broadly positively associated with number of COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 persons), but the opposite is generally true at the sub-national level. While this inconsistent evidence neither demonstrates the existence nor the inexistence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the prevalence of COVID-19 cases, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data which suffer from many shortcomings. Only retrospective individual level data will provide robust evidence on the role of intergenerational ties. We conclude arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. From a theoretical point of view, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies devoted at fighting the spread of COVID-19 should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œphase-2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.",Bruno Arpino et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46217-A81-BAE,20200506,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3032,FALSE,,
"A scalable, single session intervention for perceived control over anxiety during COVID-19","Feelings of anxiety are rising across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social distancing mandates preclude access to in-person mental healthcare. Anxiety is not necessarily pathological; however, increased worrying about COVID-19 shows links to more severe anxiety pathology. Greater perceived control over anxiety has predicted decreased anxiety pathology, including adaptive responses to uncontrollable stressors. Evidence suggests that no-therapist, single-session interventions can strengthen perceived control over emotions like anxiety; similar programs, if designed for the COVID-19 context, could hold substantial public health value. We will test whether a no-therapist, single-session online intervention adapted for the COVID-19 context can: 1) increase perceived control over anxiety, versus a placebo intervention 2) without decreasing social-distancing intentions. We will test these questions using a within-subjects design in a weighted-probability U.S. sample (N=300). Findings will inform whether a highly-scalable intervention can increase perceived control over anxiety without yielding unwanted secondary effects.",Michael C Mullarkey et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FC-415-9EA,20200506,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3033,FALSE,,
Psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown among students and workers of a Spanish university,"The aim of this study was to analyze the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the university community during the first weeks of confinement. A cross-sectional study was conducted. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences & Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering & Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown.

Compared to the 2018 NHIS sample, U.S. adults in April 2020 were eight times more likely to fit criteria for serious mental illness (27.7% vs. 3.4%) and three times more likely to fit criteria for moderate or serious mental illness (70.4% vs. 22.0%). Differences between the 2018 and 2020 samples appeared across all demographic groups, with larger differences among younger adults and those with children in the household.

To investigate how the pandemic impacts well-being, we compiled a large and comprehensive data-set of 2231 working adults covering 454 counties across 48 states in the U.S. from social media using machine learning tools. We found that pandemic severity influenced working adultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ negative affect rather than positive affect. However, the relationship between pandemic severity and the negative affect was moderated by personality (i.e., openness and conscientiousness) and family connectedness. Specifically, pandemic severity did not influence the well-being of those who were open to new experiences, who were conscientious, and those who were connected to family. We did not find the moderation effect of age, some other personality traits (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), faith, friend connectedness, or having kids on the relationship between pandemic severity and working adultsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ negative affect.",Xiyang Zhang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46162-9FA-B75,20200507,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3036,FALSE,,

Adolescents (N=437; 78% female) were recruited across the US using social media and reported on their COVID-19 prosocial experiences (giving, receiving help), mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, belongingness), and community attachments (social responsibility, social trust, self-interest). Greater engagement in COVID-19 prosocial behavior was associated with greater anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, and social responsibility.

A post-COVID-19 model of tourism and hospitality workforce resilience,"COVID-19 is proving more disruptive to tourism and hospitality than World War II. Workers in these industries are hardest hit because few of them had continuous employment contracts before the pandemic, instead relying on non-standard and contingent arrangements including self-employment, subcontracting, and casual work. Non-standard workers typically lack entitlements such as annual, sick and carers leave. Of all hospitality workers, 65% are non-standard workers. A 25% loading on hourly wages is designed to allow them to build a safety net, but this loading is insufficient to ensure workersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ livelihoods for an extended period of time without work.

Concern About COVID-19 & Support for Universal Vote by Mail,"With public health dangers of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) unlikely to subside by the Fall 2020, several states are considering implementing universal vote by mail systems in advance of the General Election. Studying Americans' demand for these policies is important, as support for universal vote by mail could place pressure on policymakers to implement policies that encourage turnout, without jeopardizing public health. Drawing on insights from social and political psychology, we theorize that -- while self-identified liberals are typically more likely to support vote-by-mail policies than conservatives -- anxiety about COVID-19's health risks could erase these differences. In a demographically representative survey of U.S. adults conducted in late April 2020 (N = 1,015), we find strong ideological asymmetries in vote-by-mail support among individuals who are not concerned about COVID-19's health effects. However, and consistent with our theory, we find that highly-concerned liberals and conservatives alike are highly supportive of universal vote-by-mail. The results suggest that anxiety about the pandemic may play an important role in shaping demand for universal vote-by-mail policies, across the ideological spectrum.",Matthew Motta et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-5B5-57D,20200508,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3041,FALSE,,

Immigration policies such as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“public charge ruleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ may further disincentivize even authorized immigrants to seek care if they develop symptoms.

"Moving to a Plant-Based Diet Could Save Lives from Pandemics, Climate Change, and the Global Burden of Diet-Related Disease","The global shutdown of entire cities, states, and countries, and the commensurate financial fallout from COVID-19 should serve to focus our collective efforts on primary prevention of global health pandemics. COVID-19 appears to have zoonotic origins, and the evidence suggests that most viruses have zoonotic origins. Therefore, public health policy must focus on reducing animal to human transmission. Although we are currently embroiled in the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also facing other global demands on our health systems from climate change, which kills approximately 150,000 people each year, and the global burden of disease from diet, which has been linked to 1 in 5 deaths worldwide. Public policies to incentivize plant-based diets may have seemed infeasible in the past. However, the recent human and financial toll of the COVID-19 pandemic and commensurate planetary, community, and individual health benefits of reducing animal consumption strongly argue for greater attention by global leaders and should inspire global change toward primary prevention of global challenges that will benefit our health, the environment, and greatly reduce the occurrence of future pandemics.",Jim P Stimpson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-D06-D16,20200508,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3043,FALSE,,
Estimating the reproducibility & transparency of smoking cessation behaviour change interventions (2018-2019),"Background: Research activities that promote replication and transparency are crucial in the area of smoking cessation, where tobacco and pharmaceutical companies may have vested interests in the findings of health promotion research. The aim of this study is to assess the transparency and reproducibility of smoking cessation behaviour change interventions. Methods: 100 randomised controlled trial behaviour change intervention papers published 2018-2019 from the Cochrane Tobacco Group Specialised Register of controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were that the studies must be full reports of Randomised Controlled Trials, eligible for use in the parallel Human Behaviour-Change Project. All papers were independently coded by two researchers, with inter-rater reliability of coding calculated using KrippendorffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s alpha. Results: 71% of identified papers were publicly available, with 73% pre-registered in a trial registry. However, sharing of research resources facilitating replication was lower, with 13% providing accessible materials, 7% accessible data and 1% accessible analysis scripts. No papers were described as replication studies. 94% of papers provided a funding source statement, with 80% of all studies being exclusively funded by public organisations. 88% of papers provided a conflict of interest statement, with 27% of all studies reporting conflicts of interest involving pharmaceutical companies, 17% involving private companies and 3% involving tobacco companies. Conclusion: Smoking cessation intervention evaluation reports followed good practices in terms of pre-registration and public availability of finished papers. However, the provision of open data, materials and analysis was extremely uncommon and none were claimed to be replications. Transparency was relatively high, with funding sources and conflicts of interest commonly reported and low levels of reported involvement from private and tobacco companies.

Demographic and health factors associated with pandemic anxiety in the context of COVID-19,"Objectives The mental health consequences of COVID-19 are predicted to have a disproportionate impact on certain groups. We aimed to develop a brief measure, the Pandemic Anxiety Scale, to capture the specific aspects of the pandemic that are provoking anxiety, and explore how these vary by health and demographic factors. Design Data were from a convenience sample of parents (N=4,793) and adolescents (N=698) recruited in the first 6 weeks of lockdown. Methods Factor analytic and IRT methods were used to validate the new measure in both parent and adolescent samples. Associations between scores on the new measure and age, gender, household income, and physical health status were explored using structural equation modelling (SEM). Results Two factors were identified in both samples: disease-anxiety (e.g. catching, transmitting the virus) and consequence anxiety (e.g. impact on economic prospects), and unique associations with health and demographic factors were observed. Conclusions Anxieties due to the COVID-19 are multifaceted, and the PAS is a short, reliable and valid measure of these concerns.

Guidelines for TMS/tES Clinical Services and Research through the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: The COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ19 pandemic has broadly disrupted biomedical treatment and research including non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. Objective: To facilitate the reestablishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). Methods: The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. Results: A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 12-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS-related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. Conclusion: There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind.

Reopening the Doors to Center-Based ABA Services: Clinical and Safety Protocols during COVID-19,"In the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, US organizations that provide applied behavior analysis (ABA) programs to individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have implemented a variety of safety precautions to minimize the spread of the virus, often shifting center-based services to the home or telehealth. Considered essential workers, ABA providers are exempt from government directives to close, so they have both the freedom and heavy responsibility to make their own decisions about how best to keep their clients safe while continuing to provide medically necessary services. In the coming weeks and months, ABA providers will be faced with the decision about whether to reopen centers. This article does not address that decision, except to acknowledge the urgency to reopen, both to help clients and remain solvent. Political rhetoric and contradictory public information further complicate this daunting decision. Because ABA providers do not have legal guidance to shift the burden of such decisions to local and state regulators, the burden is theirs alone. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic means that no decision is clearly wrong or right, and every decision has consequences. Although ABA providers do not have their own state guidance, many states have issued guidelines for childcare providers whose operations have continued throughout the pandemic. This article analyzes that guidance, identifies common variables potentially relevant to ABA organizations,, highlights clinical considerations and procedural compliance, and provides ABA organizations with the tools to make the best decision for their clients, in their community, and on their timeline.",Julie Kornack et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603A-D4B-471,20200508,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3047,FALSE,,

The mental health impact of non-pharmacological interventions aimed at impeding viral transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic in a general adult population and the factors associated with adherence to these mitigation strategies,"As the current pandemic situation evolves, urges have been made to focus efforts toward examining the mental health status of the general population. This large-scale epidemiological investigation assesses the prevalence of depression and anxiety associated with the mitigation strategies aimed at impeding viral transmission chains during the COVID-19 pandemic. A representative sample of 10084 adults participated in the study. The results reveal that the globally ubiquitous mitigation strategies involving lockdowns, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation are associated with two to threefold increases in anxiety and depression symptoms. Risk factors and protective factors associated with these psychiatric symptoms were identified. Finally, factors associated with adherence rates to these mitigation strategies were investigated. The presented time-sensitive findings provide health-policy makers and government officials with a foundation for making informed decisions concerning the mental health impacts of the contemporaneously in-practice disease containment strategies, and suggests ways of increasing adherence to these protocols while simultaneously protecting the general public against detrimental mental health effects.",Omid V.

"Health, News and Economic Concerns During COVID-19: A Lotka-Volterra Analysis of Google Trends","During the outbreak of a pandemic like COVID-19 it is reasonable to expect a link between the amount of news people consume and how much they worry about their health and economic situation. In this study I exploit Google searches for ""symptoms"", ""unemployment"" and ""news"" as a proxy for how much people are worried about their health and economic situation and the amount of news they consume, respectively. I then use an integrable nonautonomous Lotka-Volterra model to study the interactions among these searches in three U.S. States (Mississippi, Nevada and Utah), the District of Columbia and in the U.S. as a whole. I find that the results are very similar in all areas analyzed, and for different specifications of the model. Prior to the pandemic outbreak the interactions among health worry, economic worry and news consumption are very weak. However, from around the beginning of the pandemic these interactions intensify greatly, and unemployment predates searches for news and for symptoms. Conversely, news and symptoms proceed in mutualism.

Neuroticism and Emotional Risk During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Large-scale health crises, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, may evoke negative affective responses, which are closely linked to psychological maladjustment and psychopathology. Here, we shed light on the role of the personality trait neuroticism in predicting who is at risk and why. In a large-scale experience-sampling study based on a German convenience sample (N = 1,609; 38,120 momentary reports), individuals high in neuroticism experienced more negative affect in their daily lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The effects of neuroticism on negative affect were substantially stronger than those of sociodemographic factors and personally experienced health threats. Underlying mechanisms included (a) higher attention to Covid-19-related information and higher engagement in Covid-19-related worries (crisis preoccupation), and (b) stronger negative affect during this preoccupation (affective reactivity).

Latent growth curve modeling indicated linear, inter-related increases in those variables (but not in self-reported political conservatism, social dominance orientation, ambivalent sexism or outgroup hostility) across the three waves. Cross-lagged panel analysis supported the predicted directionality of the relationships. The results are in line with terror management theory predicting that self-continuity concerns increased under mortality salience should motivate investment in cohesive groups and rejection of those dissenters who threaten the prospects of national survival. The results are also in line with findings that the threat of infectious disease increases conformity and ingroup cohesion and sexual prejudice.",Agnieszka Golec et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622D-FF7-0AE,20200510,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3052,FALSE,,
Beware of virus! Wearing a face mask against COVID-19 results in a reduction of social distancing,"In the context of Covid-19 pandemic, barrier gestures such as regular hand washing, social distancing, and wearing face mask are highly recommended. Critically, interpersonal distances depend on the physical and emotional dimensions involved in social interaction, two factors that might be affected by the current Covid-19 context. In the present internet-based experimental study, we analyzed the preferred interpersonal distance of 461 participants, when facing a virtual character either wearing a face mask or displaying a neutral, happy or angry facial expression. The results showed that interpersonal distance is significantly reduced when the characters wear a face mask compared to other conditions. Importantly, it was also reduced in participants already infected with Covid-19, or living in a low-risk area. The present findings are of dramatic importance as they indicate that the general requirement to wear a mask in social contexts can have deleterious effects, interfering with social distancing recommendations.",Alice Cartaud et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613E-437-699,20200511,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3053,FALSE,,
Trust in science and experts during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy,"Trust in science and experts is extremely important in times of epidemics to ensure compliance with public health measures. Yet little is known about how this trust evolves while an epidemic is underway. In this paper, we examine the dynamics of trust in science and experts in real-time as the high-impact epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) unfolds in Italy, by drawing on digital trace data from Twitter and survey data collected online via Telegram and Facebook. Both Twitter and Telegram data point to initial increases in reliance on and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities with the diffusion of the disease. Consistent with these increases, using a separately fielded online survey we find that knowledge about health information linked to COVID-19 and support for containment measures was fairly widespread. Trust in science, relative to trust in institutions (e.g. local or national government), emerges as a consistent predictor of both knowledge and containment outcomes. However, over time and as the epidemic peaks, we detect a slowdown and turnaround in reliance and information-seeking from scientists and health authorities, which we interpret as signs of an erosion in trust. This is supported by a novel survey experiment, which finds that those holding incorrect beliefs about COVID-19 give no or lower importance to information about the virus when the source of such information is known to be scientific.",Pietro Battiston et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608C-0AB-494,20200511,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3054,FALSE,,
Suicide of a farmer amid COVID-19 in India: Perspectives on social determinants of suicidal behavior and prevention strategies,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has impacted not only physical health but also mental health and wellbeing globally. These impacts can be critically higher among marginalized individuals and populations like farmers in India. While most of them live in poor socioeconomic conditions, recent psychosocial challenges due to the COVID-19 lockdown had brought endless suffering in their lives. In this article, we describe a case of suicide of an Indian farmer amid COVID-19 lockdown, who had debts and could not find laborers during the lockdown leading to a helpless situation committing suicide. In India, nearly 16,500 farmers commit suicide each year, which can aggravate if psychosocial and economic challenges like COVID-19 continues to affect them. We recommend psychosocial interventions among vulnerable farmers alongside strengthening economic support and institutional measures alleviating socioeconomic challenges and minimizing disparities in social determinants of suicidal behavior to prevent suicide among Indian farmers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46061-F71-059,20200511,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,DG,,Single case report,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3055,FALSE,,
Young ChildrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mental Health: Impact of Social Isolation During The COVID-19 Lockdown and Effective Strategies,"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has triggered a worldwide epidemic emergency which is an international concern given that it poses several challenges to physical and mental health of humans across the globe.

Brief online intervention to modify interpretation biases in emotional disorders: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Cognitive biases seem to play an important role in the development and maintenance of emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety. Novel procedures, known as Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM), aim to reduce these dysfunctional information processing modes. This study aims to develop a brief online intervention program to modify biased interpretations in depression and anxiety overcoming some methodological issues that have been addressed in previous literature. Methods: Volunteer participants will be recruited via social media, posters and universities. They will be randomly assigned to the experimental group or a waiting list control group. Both groups will attend two assessment sessions at the lab. The assessment will consist of questionnaires measuring cognitive and emotional variables as well as three experimental tasks to measure cognitive biases (i.e., attention, memory and interpretation). After the first assessment session only participants in the experimental group will receive a link to follow the four-sessions program at home. All participants will receive, via email, follow-up questionnaires two weeks and three months after the second assessment session. Discussion: This study will test an online program potentially beneficial to modify cognitive variables in disorders such as depression and anxiety. Several limitations of previous CBM procedures are addressed and the impact of the program both on cognitive performance and clinical symptoms will be explored.

Geriatric health in Bangladesh during COVID-19: challenges and recommendations,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting health globally, whereas older adults are highly susceptible and more likely to have adverse health outcomes. In Bangladesh, the elderly population has been increasing over the past few decades, who often live with poor socioeconomic conditions and inadequate access to healthcare services. These disparities are likely to increase amid COVID-19, which may result in high mortality and morbidity among Bangladeshi older adults. We recommend that multifaceted interventions should be adopted for strengthening social care and health systems approach to ensure wellbeing, promote preventive measures, and facilitate access to healthcare among older adults in Bangladesh. Such multipronged measures would require policy-level commitment and collaborative efforts of health and social care providers and institutions to protect health and wellbeing among this vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623C-AC5-325,20200511,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3058,FALSE,,
The effect of messaging and gender on intentions to wear a face covering to slow down COVID-19 transmission,"Now that various countries are or will soon be moving towards relaxing shelter-in-place rules, it is important that people use a face covering, to avoid an exponential resurgence of the spreading of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Adherence to this measure will be made explicitly compulsory in many places. However, since it is impossible to control each and every person in a country, it is important to complement governmental laws with behavioral interventions devised to impact peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s behavior beyond the force of law. Here we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a heterogenous, although not representative, sample of people living in the USA, where we test the relative effect of messages highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â vs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â vs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â vs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that focusing on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative to the baseline; the trend is the same when comparing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œyour communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â to the other conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of gender differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less than women intend to wear a face covering, but this difference almost disappears in counties where wearing a face covering is mandatory. We also find that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women). Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering. Men more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and these gender differences also mediate gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering.",Valerio Capraro et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-FCF-5F5,20200511,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3059,FALSE,,

Environmental precautions to limit coronavirus spread have affected food availability and access to healthy coping mechanisms, and have contributed to weight stigmatizing social media messages that may be uniquely harmful for those experiencing EDs. Additionally, changes in socialization and routine, stress, and experiences of trauma that are being experienced globally may be particularly deleterious to ED risk and recovery.

Jevons' paradox and a tax on aviation to prevent the next pandemic,"How is it possible that, in an era of unprecedented medical progress, humanity is once again caught in a major pandemic? Several lines of evidence suggest that advances in infectious diseases control facilitate the development of major urban centers, global high-speed transportation, industrial animal farming and ecosystem destruction. In turn, all of these are well known to favor such diseases, thus reproducing the same kind of dynamic previously observed in resource consumption and known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJevons' paradoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â. Such economic developments compel health systems to develop continuously just to maintain the improvements that had already been achieved, which, furthermore, became more difficult with the generalization of neoliberal policies. In this process, progresses whose primary purpose is to benefit everybody's health are transmuted into benefits for those involved in certain economic activities. This is especially apparent in the case of long-haul aviation, a profitable activity aimed mainly at a high-income minority but playing a unique role in disease transmission. The COVID-19 pandemic is, therefore, one of the most massive cost-shifting events ever. A proposal is presented to prevent comparable if not even more harmful events in the future, with two parts. First, a global fund with base funding from an internationally-agreed tax on aviation, devoted to upgrading health systems and to programs to tackle sources of emerging infectious diseases, especially wild animal trade. Second and no less important, a global agreement to fundamentally transform agri-food systems.",Salvador Pueyo,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-7E1-E08,20200512,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3063,FALSE,,
Factors Predicting Willingness to Share COVID-19 Misinformation,"We conducted a preregistered exploratory survey to assess whether patterns of individual differences in political orientation, social dominance orientation, traditionalism, conspiracy ideation, or attitudes about science predict willingness to share different kinds of misinformation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic online. Analyses revealed two orthogonal models of individual differences predicting the willingness to share misinformation over social media platforms. Both models suggest a sizable role of different aspects of political belief, particularly social dominance orientation, as predicting tendencies to share different kinds of misinformation, predominantly conspiracy theories.

"Social, Cognitive, and Emotional Predictors of Adherence to Physical Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objectives. To identify targetable psychosocial predictors of adherence to physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic using theories of health behaviour change. Methods. Using a cross-sectional sample (N = 1003) representative of the population in terms of age, gender, and urbanicity in Quebec, Canada, we examined social, cognitive, and emotional predictors of adherence to physical distancing. Results. Individuals were more likely to report adhering to physical distancing if they believed it is their civic duty to adhere (injunctive personal norms), that physical distancing will benefit others and the broader crisis (perceived benefits for others), and if they perceive that other people are following these directives (descriptive social norms). In contrast, perceived personal risk and emotional factors were not significantly related to physical distancing. Moderation analyses revealed unique predictors depending on health risk status, essential workers status, and urbanicity. Conclusions. These results highlight the importance of health beliefs and perceived social norms in shaping responses to physical distancing directives, and offer insights into ways to frame public health communications for different segments of the population.",Jean-Philippe Gouin,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46059-233-760,20200513,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3065,FALSE,,
The Dual-System Hypothesis of Bipolar Spectrum Disorders: A Meta-Analysis,"Bipolar spectrum disorders are characterized by alternating intervals of extreme positive and negative affect. We performed a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis that such disorders would be related to dysregulated reinforcement sensitivity. First, we reviewed 22 studies that reported the correlation be-tween self-report measures of (hypo)mania and measures of reinforcement sensitivity. A large relation-ship was found between (hypo)mania and reward sensitivity (g = .75), but not with punishment sensi-tivity (g = -.05). This stands in contrast to self-reported depression which was found to have a small, negative relationship with reward sensitivity and a large positive one with punishment sensitivity (Katz et al., 2020). Next, we reviewed 32 studies that compared reinforcement sensitivity between euthymic, bipolar participants and healthy controls. There, bipolar disorder had a small, positive relationship with reward sensitivity (g = .19) and a medium, positive relationship with punishment sensitivity (g = .64). These findings support a dual-system theory of bipolar disorders, wherein reward sensitivity is more closely related to mania and punishment sensitivity more closely to bipolar depression. Bipolar disorders show diatheses for both states with euthymic participants being hypersensitive to both rewards and punishments. Implications for further theory and research practice are expounded upon in the discussion.",Benjamin A Katz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F2-E67-FF4,20200513,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3066,FALSE,,
The intelligent lockdown: Compliance with COVID-19 mitigation measures in the Netherlands,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dutch government has introduced an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œintelligent lockdownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â with stay at home and social distancing measures. The Dutch approach to mitigate the virus focuses less on repression and more on moral appeals and self-discipline. This study assessed how compliance with the measures have worked out in practice and what factors might affect whether Dutch people comply with the measures. We analyzed data from an online survey, conducted between April 7-14, among 568 participants. The overall results showed reported compliance was high. This suggests that the Dutch approach has to some extent worked as hoped in practice. Repression did not play a significant role in compliance, while intrinsic (moral and social) motivations did produce better compliance. Yet appeals on self-discipline did not work for everyone, and people with lower impulse control were more likely to violate the rules. In addition, compliance was lower for people who lacked the practical capacity to follow the measures and for those who have the opportunity to break the measures. Sustained compliance, therefore, relies on support to aid people to maintain social distancing and restrictions to reduce opportunities for unsafe gatherings. These findings suggest several important practical recommendations for combating the COVID-19 pandemic.",Malouke Esra Kuiper et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46250-3D8-119,20200513,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3067,FALSE,,
Changes in police calls for service during the early months of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic,"The coronavirus pandemic poses multiple challenges for policing, including the need to continue responding to calls from the public. Several contingency plans warned police to expect a large and potentially overwhelming increase in demand from the public during a pandemic, but (to the author's knowledge) there is no empirical work on police demand during a major public-health emergency. This study used calls-for-service data from ten large cities in the United States to analyse how calls for service changed during the early months of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak, compared to forecasts of call volume based on data from previous years. Contrary to previous warnings, overall the number of calls went down during the early weeks of the pandemic. There were substantial reductions in specific call types, such as traffic collisions, and significant increases others, such as calls to dead bodies. Other types of call, particularly those relating to crime and order maintenance, continued largely as before. Changes in the frequency of different call types present challenges to law enforcement agencies, particularly since many will themselves be suffering from reduced staffing due to the pandemic.

Flattening the Mental Health Curve in the Time of COVID-19: A Call to Action for Clinical Psychological Science,"COVID-19 presents humanity with one of the greatest health and economic crises of the 21st Century. Because COVID-19 has already begun to precipitate a huge increase in mental health problems, we believe that clinical science must also play a leadership role in guiding a national response to this secondary crisis. In this article, we explain why COVID-19 is a game-changer, as a unique, compounding, multi-dimensional stressor that will create a vast need for intervention, and necessitate new paradigms for mental health service delivery and training. We highlight the most urgent challenge areas for clinical science, including managing potential spikes in depression, anxiety, and suicide, and address the unique COVID-19-related needs across the lifespan and the challenges that COVID-19 places on families and relationships. Clinical science also will need to address the mental health of medical care workers, mitigate health disparities, and address stigma among the most vulnerable as the pandemic unfolds. For each challenge area, we suggest research directions, clinical approaches, and policy issues that need to be considered. We then discuss how to enable multi-level deployment of potential solutions and how clinical science must itself adapt to identify and deliver these solutions. We conclude by highlighting new areas for clinical science discovery and additional funding needs.

Exploring the influence of temporal factors on age differences in working memory dual task costs,"Working memory is defined by many as the system that allows us to simultaneously store information over brief time periods while engaging in other information processing activities. In a previous study (Rhodes et al., 2019) we found that retention of serially presented letters was disrupted by the introduction of an arithmetic processing task during a 10 second delay period. Importantly, the magnitude of this dual task disruption increased with age from 18 to 81. The demands of each task were adjusted prior to dual task so that age differences did not reflect baseline differences in single task performance. Motivated by these findings, theories of working memory, and additional analyses of processing reaction times from this previous experiment, we report three experiments, using the same tasks and adjustment procedure, attempting to modulate the magnitude of age differences in dual task effects. Providing a delay prior to processing activities, to facilitate switching between the two tasks, did not modulate age differences. Neither did separating the to-be-remembered material in time, to allow for the creation of more distinct representations, nor spacing the processing events in time, to allow for maintenance activities to be performed during free time. These findings provide multiple replications of our initial finding and suggest that age differences in working memory dual tasking are not due to limitations in speed of processing.",Stephen Rhodes et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46155-2AB-B3D,20200513,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3071,FALSE,,
The Perception of Infection Risks during the Early and Later Outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany: Consequences and Recommendations,"In three studies (N = 1,055), we investigated the determinants and consequences of the perception of infection risks during the early and later outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. IndividualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ perceived COVID-19 infection risk was reasonably in line with expertsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ assessment but changed over time. The probability of the rare event of getting severely sick and hospitalized was overestimated. Overestimation increased in the exponential growth phase of the pandemic and later on decreased again, showing an inverse U-shaped pattern. Individuals showed biases in their risk perception concerning overconfidence and the underestimation of exponential growth of infection cases in the early phase of the pandemic. Forecasts were more accurate after the growth curve had flattened. Risk perceptions increased with perceived dread and tended to increase with perceived control over infection, the evaluation of scientific and own knowledge about the pandemic. Approval for the introduction of stricter governmental measures and acceptance of future vaccination measures was mainly influenced by rational utilitarian factors of risk perception (probabilities and utilities of outcomes). These rational influences were mediated by dread, but dread had an additional potentially irrational effect. Adherence to governmental recommendations was mainly driven by dread and positive expected long-term consequences of the measures. To a smaller degree, adherence increased with perceived personal consequences of infection and decreased with negative expected short-term consequences of these measures. Implications for theory development are discussed and recommendations to handle virus outbreaks are derived.",Andreas GlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ckner et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-A59-DC3,20200514,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3072,FALSE,,

The lethal spiral: Racial segregation and economic disparity jointly exacerbate the COVID-19 fatality in large American cities,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, racial minorities in the United States, particularly Blacks and Hispanics, account for a disproportionate percent of deaths. The unequal distribution of COVID-related fatalities along the racial lines may result from the segregation of Blacks and Hispanics in neighborhoods afflicted with poverty and all accompanying health-compromising conditions (e.g., discrimination, poor hygiene, congested housing, poor chronic health of residents, and limited access to medical services). We thus anticipated that American cities would be especially vulnerable to COVID-19, thereby exhibiting an accelerated rate of growth of the disease, if they had elevated levels of both economic disparity and racial segregation. To test this expectation, we examined the growth rate of both confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in the first 30-day period of the outbreak in the counties subsumed under each of the 100 largest metropolitan cities. We observed that the growth curve was particularly steep in counties with high economic disparity that were located in cities that segregated Blacks and Hispanics. The current evidence underscores an urgent need to build a less segregated, more equal, and thus, more virus-resilient society.",Qinggang Yu et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B7-E63-AB2,20200514,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3074,FALSE,,
A longitudinal cohort study investigating inadequate preparation and death and dying in nursing students: Implications for the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Aims and objectives To investigate how changes in the levels of preparedness and experiences of death and dying influence nursing studentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mental health. Background The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause significant trauma in the nursing population. The lack of preparation, in combination with a substantial loss of life, may have implications for the longer-term mental health of the nursing workforce. Nursing students have, in many cases, been an important part of the emergency response. Design A longitudinal cohort study was conducted with data collected at two time points. There was a seven-month time period between data collection. Methods Participants completed paper-based questionnaires measuring demographics, academic stressors, clinical stressors, and mental health. 358 nursing students at time point one and 347 at time point two (97% retention) completed the survey. Results Inadequate preparation (OR: 1.783) and the inadequate preparation x death and dying interaction term (OR: 4.115) significantly increased risk of mental health problems over time. Increased death and dying alone did not increase mental health risk. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that it is not the increase in death and dying per se that causes mental health difficulties, but that it is instead the experience of high levels of death and dying in combination with inadequate preparation. The data are considered within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with both inadequate preparation and the scale of death and dying being two significant stressors during the emergency period. Relevance to Clinical Practice This paper is an initial indication of the potential longer-term mental health impact of COVID-19 for nursing students.",John Galvin et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46113-74C-173,20200515,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3075,FALSE,,
Voice-hearing and personification: Characterising social qualities of auditory verbal hallucinations in early psychosis.,"Background: Recent therapeutic approaches to auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) exploit the person-like qualities of voices. Little is known, however, about how, why and when AVH become personified. We aimed to investigate personification in individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ early voice experiences. Methods: We invited users of Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services aged 16ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“65 to participate in a semi-structured interview on AVH phenomenology. Voice-hearers in the first nine months of using EIP were recruited through two NHS trusts in the North-East of England. We used content and inductive thematic analysis to code the interviews, then examined key associations with personification using a variety of statistical methods. Results: Forty individuals participated between September 2017 and April 2019. Many participants reported a range of negative emotions (predominantly fear, 60%, 24/60, and anxiety, 62.5%, 26/40), visual hallucinations (75%, 30/40), bodily states (65%, 25/40), and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfelt presencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â (52.5%, 21/40) in relation to voices. Complex personification, reported by a sizeable minority (16/40, 40%), was associated with experiencing voices as conversational (OR = 2.56) and companionable (OR = 3.19), but not as commanding or connected to trauma. Neither age of onset nor time since voices were first reported related to voice personification. Conclusions: Our findings affirm recent investigations of the heterogeneity of AVH while offering new insights into the variety and significance of personified voices. Personified voices appear to be distinguished less by their intrinsic properties, commanding qualities or connection with trauma, than by their affordances for conversation and companionship.",Ben Alderson-Day et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46214-145-78D,20200515,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3076,FALSE,,
Motivational effects on empathic choices,"Empathy often feels automatic, but variations in empathic responding suggest that, at least some of the time, empathy is affected by oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s motivation to empathize in any particular circumstance. Here, we show that people can be motivated to engage in (or avoid) empathy-eliciting situations with strangers, and that these decisions are driven by subjective value-based estimations of the costs (e.g., cognitive effort) and benefits (e.g., social reward) inherent to empathizing. Across seven experiments (overall N = 1,348), and replicating previous work (Cameron et al., 2019), we found a robust empathy avoidance effect. We also find support for the hypothesis that individuals can be motivated to opt-in to situations requiring empathy that they would otherwise avoid. Participants were more likely to opt into empathy-eliciting situations if 1) they were incentivized monetarily for doing so (Experiments 1a and 1b), and 2) if a more familiar and liked empathy target was available (Experiments 2a and 2b). Framing empathy as explicitly related to oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moral character and reputation did not motivate participants to engage in empathy (Experiment 3a and 3c), though these null results may be due to a weak manipulation. These findings suggest that empathy can be motivated in multiple ways, and is a process driven by context-specific value-based decision making.",Amanda M Ferguson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46245-29E-990,20200515,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3077,FALSE,,

The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health & wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study,"Background: COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23th April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results: 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B=3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B= 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B=3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B=7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms.

The double bind of communicating about zoonotic origins: Describing exotic animal sources of COVID-19 increases both healthy and discriminatory avoidance behaviors,"Many novel diseases are of zoonotic origin, likely including COVID-19. Describing diseases as originating from diverse exotic animals can increase risk perceptions and protective avoidance behaviors, but may also activate stereotypes, increasing discriminatory behaviors and disease stigma. Data from the first several weeks of the US COVID-19 pandemic tested how communications about zoonotic disease origins affect peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s risk perceptions, health behaviors, and stigma. Participants (N = 677) who read news articles describing exotic animals (e.g., snakes) as sources of COVID-19 viewed the virus as riskier and reported stronger intentions to engage in preventative behaviors (e.g., handwashing), relative to those who read about a familiar source (pigs). Reading exotic origin descriptions was associated with stronger intentions to avoid Asian individuals and animal products, both of which contributed to greater stigma for COVID-19. Results have implications for public health communicators who aim to increase risk perceptions without activating stigma or prejudice.",Mark et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619B-99D-F3D,20200516,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3080,FALSE,,

COVID-19 and suicide of an army soldier in India: perspectives on psychosocial epidemiology of suicidal behavior,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is critically impacting health and wellbeing around the world. In addition to physical health problems, COVID-19 is increasingly reported to be associated with mental health problems across populations. Evidence from the current pandemic and earlier infectious disease outbreaks suggests that several psychosocial factors, including fear and susceptibility of infection, stigma, lack of awareness, pre-existing health problems, and poor social support affect the mental health status among the vulnerable individuals and populations. Moreover, social determinants of mental health are disproportionately distributed across populations, which also affect coping with adverse psychosocial conditions. During COVID-19 pandemic, many psychological challenges are aggravating globally, including suicidal behavior.

Psychological/psychiatric impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak: lessons learnt from China and call for timely crisis interventions in Italy,"Background: The World Health Organization declared the Corona Virus Disease 19 (Covid-19) a pandemic in March 2020. Psychological impact of Covid-19 can be consisent and should be prevented with adequate measures. Methods: We performed a literature mini review searching for studies in PubMed focusing on the psychological/psychiatric impact of Covid-19. Results: The selection process yielded 34 papers focusing on the relation between Covid-19 and mental health: 9 correspondence, 8 letters to the editor, 7 commentaries, 3 editorials, 4 original studies, 2 brief reports, and 1 a rapid review. The majority of the articles were performed in China. They focused on the general population and particular categories considered more fragile, e.g., psychiatric patients, older adults, international migrant workers, homeless people. Authors are unanimous in believing that Covid-19 will likely increase the risk of mental health problems and worsen existing psychiatric disorders/symptoms in patients, exposed subjects, and staff. Together with the negative emotionality related to the unpredictability of the situation, uncertainty concerning the risk, excessive fear, fear of death, loneliness, guilt, stigma, denial, anger, frustration, boredome, some symptoms might appear such as insomnia until patophobia (specifically, coronaphobia), depressive and anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal risk.

The COVID-19 epidemic in rural U.S. counties,"Having first reached epidemic proportions in coastal metropolitan areas, COVID-19 has spread around the country. Reported case rates vary across counties from zero to 126 per thousand population (around a state prison in the rural county of Trousdale, Tennessee). Overall, rural counties are underrepresented relative to their share of the population, but a growing proportion of all daily cases and deaths have been reported in rural counties. This analysis uses daily reports for all counties to present the trends and distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural counties, from late March to May 21, 2020. I describe the relationship between population density and case rates in rural and non-rural counties. Then I focus on noteworthy outbreaks linked to prisons, meat and poultry plants, and nursing homes, many of which are linked to high concentrations of Hispanic, American Indian, and Black populations. The growing epidemic in rural counties is apparently driven by outbreaks concentrated in these institutional settings, which are conducive to transmission. The impact of the epidemic in rural areas may be heightened due to their weaker health infrastructure and more vulnerable populations, especially due to age, socioeconomic status, and health conditions. As a result, the epidemic may contribute to the ongoing decline of health, economic, and social conditions in rural areas.",Philip N.

What was the impact of COVID-19 on Adolescent and Young Adult cancer care and their wellbeing? Results from a cross-sectional online survey conducted in the early stages of the pandemic,"Background: Due to the global spread of COVID-19, oncology departments across the world rapidly adapted their cancer care protocols, balancing the risk of delaying cancer treatments and risk of COVID-19 exposure. Little attention was given to the psychological impact of COVID-19 and associated changes on cancer patients. We wanted to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on young people living with and beyond cancer. Method: We surveyed 177 individuals, aged 18 - 39 years, about the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer care and psychological wellbeing in a cross-sectional study. Participants also reported their information needs relating to COVID-19. Responses were summarized descriptively and qualitative answers were analysed thematically. Results: This is the first study to examine psychological functioning of young patients and survivors during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Close to a third of respondents reported increased levels of psychological distress, and as many as 60% reported feeling more anxious than they did prior to COVID-19. More than half also wanted more information tailored to them as young cancer patients. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and changing the landscape of cancer care. Young people living with cancer are a unique population and might be more vulnerable during this time compared to their healthy peers. There is a need to screen for psychological distress and attend to young people whose cancer care has been delayed.

Testosterone administration in women increases the size of their peripersonal space,"Peripersonal space (PPS) is the space immediately surrounding the body, conceptualised as a sensory-motor interface between body and environment. PPS size differs between individuals and contexts, with intrapersonal traits and states, as well as social factors having a determining role on the size of PPS. Testosterone plays an important role in regulating social-motivational behaviour and is known to enhance dominance motivation in an implicit and unconscious manner. We investigated whether the dominance-enhancing effects of testosterone reflect as changes in the representation of PPS in a within-subjects testosterone administration study in women (N=19). Participants performed a visuo-tactile integration task in a mixed-reality setup. Results indicated that the administration of testosterone caused a significant enlargement of participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ PPS, suggesting that testosterone caused participants to implicitly appropriate a larger space as their own.

Preparing for a COVID-19 vaccine: Identifying and psychologically profiling those who are vaccine hesitant or resistant in two general population samples,"Successful delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine may be undermined if populations are not receptive to inoculation as a primary public health strategy for combatting the virus.

Vaccine hesitancy was evident for 26% and 25% of Irish and UK samples, respectively, while vaccine resistance was evident for 9% and 6%, respectively. Vaccine hesitant/resistant respondents in Ireland and the UK differed in relation to a number of sociodemographic, political, and health-related variables, but were similar across a broad array of psychological constructs. In both populations, those who were resistant to a COVID-19 vaccine were less likely to obtain information about the pandemic from traditional and authoritative sources and had similar levels of mistrust in these sources.

Compliance Without Fear: Predictors of Protective Behavior During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic requires rapid public compliance with advice from health authorities. Here, we ask who was most likely to do so during the first wave of the pandemic. We conducted cross-sectional and panel surveys in eight Western democracies between March 19 and May 16 asking 26,508 citizens about their protective behavior relating to COVID-19. Consistent with prior research on epidemics, we find that perceptions of threat and risk factors are crucial and culturally uniform determinants of protective behavior. On this basis, authorities could potentially foster further compliance by appealing to fear of COVID-19, but there may be normative and practical limits to such a strategy. Instead, we find that another major source of compliance are feelings of efficacy. Using individual-level panel data, we find evidence that feelings of efficacy are amendable to change and exert a causal effect on protective behavior. Importantly, the effects of such feelings are especially strong among those who do not feel threatened, creating a path to compliance without fear. In contrast, two other major candidates for facilitating compliance from the social sciences, interpersonal trust and institutional evaluations, have surprisingly little motivational power. To combat future waves of the pandemic, health authorities should thus focus on facilitating efficacy in the public.",Frederik Juhl JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rgensen et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46049-4D7-09F,20200519,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3092,FALSE,,
Determinants of Income Shares and the Stable Middle in post-Socialist China,"This paper offers a historical analysis on how post-Socialist ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transition to a globalised mixed-market economy led to class restructuring and estimates the drivers of its inter-decile income shares over the period 1978-2015 using Piketty et al. (2019)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dataset. The key negative determinants of the bottom 50 percent are government consumption, trade openness and unemployment rate. The stable middle 40 percent is explained by the positive effects of government consumption, financial liberalisation and public indebtedness that compensate for the adverse effects of trade openness. Further, we find that government consumption, trade openness, and unemployment rate are positive determinants of the top 10 percent. More strikingly, trade openness disproportionately benefits the top 10 percent and this suggests that even ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pragmatic world integration has been partial to business elites. Several policy ideas follow. First, China must overhaul its middle class urban-biased fiscal expenditure and second, the pension system must extend to the entirety of its income distribution.

Sociodemographic Determinants of Occupational Risks of Exposure to COVID-19 in Canada,"The activities performed by Canadian workers in some occupations may increase the risk of exposure to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This research note explores how occupational exposure risks vary by labour force characteristics using publicly available Canadian data in combination with a dataset providing information on the level of physical proximity and frequency of exposure to infections or diseases faced by workers in different occupations. I find important sociodemographic differences. First, women work in occupations associated with significantly higher average risks of exposure to COVID-19 than men. This is driven by their over-representation in high-risk broad occupational categories such as health occupations. Second, older workers (65 years old or more), a group vulnerable to COVID-19, appear to work in occupations requiring performing activities that require a lower level of physical proximity than their younger colleagues, with minimal differences in the frequency of exposure to diseases or infections. Finally, workers in low-income occupations are employed in occupations that put them at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 than other workers. This is especially the case for women, immigrants and members of visible minority groups in low-income occupations. More broadly, this research note provides insights into the health-related dimension of the literature on occupational tasks and labour market stratification.",Xavier St-Denis,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46014-041-896,20200519,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3095,FALSE,,

"Socioeconomic inequality and COVID-19 prevalence across municipalities in Catalonia, Spain","This study provides preliminary evidence regarding associations between socioeconomic inequalities and variations in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases across 923 municipalities in Catalonia, Spain, as of the 14th of May, 2020. We consider three types of inequalities at municipality-level: 1) economic development, i.e., unemployment rate, average income, immigrants proportion, and the prevalence of small residence; 2) health vulnerability, i.e., crude death rate and the proportion of elderly (aged 65 +) population; and 3) information communication, i.e., the proportion of people with tertiary education. In addition to the static analysis with the total sum of COVID-19 cases, the dynamic analysis with daily moving weekly sum of cases is conducted. The result draws a rather complex picture of relationships between contextual socioeconomic inequalities and the spread of COVID-19. Many indicators of economic inequalities imply the opposite relationship as intuitively suggested: economically disadvantaged municipalities tend to have less cases of confirmed infection than economically advantaged counterparts. The implications from health inequality indicators show mixed patterns: crude death rate is positively associated, but elderly population is negatively associated, with the number of confirmed cases. The indicator of information inequality shows a consistent tendency, i.e., municipalities with more university educated have less confirmed cases, but this tendency transforms across time: the negative association is particularly strong during the first month of Spanish ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstate of alarmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â measure (mid-March to mid-April).

Mental Health and Its Psychosocial Predictors during National Quarantine in Italy against the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â19),"There is scant evidence on the psychological impact of national quarantine and its psychosocial predictors. This research aimed at investigating the psychological impact of national quarantine in Italy, and the psychosocial factors that are supposed to influence this impact. A convenient sample of 1569 people living in Italy responded to an online survey using virtual snowball sampling. The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, perceived likelihood of infection, perceived coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak. Results revealed that gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women. The scores on well-being were significantly lower in the current study than in a previous validation study. The results of the study provided both theory and practical implications in understanding mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine.",Gabriele Prati,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46064-A0A-1ED,20200520,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3098,FALSE,,
"Intentions to comply with COVID-19 preventive behaviors are associated with personal beliefs, independent of perceived social norms","Social norms can be an effective way to promote public health and encourage healthy behaviors among individuals. The global COVID-19 pandemic has prompted health officials to call for new behavioral norms to help prevent the diseaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spread, for example ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsocial distancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â measures. Yet whether people actually intend to engage in these behaviors (behavioral intention) may depend on both whether they personally find them effective (individual beliefs), and whether they think others will engage in them too (perceived norms). In this study we tested three hypotheses on the relationships between individual beliefs, perceived norms, and behavioral intentions related to COVID-19 preventive health behaviors. We predicted: H1) that perceptions of othersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ beliefs about the importance and impact of preventive behaviors (perceived norms) would be lower than individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ own beliefs (i.e., a pluralistic ignorance effect); H2) that perceived norms and individual beliefs would each predict behavioral intentions; and H3) that the difference between perceived norms and individual beliefs would uniquely predict behavioral intentions. We observed large self-other differences in beliefs about preventive health behaviors (support for H1). However, only individuals' own beliefs were associated with behavioral intention, not perceived norms or the self-other gap (no support for H2 or H3). In short, individuals did not differ in their preventive behavioral intentions based on the differences (or their lack thereof) between perceived social norms and their personal beliefs. Participants who strongly believed that preventive behaviors are important ignored normative pressures from average Americans, who they perceived as less concerned than themselves. Together, these findings highlight the different roles personal beliefs and perceived norms might play in forming behavioral intentions.",Jeffrey Martin Lees et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46110-23A-F6A,20200520,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3099,FALSE,,
"HEXACO Traits, Big Five Traits, and COVID-19","Trait research on health has primarily focused on chronic diseases, and those findings may not generalize to acute infectious diseases. In the current study, I analyze the correlations between personality traits and attitudes toward COVID-19. Data were collected at the onset of the U.S. epidemic, when COVID-19 was salient to the public. Questionnaires were administered to 172 undergraduates at a public university. These questionnaires measured seven attitudes toward COVID-19, personal risk, and public health. HEXACO trait data had already been collected at this time from all participants, and Big Five data had been collected from a subset of 100 participants. The findings suggest that there are weak-to-moderate correlations but no strong correlations between Big Five traits, HEXACO traits, and attitudes. Conscientiousness was associated with greater trust, and openness with less trust in U.S. and European governmentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ preparedness for future epidemics. Openness was also associated with less fear of getting infected after being exposed to a person who had or was exposed to COVID-19. The generalizability of these results is low, but this information may be useful for setting priors in Bayesian statistics for future studies. The findings also pertain to the convergent validity of HEXACO and Big Five trait models.",Chris C.

Level and Predictors of PTSD Symptoms Among Health Workers and Public Service Providers During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"In the frontline of the pandemic stand healthcare workers and public service providers, occupations which have proven to be associated with increased mental health problems during pandemic crises. The objective of current study was to determine the level and predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression symptoms among healthcare workers and public service providers exposed to COVID-19 patients. This epidemiological investigation, cross-sectional and survey-based study collected data from 1778 healthcare workers and public service providers throughout Norway between March 31, 2020 and April 7, 2020. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression were assessed by the Norwegian version of the PTSD checklist (PCL-5), General Anxiety Disorder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“7, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Health anxiety and specific predictors were assessed with specific items. Multiple regression analysis was used for predictor analysis. Of 1778 participants 181 [10.2%] were medical doctors, 771 [43.4%] were nurses, 244 clinical psychologists [13.7%], and 78 other health workers [4.4%]. Public service providers included social workers (158 [8.9%]), politicians (37 [2.1%]) and other professions (309 [17.4%]). A total of 27.7% of the sample had clinical or subclinical symptoms of PTSD, and 21.2% and 20.5% were above the established cut-offs for anxiety and depression. Those working directly in contrast to indirectly with COVID-19 patients had significantly higher PTSD symptoms. Worries about job and economy, negative metacognitions, and burnout were significantly associated with PTSD symptoms, after controlling for demographic variables and psychological symptoms. Appropriate action to monitor and reduce PTSD, anxiety, and depression among these groups of individuals working in the frontline of pandemic with crucial societal roles should be taken immediately.",Sverre Urnes Johnson et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606C-07E-038,20200520,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3101,FALSE,,

We examined whether irrational beliefs predict adherence to COVID-19 guidelines as well as susceptibility to such misinformation. Irrational beliefs were indexed by cognitive intuition, Type I error cognitive biases, COVID-19 knowledge overestimation, and belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories. Participants (N=407) reported (a) how often they followed guidelines (e.g., handwashing), (b) how often they engaged in pseudoscientific practices (e.g., consuming garlic, colloidal silver), and (c) their intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Conspiratorial beliefs consistently predicted all three outcomes. Cognitive intuition and knowledge overestimation predicted lesser, while cognitive biases predicted greater adherence to guidelines. Cognitive intuition and cognitive biases predicted greater use of pseudoscientific practices.

Effects of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic on Social Behaviours: From a Social Dilemma Perspective,"The health crisis of the COVID-19 outbreak has global impacts on humanity and the economy. Such pandemic effects also influence human behaviour; issues of panic buying (overbuying) and noncompliance with government orders and law among individuals are evident. However, the underlying understanding of such behaviours due to the pandemic remains unclear. Therefore, this perspective paper adopts the social dilemma theory and microeconomics concepts to analyse and explain the effects of COVID-19 on social behavioural reactions. It attempts to address the questions of what and why are the behaviours of individuals shown during the coronavirus pandemic and showcase how the theory is associated with the current social phenomena. Real scenarios based on media reporting from the sociodemographic context of Malaysia, concerning the following issues; (i) competition over daily essentials; (ii) self-honesty of individuals; and (iii) adherence to government policies and measures enforcement (governance) were discussed. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate interrelationships between social dilemma concepts and the phenomena. In essence, due to fear, uncertainty, and greed, self-interest and opportunistic (defective/unethical) behaviours of most individuals prevailing over societal collective interest amid the pandemic have been prevalently observed in the above instances, although a cooperative choice can eventually result in a better outcome for everyone. Not only do these non-cooperative behaviours of individuals create inconveniences, dissatisfactions, and other forms of negative externalities, they also incentivise others to act selfishly, if no restrictions are imposed, which may eventually cause government intervention failures. This paper demonstrates the relevancy of the social dilemmas theory in better understanding fundamental human behavioural reactions amid the health crisis and the importance of incorporating the findings into government policymaking. These sociopsychological considerations help the government formulate holistic measures, namely stringent sanctions and monitoring enforcement, as well as incentivising cooperative and compliant behaviours of the public, which then contribute to curbing the COVID-19 pandemic more effectively.",Gabriel Hoh Teck Ling et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C8-609-C34,20200521,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3105,FALSE,,

Can we rely on trust in science to beat the COVID-19 pandemic?,"In order to provide time critical information on the social determinants of health during the COVID-19 pandemic, we relate levels of trust in science with government responses to the pandemic and the extent to which populations reduced mobility, a measure identified by epidemiologists as critical to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We used data from the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor to develop a comparable index of trust in science across 144 countries using confirmatory analysis models for categorical data (often referred as Item Response Models) with alignment optimisation. We use this index to provide evidence on the association between trust in science, country level mobility changes following the COVID-19 pandemic and the stringency of regulations to halt COVID-19 spread. We find that trust in science was highest in Nordic European countries, among individuals with high educational attainment and income. Differences by religiosity, gender and residency were less pronounced. Countries where individuals trust science the most enacted less stringent regulations in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic than countries where individuals trust science the least. Irrespective of country-specific trust in science, behaviors such as mobility reductions changed the most in countries with more stringent regulations. Stringent regulations were associated with large reductions in mobility irrespective of levels of trust in science. By contrast, where regulations were less stringent, mobility decreased more in countries with lower levels of trust in science. Many governments are considering relaxing regulations that were put in place following the rapid surge of cases and deaths and the risk that health care systems would be overwhelmed. At the country level, higher levels of trust in science appear to be associated with less voluntary adoption of behaviors that could reduce transmission, such as mobility reductions.",Francesca Borgonovi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-1D3-F4A,20200521,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3109,FALSE,,

The Fear of COVID-19 Familial Infection Scale: Initial Psychometric Examination,"Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has not only a physical health impact but also a psychological toll, which is associated with the social isolation and emotional contagion of fear and anxiety. One of the main factors which influence the increased levels of stress is the fear of COVID-19, and specifically the fear of being infected, and of transmitting the virus to oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family and friends. In this study, a new measure named ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Fear of COVID-19 Familial Infection ScaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â (FCFI) is suggested, and its psychometric properties are tested.

Risk-benefit and cost-utility analysis for COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium: the impact on mental health and wellbeing.,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the benefits and risks of a lockdown in Belgium, with focus on mental health. Consequently, projecting the cost effectiveness of remedial measures. METHODS For benefits; in estimating health savings, we compared Belgium (lockdown) and Sweden (lockdown-light) for COVID-19 related deaths, peak intensive care unit load and peak hospitalisations load. We also calculated the years of life lost (YLL). For risks; we assessed the mental health and wellbeing, using the most common dimensions: anxiety and depression. GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores were extracted from a survey and compared to a similar representative survey in 2018. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated for and we assessed non-COVID-19 related-deaths from excess mortality. Cost-utility analysis was performed with a 1-year time horizon. Hence, considering the Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs), Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and the potential impact providing adequate treatment compared to standard care. RESULTS Lockdown versus lockdown-light gave no COVID-19 related benefits. COVID-19 related risks during lockdown saw an increase of 4,231 deaths; 667 extra ICU admissions on peak day, 3213 extra hospital admissions on peak day and 140 extra non-COVID-19 related deaths. Additionally, 140 extra deaths occured due to a non-COVID-19 cause. 1,034,365 (9,0%) of Belgian population reported increased anxiety and/or depression. Risk-benefit analysis; COVID-19 related deaths yielded an extra 3,145 YLL, total psychological burden of 104,515 (74,025-139,762) DALYs and the total loss of societal value is considered between ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬3.0 billion and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬5.6 billion. Cost-utility analysis; ICER for psychological treatment for depression was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬11,510/QALY gained. In total psychotherapy could create 181,714 (34,134-213,654) QALYs and a 1 year net benefit of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ 5.2 billion. CONCLUSION We found no evidence that a lockdown versus lockdown-light results in less COVID-19 related mortality and morbidity. The Belgian lockdown created an obvious +104,515 (74,025-139,762) DALYs psychological burden in Belgium. Adequate investment in psychological help would provide individual relief and may improve a personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s immunological response.

For each of these topics, the pandemic crisis is creating new work-related challenges, but also presenting various opportunities. The topics discussed herein include occupational health and safety, work-family issues, telecommuting, virtual teamwork, job insecurity, precarious work, leadership, human resources policy, the aging workforce, and careers. This article sets the stage for further discussion of various ways in which IO psychology research and practice can address the impacts of COVID- 19 for work and organizational processes that are affecting workers now and will shape the future of work and organizations in both the short and long term.

When controlling for these variables, an index of health and an index of socio-economic deprivation do not reach statistical significance. (The former result is not so surprising given that the health index is rather crude, and the dependent variable is age-standardised.) The results suggest that COVID-19 mortality is higher in areas with more people per square km and per household, and that black and Asian Britons are at elevated risk of death from COVID-19.",Noah Carl,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F6-419-B4B,20200522,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3115,FALSE,,
Dread in academia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ how COVID-19 affects science and scientists,"We present a brief opinion piece on the potential effects of the coronavirus pandemic on academia. Over 700 academics from around the world were surveyed, which allowed to identify their main concerns: from low-level, like decreased ability to run experiments, complete grants, conference cancellations, to broader, like job stability and income security. We forward some suggestions on what could be done to mitigate the negative effects of the current pandemic, emphasizing that further discussion is needed on how to coordinate the world-wide effort to allow science flourish, and reduce the possible negative effects the pandemic can have.",Piotr Sorokowski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AB-D07-400,20200523,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3116,FALSE,,
The COVID-19 Pandemic Mental Health Crisis Ahead,"Acknowledging COVID-19 as being potentially fatal triggered mental health-related consequences. In the US, the pandemic has highlighted the inadequacies of the mental healthcare system, especially in rural areas, inadequacies that result from lack of awareness and the severe mental health ramifications of COVID-19. Rural areas in the U.S. are particularly susceptible because mental-health resources are scant to start with, telehealth counseling relies on spotty Internet coverage, and COVID-19 has been slower to emerge outside urban centers.",Areen Omary,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C2-CA2-E73,20200523,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3117,FALSE,,
The Effect of the Corona Disaster on Women: lock down and Corona virus from the lens of Social science,"The world is giving more emphasis to look at the effects of coronavirus from the lens of biomedical science. This article, however, tried to look at the effects of coronavirus from the lens of social science. In this article, coronavirus is considered as a devastating natural disaster and intended to know the socio- psychological effects of lockdown and social distancing on the lives of Bangladeshi women. To do this mostly qualitative approach is used. However, quantitative data is also used to supplement the validity of qualitative data. A survey was conducted for quantitative data and a few case studies are for the qualitative data. The findings shows that around 87% respondents believe that people of Bangladesh should not disregard the decision of the government to stop the spread of Coronavirus and 95% of the respondents believe, everyone should follow the instructions of experts in maintaining social distancing to avoid Coronavirus. This research also shows that 87.2% of the respondents are worried of coronavirus due to public health concerns; however, around 60% of respondents also claimed that the lockdown itself made their lives less meaningful, due to negative effects on their economic and social welfare. Finally it is suggested to recruit more psychiatrics and increase the level of social support for depressed women so that they can have more of an equal contribution in society.",Sohela Mustari et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618E-337-AD4,20200523,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3118,FALSE,,
The COVID-19 Pandemic Impacting Household Food Dynamics: A Cross-National Comparison of China and the U.S.,"This cross-national survey-based study examined in real time how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food-centric matters in 1,732 Chinese and 1,547 U.S. households during the stay-at-home directives. Both cohorts reported increased efficiency in use of food, families spending more time cooking and eating together, and more prudent use of food with less waste. Food purchasing patterns shifted from frequent trips to the store to dramatic increases in online ordering. A small proportion (11% Chinese, 2% U.S. respondents) reported clinically significant weight gains of >4.5 kg. Household food insecurity worsened, with large increases in people worrying about or experiencing food shortage. Collective grocery-shopping experience by survey respondents indicated that the functional stability of food supply systems remained steady. All food types were somewhat available, except for noticeably higher prices widely reported by the Chinese cohort. This study offers insights into future food patterns and sheds light on long-term questions for additional research about how people make decisions and food behavioral changes at times of crisis and the consequences thereafter.",Zhengxia Dou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-540-DE8,20200523,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3119,FALSE,,
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the adult population in Bangladesh: A nationwide cross-sectional study,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has imposed threats on both physical and mental health since its outbreak. This study aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. 1,427 respondents were recruited & assessed by DASS-21 measure. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to examine the association of variables. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression was 59.7%, 33.7%, and 57.9%, respectively. Chi-square tests suggest that age, gender, marital status, education, income, residence, and presence of an elderly family member are associated with mental health outcomes. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes.

Mentioning anosmia improves how community pharmacies handle phone call requests during the COVID-19 pandemic: An audit study in Colombia,"We conducted an audit study with 262 community pharmacies from seven municipalities in the Northeast of Colombia. In the study, a simulated client called and described a list of symptoms experienced by her brother, and asked the pharmacist for a recommendation. In our ""common"" condition, the symptoms were headache, sore throat, and fever. In our COVID condition, we added anosmia (i.e., the loss of smell) as a fourth symptom, allowing better discrimination with respect to other diseases. We find that mentioning anosmia induced a more cautious behavior among pharmacists. The probability that pharmacists recommend to register the case in the dedicated emergency line increased from 19.7 to 32.2 percent, whereas the probability that pharmacists make a prescription decreased from 69.7 to 51.5 percent. The seven selected municipalities were drawn from dengue endemic and non-endemic areas.

Wearing face masks strongly confuses counterparts in reading emotions,"Wearing face masks is one of the essential means to prevent the transmission of certain respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. Although acceptance of such masks increases in the Western hemisphere, many people feel that social interaction is affected by wearing a mask. In the present experiment, we tested the impact of face masks on the readability of emotions. The participants (N=41, calculated by an a priori power test; random sample; healthy persons of different ages, 18-87 years) assessed the emotional expressions displayed by twelve different faces. Each face was randomly presented with six different expressions (angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad) while being fully visible or partly covered by a face mask. Lower accuracy and lower confidence in oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own assessment of the displayed emotions indicate that emotional reading was strongly irritated by the presence of a mask. We further detected specific confusion patterns, mostly pronounced in the case of misinterpreting disgusted faces as being angry plus assessing many other emotions (e.g. happy, sad and angry) as neutral.

COVID-19: INDIAÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NEEDS RETHINKING,"COVID-19 is posing challenges larger challenges in terms of human rights including health rights of women and children. Since the mandatory lockdown has been imposed, violence against women is exponentially rising world over. Several countries have enacted special policies, laws and programs to deal with violence against women in homes. However, India which since the 90s has witnessed widening inequalities since the policy of Liberalization, Globalization and Privatization has been introduced, right now is again facing the disastrous impact due to coronavirus. The pandemic is making adverse gender impact in two ways ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1) Middle- or upper-class women facing abuse in homes during the lockdown and 2) Poor women who have no homes or are surviving in slums or those on the roads walking back home or those awaiting in villages for migrant men to come back. The National Commission for Women has reported a rise of 94 percent in complaint cases where women have been abused in their homes during lockdown. Also, another aspect that has not received attention is increasing number of cases where migrant women, along with men, are walking hundreds of miles, some in their advanced stage of pregnancy along with their children, without food. Some are being forced to deliver babies on the roadside while others are receiving the devastating news of migrant men being dead while walking on roads. Deprivation and denial of health and other services to women and children during the COVID crisis is aggravating the disaster. Therefore, almost half a billion women are at risk in India due to the pandemic. Yet, the state has not made any comprehensive COVID response plan to tackle these challenges. Neither any formal statement is being issued to declare domestic violence as an essential service nor plans have been made to support pregnant women workers walking hundreds of miles without food and water with their children. Rather, the state after 40 days of lockdown, while easing down the restrictions, opened the liquor shops as a first step. In doing so, earning revenue is prioritized over genuine serious concerns of women. This is despite of the fact that the womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s movement has shown evidences that consumption of liquor by men is proportional to an increase in incidences of abuse. This essay investigates the gaps in the stateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response in India to the increase in incidents of violence during the lockdown and argues that a robust comprehensive plan is required to address different aspects of violence women are facing in the largest democracy. The government cannot miss the chance to protect women from violence. In order to imagine a gender just violence-free world, the need is to impose the lockdown on the collective imagination that reiterate gender-stereotypical notions and to put the viruses of patriarchy and poverty in quarantine and isolation forever. By maintaining social distancing with the misogynist ideas and developing a plan to eliminate inequalities in all forms, gender justice and human rights could be achieved and the rights guaranteed under Article 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution can be reclaimed.",Shalu Nigam,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E0-D57-D24,20200525,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3123,FALSE,,

The Science of Wisdom in a Polarized World: Knowns and Unknowns,"Interest in wisdom in the cognitive sciences, psychology, and education has been paralleled by conceptual confusions about its nature and assessment. To clarify these issues and promote consensus in the field, wisdom researchers met in Toronto in July of 2019, resolving disputes through discussion. Guided by a survey of scientists who study wisdom-related constructs, we established a common wisdom model, observing that empirical approaches to wisdom converge on the morally-grounded application of metacognition to reasoning and problem-solving. After outlining the function of relevant metacognitive and moral processes, we critically evaluate existing empirical approaches to measurement and offer recommendations for best practices. In the subsequent sections, we use the common wisdom model to selectively review evidence about the role of individual differences for development and manifestation of wisdom, approaches to wisdom development and training, as well as cultural, subcultural, and social-contextual differences.

Psychological Well-Being Under Conditions of Lockdown: An Experience Sampling Study in Austria During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and attendant lockdown measures present serious threats to psychological well-being worldwide. Here, we examined the extent to which being outdoors (versus indoors), the experience of loneliness, and screen-time are associated with psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic using an experiencing sampling method. In April 2020, Austrian adults (N = 286, age M = 31.0 years) completed a 21-day experience sampling phase in which they reported their psychological well-being, whether they were indoors or outdoors, and loneliness at three random time-points each day, as well as their daily screen-time. Results indicated that being outdoors was associated with higher psychological well-being, whereas greater loneliness and greater daily screen-time were associated with poorer well-being. Additionally, the impact of loneliness on well-being was weaker when participants were outdoors than indoors. Temporal changes in well-being, loneliness, and screen-time across the 21 days were small. These results have health policy implications for the promotion of population well-being during pandemics.",Stefan Stieger et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-B4C-164,20200526,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3126,FALSE,,
"Explaining Compliance with Social Distancing Norms during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Roles of Cultural Orientations, Trust and Self-Conscious Emotions in the US, Italy, and South Korea","The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented health crisis. Many governments around the world have responded by implementing lockdown measures of different degrees of intensity. To be effective, such measures must rely on citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ compliance and collaboration. In the present study (N = 1896), we examined predictors of compliance with social distancing norms, and intentions to disclose the disease to authorities and acquaintances/friends, in the US, Italy and South Korea. We investigated the role of cultural orientations of horizontal and vertical individualism and collectivism, trust in the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s action, and self-conscious emotions of shame and guilt related to the disease. Across countries, vertical collectivism predicted stronger shame whereas horizontal collectivism predicted stronger trust in the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s action. Only in the US, vertical collectivism was associated with stronger trust. Subsequently, shame predicted lower compliance and intentions to disclose the disease, guilt was associated with stronger intentions to disclose the disease to the authorities, and trust was associated with stronger compliance and intentions to disclose the disease to authorities. Unlike Italy and South Korea, the association between trust on compliance was not statistically significant in the US, Implications of the findings, and directions for future research are discussed.",Giovanni A.

A rapid review of the impact of quarantine and restricted environments on childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play and health outcomes,"In the wake of the current COVID-19 health crisis, there is uncertainty and concern about the impact this pandemic will have on childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s health and educational outcomes. Play is a fundamental part of childhood and can be integral to childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s health in moments of crisis. Due to severe lockdown regulations around the world, typical play experiences have needed to adapt to school and playground closures, changes to peer interactions, and social distancing. We undertook a rapid literature review of the impact of quarantine, isolation, or other restrictive environments on childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s play and whether play may mitigate the adverse effects of such restrictions. Fifteen peer-reviewed studies were identified, spanning various environments in which children faced restriction, including hospitalisation, juvenile and immigration detention, and displacement to a refugee camp. We found that the literature provided evidence of changes in childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s access to play under restrictive circumstances, but less conclusive inferences regarding changes in frequency of play behaviours. These studies also indicated ways in which play might support children going through periods of isolation or quarantine, via promoting coping, expression, sociability, and skill development, but critically lacked robust investigations of play as a mechanism or intervention target in mitigating the negative impacts of restriction during childhood. Studies pertaining to children in isolation due to infectious disease outbreaks were notably absent from the literature reviewed in this search.

Household air pollution and COVID-19 risk in India: A potential concern,"One in every two Indian households continues to rely on highly-polluting solid fuels to meet their cooking and other energy demands. Recent evidence demonstrates that people suffering from preconditions associated with air pollution and those with short-term exposures to air pollution are highly susceptible to the novel Coronavirus infection and associated morbidity and mortality. And as for many Indians, especially those with pre-existing health conditions and the elderly, home-based isolation and confinement practices are likely to continue to prevent the infection, exposure to household air pollution may render such population groups more susceptible to COVID-19. This warrants caution and demands immediate and specific actions; which are discussed.

Social Distancing as a Health Behavior: County-level Movement in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic is Associated with Conventional Health Behaviors,"Background: Social distancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âwhen people reduce their physical movement and limit social contacts beyond their immediate householdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âis a primary intervention available to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The importance of social distancing is unlikely to change until effective treatments or vaccines become widely available. However, relatively little is known about how best to promote social distancing. Applying knowledge from social and behavioral research on conventional health behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity) to support social distancing public health efforts and research is promising, but empirical evidence supporting this approach is needed. Purpose: We examined whether one type of social distancing behaviorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âreductions in movement outside the homeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âwas associated with conventional health behaviors. Method: We examined the association between GPS-derived movement behavior in 2,858 counties in United States from March 1st to April 7th, 2020 and the prevalence of county-level indicators influenced by residentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ conventional health behaviors. Results: Changes in movement were associated with conventional health behaviors, and the magnitude of these associations were similar to the associations among the conventional health behaviors. Counties with healthier behaviorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âparticularly less obesity and greater physical activityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âevidenced greater decreases in movement outside the home during the initial phases of the pandemic in the United States.

The association of UV with rates of COVID-19 transmission and deaths in Mexico: the possible mediating role of vitamin D.,"The first COVID-19 case in Mexico was confirmed on 26 February 2020 and by May 3 the number of registered cases had risen to 30,927. However the rate of transmission varied greatly from city to city. We used data on temperature, humidity and ultraviolet radiation (UV) from 45 cities all over the country to explore whether there was an association between these variables and rates of transmission and rates of accumulation of COVID-19 ascribed deaths. The advantage of an in-country study of this kind is that many of the variables that can confound international studies are held constant (e.g. public health policies, methods of reporting, cultural, behavioural and genetic factors). Although the official statistics undoubtedly greatly underestimate the situation in Mexico due to lack of testing, they are underestimated in all cities so this should not introduce bias across the sample. We found that temperature and humidity had no discernible association with transmission rates but that UV during the transmission period was negatively correlated with rates of transmission, suggesting a sterilizing effect. UV in the January preceding the epidemic had a slightly higher association with transmission rates than UV during the transmission period itself. We also found negative associations of UV in the transmission period and in January with rate of cumulative deaths, but at lower levels of statistical significance. We conclude that in addition to a sterilizing effect during the transmission period, UV may have a physiological effect in reducing transmission and deaths due to COVID-19, most likely through the medium of vitamin D production in the body. This follows the growing body of medical evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with severity of COVID-19. However, we also found a negative correlation between altitude and rates of COVID-19 transmission, distinct and independent of the UV effect, which may indicate that other physiological processes are also present. In a multiple regression, altitude and UV together accounted for 18% of the variation in transmission rates between cities.",Margaret Skutsch et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46011-A7C-48E,20200526,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3131,FALSE,,
Evaluation of the English version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its relationship with behavior change and political beliefs,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has many individuals around the world fearing for their lives. The constant news coverage, rapid transmission, and relatively high mortality rate, make fearfulness a natural response. To assess the fear of COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was developed. The primary aim of the present study is to conduct the first psychometric assessment and validation of the English version of the FCV-19S. Methods: Two samples were collected in New Zealand. Sample 1 comprised 1,624 participants of which 1,397 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Sample 2 comprised 1,111 participants of which 1,023 completed all questions and were used in the analyses. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain the scaleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reliability and validity. Results: Across both samples, the FCV-19S had high internal consistency. Consistent with the earlier validation studies, the FCV-19S displayed a moderately strong relationship with the perceived infectability and germ aversion subscales of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS). Furthermore, FCV-19S scores were negatively correlated with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) scores. With respect to the motivating role of fear, there was a significant relationship between FCV-19S scores and adherence to the lockdown rules that were implemented in New Zealand. Finally, consistent with recent reports on the politicization of the COVID-19 pandemic, an exploratory question found that participants who rated themselves as more conservative tended to report lower FCV-19S scores. Conclusion: The English version of the COVID-19S is a sound unidimensional scale with robust psychometric properties and can be used with confidence among English-speaking populations.",Taylor Winter et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-BD8-391,20200526,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3132,FALSE,,
Microdosing as a response to the meaning crisis,"Background: The use of psychedelic substances like LSD and magic mushrooms in research and to treat mental health conditions has been increasing in the last decade. In particular, the practice of microdosing ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ using sub-hallucinogenic amounts of psychedelics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ has been increasing (Anderson et al., 2019), but large-scale systemic qualitative analyses are still scant. Aims: This study attempted to recognize emergent themes in qualitative reports regarding the experience of microdosing so as to enrich the theoretical landscape in psychedelics research and propose future research directions for both basic and clinical research. Methods: This study used qualitative analysis to analyze free-text responses from individuals who participated in an online survey disseminated on various social media platforms. Participants had reported microdosing at least once in the past year. Results: Data from 118 informative responses suggested four main emergent themes: reasons for microdosing, the practice of microdosing, outcomes linked to microdosing, and meta-commentary about microdosing. Participants mostly reported microdosing for clinical reasons and to improve productivity, and mentioned that the practice is often challenging due to unknown optimal dosing regimen. The outcomes of microdosing varied widely between strong endorsement of the practice and disappointment at the lack of effect. Meta-commentary included warning against overexcitement with the practice. We couch our findings in meaning-making theory and propose that, even at low doses, psychedelic substances can provide a sense of meaning currently lacking in Western culture. Conclusion: Our results suggest that there many of the reported benefits occur regardless of motivation to microdose and are likely due to the enhanced psychological flexibility and sense of connectedness made possible due to the use of psychedelics. Double-blind, placebo controlled experiments are required in order to substantiate these reports.",Rotem Petranker et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46166-BAD-C5E,20200527,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3133,FALSE,,

First-person experience of life-threatening and stressful events can modify individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ risk perception, and, consequently, risk-taking behaviours. Here we investigated risk-taking profiles in 130 Italian residents, and compared healthcare to non-healthcare workers, during the lockdown phase. We ad hoc developed the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCovid-19 Risk TaskÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, including the classic monetary Holt-Laury Paired Lottery Task (Monetary Condition, MC) and two new ecological conditions exploring Covid-19 related risk-taking aptitudes in relation to different health (Health Status Condition, HsC) and employment (Employment Status Condition, EsC) outcomes. Results showed that, in the whole sample, individuals were more risk-averse in MC than in HsC and EsC. Moreover, a payoff increase produced a shift toward more risk-averse behaviours in MC, but not in HsC and EsC, where we found an opposite trend suggesting a more risk-loving behaviour.

"Coronavirus Stress, Optimism-Pessimism, Psychological Inflexibility, and Psychological Health: Psychometric Properties of the Coronavirus Stress Measure","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a global health threat attributed to negatively affecting the mental health and well-being of people globally. The purpose of the present study is to examine the mediating role of optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility in the relationship of coronavirus stress with psychological problems among Turkish adults. The sample of the study included 451 adults (55% women). Participants mainly consisted of young adults with a mean age of 23.30 years, ranging from 18 to 65 years (SD= 6.97). A mediation model indicated that coronavirus stress had a significant predictive effect on optimism-pessimism, psychological inflexibility, and psychological problems. Further, optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility mediated the effect of coronavirus stress on psychological problems in adults. Lastly, optimism-pessimism predicted the psychological problems of adults through psychological inflexibility. These results elucidate our understanding of the role of mediators in coronavirus stress and psychological health problems. The findings are useful in terms of providing evidence for tailoring interventions and implementing preventative approaches to mitigate the psychopathological consequences of COVID-19. Based on the present findings, the potential utility of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is discussed within the context of COVID-19.",GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶kmen Arslan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46154-8CC-1F0,20200527,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3136,FALSE,,

Epidemiology of mental health problems in COVID-19: a review,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a pandemic affecting health and wellbeing globally. In addition to the physical health, economic, and social implications, the psychological impacts of this pandemic are increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. This narrative review reflected on scholarly articles on the epidemiology of mental health problems in COVID-19. The current literature suggests that people affected by COVID-19 may have a high burden of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attack, irrational anger, impulsivity, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal behavior. Moreover, several factors associated with mental health problems in COVID-19 are found, which include age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income, place of living, close contact with people with COVID-19, comorbid physical and mental health problems, exposure to COVID-19 related news and social media, coping styles, stigma, psychosocial support, health communication, confidence in health services, personal protective measures, risk of contracting COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of survival. Furthermore, the epidemiological distribution of mental health problems and associated factors were heterogeneous among the general public, COVID-19 patients, and healthcare providers. The current evidence suggests that a psychiatric epidemic is cooccurring with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates the attention of the global health community. Future epidemiological studies should emphasize on psychopathological variations and temporality of mental health problems in different populations. Nonetheless, multipronged interventions should be developed and adopted to address the existing psychosocial challenges and promote mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",Mahbub Hossain et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612B-BA9-71C,20200527,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3138,FALSE,,
Immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the socio-emotional and digital skills of Japanese children,"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has spread widely throughout the world. To reduce the spread of infection, children are prevented from going to school and have fewer opportunities for in-person communication. Although the pandemic has impacted the everyday lives of children, its impact on their development is unknown. This pre-registered study compared Japanese childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s socio-emotional skills and skills for operating digital devices before and during the pandemic. Parents completed a web-based questionnaire before and during the pandemic for children ages 0-9. The results indicated that during the pandemic, children were more prosocial, experienced more problems in their peer relationships, and had better digital skills, but no differences were found in emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity between before and during the pandemic. The change in digital skills was mediated by the duration of childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s media use. Overall, our results suggest the pandemic may have immediate impact on childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s socio-emotional and digital skills.",Yusuke Moriguchi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-A2A-D6D,20200528,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3139,FALSE,,
"Social participation, inclusion and mental well-being following SARS-CoV-2 related lockdown restrictions in adults with and without mental disorders. Results from a follow-up study in Germany","Objectives: In Germany, as in many other countries, several lockdown restrictions were put in place with the aim of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. This study investigated the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the related lockdown restrictions on opportunities for social participation, social inclusion and psychological well-being for adults with and without mental disorders within a follow-up study based on pre- and post-lockdown assessments. Methods: Study participants (n=132) were assigned to one of three groups, depending on the mental health status at the initial survey. Parameters of interest were assessed using the Measure of Participation and Social Inclusion for Use in People with a Chronic Mental Disorder (F-INK), the Index for the Assessment of Health Impairments (IMET), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). Results: The impact on opportunities for social participation and social participation considerably differed depending on the participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mental health status at the first assessment. Independent of this, we found no detrimental effects on the psychological well-being of participants four weeks after the implementation of lockdown restrictions.

Reframing the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak through a social media community for students,"The COVID-19 outbreak and the restrictions that have been enforced by the health authorities are having a profound psychological impact on the population. Many people, including the students, faced forced modifications to their daily lives and this prompted the need for scalable strategies to promote resilience. We designed an online community intervention for psychology students and recent alumni aimed to promote functional coping strategies through openness and cognitive flexibility. This psycho-educational intervention was delivered through a private group on social media (Facebook) and it involved the publication of exercises and quick lectures. Contents were posted regularly and people from the community were invited to share their comments. The posts included stimuli that promote open and flexible reflections on the current situation. The overall aim of this group was a cognitive reframing on the epidemic effects, promoting creative and flexible thinking. We ran a thematic analysis of the interactions, and we collected qualitative feedback at the end of the intervention. The participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ comments dealt with changes in their perspectives, sharing discomfort, encouragement and support, and building a sense of community. Post-intervention comments were highly satisfied and confirmed the helpfulness of the stimuli to promote flexibility and openness, eventually helping to manage the negative emotions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. This study provides preliminary evidence that an online psycho-educational community stimulating flexibility and openness can help to reframe the negative psychological impact of the outbreak, improving their management.",Francesco Pagnini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461E5-1C6-7D5,20200528,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3142,FALSE,,
The French publicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attitudes to a future COVID-19 vaccine: the politicization of a public health issue,"As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 flu illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N=5,018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis but oppose people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Jeremy Keith Ward et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4622F-295-944,20200528,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3143,FALSE,,
When Private Optimism meets Public Despair: Dissociable effects on behavior and well-being,"When faced with a threat, peoplesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ estimate of risk guides their response. When danger is to the self as well as to others two estimates are generated: the risk to oneself and the risk to others. As these estimates likely differ, it is unclear how exactly they drive a response. To answer this question, we studied a large representative sample of Americans facing the COVID-19 pandemic at two time points (N1=1145, N2=683). We discover a paradoxical duality: a tendency to be optimistic about oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own risk of infection (private optimism) while at the same time to be pessimistic about the risk to others (public pessimism). These two estimates were found to be differentially related to affect and choice. First, private optimism, but not public pessimism, was associated with peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s positive feelings. The association between private optimism and positive affect was mediated by peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sense of agency over their future. However, negative affect was related to both private risk perception and public risk perception. Second, people predominantly engaged in protective behaviors based on their estimated risk to the population rather than to themselves. This suggests that people were predominantly engaging in protective behaviors for the benefit of others. The findings are important for understanding how peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beliefs about their own future and that of others are related to protective behaviors and well-being.",Laura K.

Using Decision Aids to Support Self-Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Self-isolation is a vital element of efforts to contain COVID-19. We report an online experiment with a nationally representative sample (N=500) that tested behaviourally informed decision aids to support self-isolation. The experiment had three stages that tested interventions designed to help individuals to: (i) decide whether they need to self-isolate; (ii) be confident in their ability to self-isolate should they need to; and (iii) manage a household in which an individual needs to self-isolate. Relative to prevailing public health advice, displaying decision trees improved participantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ decisions about when self-isolation was necessary, although they systematically underestimated the need to self-isolate in the presence of less common COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. sore throat, fatigue). Interaction with an online planning tool increased confidence about coping with self-isolation among adults aged under 40. Presenting advice in the form of infographics improved recall and comprehension of how to manage self-isolation. The study demonstrates how public health policy can benefit from behavioural pre-testing of interventions.",Peter D.

"Looking out for Myself: Exploring the Relationship Between Conspiracy Mentality, Perceived Personal Risk and COVID-19 Prevention Measures","Objectives. This research examined how conspiracy mentality may affect compliance with preventive health measures necessary to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and the underlying motivations to comply. Design and Method. We conducted two cross-sectional studies (Study 1 N = 762, Study 2 N = 229) on a French population, measuring conspiracy mentality, compliance with preventive health measures, and perceived risks related to COVID-19. We also measured motivations to comply with preventive measures in Study 2. Results. We show that people high in conspiracy mentality are likely to engage in non-normative prevention behaviours (Study 1), but are less willing to comply with extreme preventive behaviours that are government-driven (Study 2). However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non-normative prevention behaviours. Conclusions. Our studies showcase how people high in conspiracy theorizing may (dis)engage with prevention behaviours, but that perceived risk and motivation to protect oneself could increase these individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ compliance.",GaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«lle Marinthe et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46180-D69-D93,20200529,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3146,FALSE,,

Female gender, feeling no control of the situation and reporting dissatisfaction with the response of the state during the COVID- 19 pandemic, and reduced interaction with family and friends increased the worsening of pre-existing psychiatric conditions, whereas optimism, ability to share concerns with family and friends and using social media like usual were associated with less worsening.

Method: In a cross-sectional, general population survey conducted from March 18 to April 4, 2020, U.S. adults (n=10,625) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels using quota sampling methods. Results: Life stressors, probable depression, past-month suicide ideation, and past-month suicide attempts were not elevated among participants subject to state-level stay-at-home orders and/or large gatherings bans. Multiple life stressors were associated with increased rates of probable depression. Past-month suicide ideation was significantly higher among participants reporting ongoing arguments with a partner and serious legal problems. Past-month suicide attempt was significantly higher among participants reporting concerns about a life-threatening illness or injury, but was significantly lower among participants reporting an unexpected bill or expense.

The COVID-19 Pandemic and Sexual Behavior among Gay and Bisexual Men in the United States,"After decades of navigating HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, gay and bisexual men are again responding to new and uncertain risks presented by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic by adapting aspects of their sexual behavior. We fielded a survey of LGBTQ AmericansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic collected from April 10 to May 10, 2020, an important time period during which most states issued stay-at-home orders (April 10 to April 30) and also began implementing phased reopening (May 1 to May 10). In this paper, we limit analyses to a subsample of 728 gay and bisexual men and focus on changes to sexual behavior in response to the pandemic. We find that many gay and bisexual men made significant changes to their sexual behavior and partner selection. Nine out of 10 men in our sample reported having either one sexual partner or no sexual partner in the last 30 days, which, for many, was a substantial decrease compared to just before the pandemic. Men also made changes to the kinds of partners they had and their sexual activities with partners (e.g., more virtual sex), engaged in new strategies to reduce their risks of infection from partners, and expressed high levels of concern about how HIV may affect COVID-19 risk, treatment, and recovery. We expect these changes to be important not only for reducing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but also for reducing new sexually transmitted infections. Despite substantial changes in sexual behavior for most men in our sample, we note concerns around the sustainability of sexual behavior change over time and nondisclosure of COVID-19 symptoms to partners.",Tara Mckay et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461B9-B8B-E64,20200530,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3150,FALSE,,

And how it also leads to long-term stress which causes cardiovascular disease, and other health problems like obesity. Emerging evidence shows that these influences reach into all aspects of health-related outcomes. But these ethnic disparities in experiences of the pandemic are not being given sufficient attention.

"Assessing concerns for the economic consequence of the COVID-19 response and mental health problems associated with economic vulnerability and negative economic shock in Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom","Currently, many different countries are under lockdown or extreme social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19. The potentially far-reaching side effects of these measures have not yet been fully understood. In this study we analyse the results of a multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=3,504), Spain (N=3,524) and the United Kingdom (N=3,523), with two separate analyses. In the first analysis, we examine the elicitation of citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ concerns over the downplaying of the economic consequences of the lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We control for Social Desirability Bias through a list experiment included in the survey. In the second analysis, we examine the data from the same survey to estimate the consequences of the economic lockdown in terms of mental health, by predicting the level of stress, anxiety and depression associated with being economically vulnerable and having been affected by a negative economic shock. To accomplish this, we have used a prediction algorithm based on machine learning techniques. To quantify the size of this affected population, we compare its magnitude with the number of people affected by COVID-19 using measures of susceptibility, vulnerability and behavioural change collected in the same questionnaire. We find that the concern for the economy and for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe way outÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â of the lockdown is diffuse and there is evidence of minor underreporting. Additionally, we estimate that around 42.8% of the populations in the three countries are at high risk of stress, anxiety and depression, based on their level of economic vulnerability and their exposure to a negative economic shock. Therefore, it can be concluded that the lockdown and extreme social distancing in the three countries has had an enormous impact on individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ mental health and this should be taken into account for future decisions made on regulations concerning the pandemic.",Cristiano Codagnone et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C6-510-392,20200530,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3152,FALSE,,

Models and methods to analyse the interaction of evidence and policy in the first 100 days of the UK government's response to COVID-19,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is both a global health crisis, and a civic emergency for national governments, including the UK. With currently no vaccine and no treatment, there is no medical solution. Consequently, the questions for evidence and policy are complex, draw on multiple streams, and are about management rather than medicine. This working paper sets out models and methods for a forthcoming study to analyse the interaction of evidence and policy in the first 100 days of the UK governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s response to COVID-19. MODELS Drawing on chaos theory and insights from the policy sciences, three models of evidence-based policy are discussed: a linear cipher model, a multiple streams model, and a melee model. The nonlinear melee model is adopted for the forthcoming study, in which multiple forms of evidence (science, economic, political, social) and actors interact in real time, and supposedly independent evidence streams concomitantly consider evidence from other streams, creating an apparently chaotic melee in which it is unclear where, how and by whom decisions originate or are made. This is normal, and much closer to how policy decisions emerge than the process represented by rational, ideal-type, linear models. METHODS DESIGN: An analysis of evidence in and of the policy response to COVID-19 by the UK government for the 100 days from 1st February 2020 to 11th May 2020 will be undertaken. DATA: Three data sources will be accessed: papers from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and its feeder groups and committees; formal government statements, information and guidance; BBC News coverage of government press briefings and further documents and/or coverage snowballing from them. ANALYSIS: A thematic content analysis, pre-structured by the four evidence streams in the melee model, will be undertaken to identify critical incidents for a strict contemporaneous analysis using only information available at the time of the incident, and referring only to the contemporaneous context for the incident. ASSUMPTIONS: Illustrative critical incidents will be sufficient to provide evidence for the explanatory utility of the melee model. Comprehensive coverage of all incidents would unnecessarily super-saturate the analysis.",Mike Weed,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CA-C6F-98A,20200530,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3156,FALSE,,

Earlier reports have shown that anxiety over the novel coronavirus may predict mental functioning during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the links between persistent thinking about COVID-19, anxiety over SARS-CoV-2 and trauma effects. For the purpose of this study, the Polish adaptation of the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale (OCS) was implemented. Participants and procedure. The study involved 356 individuals aged 18ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“78 (58% females). In addition to OCS, the participants completed the following questionnaires: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale and the Short Form of the Changes in Outlook Questionnaire. Results. OCS was characterized by satisfactory psychometric properties (ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â± = .82). Regression analysis indicated that persistent thinking about COVID-19 was associated with increased coronavirus anxiety and negative trauma effects. In addition, anxiety served as a partial mediator in the link between persistent thinking about COVID-19 and negative trauma effects. Conclusions. The data obtained suggest that persistent thinking about the pandemic may be dysfunctional for mental health during the spread of the infectious disease.",Sebastian Skalski et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-8FD-7AD,20200530,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3158,FALSE,,
"Determinants of preventive behaviors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in France: comparing the sociocultural, psychosocial and social cognitive explanations.","In absence of effective pharmaceutical treatments, the individualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s compliance with a series of behavioral recommendations provided by the public health authorities play a critical role in the control and prevention of SARS-CoV2 infection. However, we still do not know much about the rate and determinants of adoption of the recommended health behaviors. This paper examines the compliance with the main behavioral recommendations, and compares sociocultural, psychosocial and social cognitive explanations for its variation in the French population. Based on the current literature, these 3 categories of factors were identified as potential determinants of individual differences in the health preventive behaviors. The data used for these analyses are drawn from 2 cross-sectional studies (N ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 2,000) conducted after the lockdown and before the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. The participants were drawn from a larger internet consumer panel where recruitment was stratified to generate a socio-demographically representative sample of the French adult population. Overall, the results show a very high rate of compliance with the behavioral recommendations among the participants. A series of linear regression analyses were then performed to assess the potential explanatory power of these approaches in complying with these recommendations by successively including sociocultural factors, psychosocial factors, social cognitive factors, and then all factors, in the model. Only the inclusion of the cognitive variables substantially increased the explained variance of the self-reported adoption of preventive behaviors, providing better support for the social cognitive than the sociocultural and psychosocial explanations.",Jocelyn Raude,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B1-3A8-F78,20200531,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3159,FALSE,,
Development and validation of the Japanese version Fear of COVID-19 Scale among adolescents.,"Exploring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of adolescents is urgently needed. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a Japanese-version Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) among adolescents. Japanese adolescents administered the Japanese-version FCV-19S, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS). Statistical analyses revealed that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a two-factor model consisting of an emotional-responses and physiological-responses factor, as well as high reliability (emotional: ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â± = .71; physiological: ÃƒÅ½Ã‚Â± = .82). Constructive validity was shown by the significant positive correlation between the GAD-7 and emotional (r = .11) and physiological response (r = .25), between PHQ-A and physiological response (r = .19), and between both factors and the PVDS subscale (rs > .16). These results indicate that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a high internal consistency and moderately good construct validity.",Akihiro Masuyama et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C5-7D4-72F,20200601,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3160,FALSE,,
Feeling Positive About Reopening? New Normal Scenarios from COVID-19 Reopen Sentiment Analytics,"The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research identifies public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research focuses on emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to the COVID-19 reopening debate, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more positive sentiment support, than negative, for reopening the US economy. This research develops a novel sentiment polarity based four scenarios framework, which will remain useful for future crisis analysis, well beyond COVID-19. With additional validation, this research stream could present valuable time sensitive opportunities for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide local and regional communities, and the nation into a successful new normal future.",Jim Samuel et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-00E-117,20200601,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3161,FALSE,,
Financial Incentives for Downloading COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“19 Digital Contact Tracing Apps,"Contact tracing is a key approach for controlling the COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“19 pandemic. Traditional tracing methods might however miss a number of contacts between infected and susceptible persons. Digital contact tracing apps have been developed to assist health departments in notifying individuals of recent exposures to SARS-CoV-2. These apps are used in several countries throughout the world, and some US states have either launched or are planning to launch such apps. The potential effects of digital contact tracing apps depend however on their widespread adoption. Most investigations of the determinants of adoption among potential users have focused on issues related to privacy features (e.g., who can access data, whether location is recorded) and the accuracy of the app in notifying users of exposures to SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., false notifications). In this paper, we investigate whether financial incentives might help further accelerate the adoption of digital contact tracing apps. We conducted a discrete choice experiment with an online sample of 394 US residents aged 18ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“69 years old. We asked participants to make a series of choices between two hypothetical versions of a digital contact tracing app characterized by several randomly selected attributes, including varying levels of financial cost or incentives to download. In this experiment, financial incentives were more than twice as important in the decision-making process about DCT app downloads than privacy and accuracy. In order to accelerate adoption, US States planning to launch digital contact tracing apps should consider offering financial incentives for download to potential users.",Jemima A.

Who Is the Most Stressed During COVID-19 Isolation? Data From 27 Countries,"To limit the rapid spread of COVID-19, countries have asked their citizens to stay at home. As a result, demographic and cultural factors related to home life became especially relevant to predicting population well-being during isolation. This pre-registered worldwide study analyses the relationship between the number of adults and children in a household, marital status, age, gender, individualism-collectivism and perceived stress. We used the COVIDiSTRESS Global Survey data of 54,245 online participants from 27 countries. The data was collected worldwide between March 30 and April 6, 2020. Our results provide evidence that higher levels of stress are associated with younger age, being a woman, being single, staying with more children, and living in collectivistic cultures. We discuss our findings by emphasizing the need for the public health to focus on both physical and psychological well-being of these groups, as they may be especially susceptible to experiencing elevated levels of stress.",Marta Kowal et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-166-ABC,20200601,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3163,FALSE,,
Disparate Impact Pandemic Framing Decreases Public Concern For Health Consequences,"It is known that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) is disproportionately affecting the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, and the poor.

This study answers this question using a novel survey experiment and finds that emphasis on the unequal aspect of the pandemic, especially as it relates to the elderly and those with medical conditions, could be causing the public to become less concerned about the outbreak and its human toll. Discussion situates this finding in the literature on scientific communication and persuasion and explains why language that emphasizes the impact of the virus on all of us -- rather than singling out certain groups -- could be more effective in increasing caution among the general public and make them take the situation more seriously.",Ugur Yildirim,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46011-94B-63E,20200602,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3164,FALSE,,
Negative shocks predict change in cognitive function and preferences: Assessing the negative affect and stress hypothesis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown mitigation strategy,"In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, households throughout the world have to cope with negative shocks, either because of the disease or the various mitigation strategies that have caused massive unemployment and financial insecurity. Previous research has shown that negative shocks impair cognitive function and change risk, time and social preferences. In this study, we analyze the results of a longitudinal multi-country survey conducted in Italy (N=1,652), Spain (N=1,660) and the United Kingdom (N=1,578). We measure cognitive function using the Cognitive Reflection Test and preferences traits using an experimentally validated set of questions to assess the differences between people exposed to a shock compared to the rest of the sample. We measure four possible types of shocks: labor market shock, health shock, occurrence of stressful events, and mental health shock. Additionally, we randomly assign participants to groups with either a recall of negative events (more specifically, a mild reinforcement of stress or of fear/anxiety), or to a control group (to recall neutral or joyful memories), in order to assess whether or not stress and negative emotions drive a change in preferences. Results show that people affected by shocks performed worse in terms of cognitive functioning, are more risk loving, and are more prone to punish others (negative reciprocity). Data do not support the hypotheses that the result is driven by stress or by negative emotions.",Francesco Bogliacino et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BA-CF1-684,20200602,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3165,FALSE,,
Psychological responses during the COVID-19 outbreak among university students in Bangladesh,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many individuals, including university students typically at a developmental stage of emerging adulthood, and facing disruptions to their education. University students may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health sequelae of the current COVID-19-related lockdown in Bangladesh. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh early in the COVID-19 outbreak. An internet-based survey was conducted from April 11 to April 24, 2020, involving 3,122 Bangladeshi university students aged 18 to 29 years (59.5% males; mean age 21.4Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±2 years). After providing informed consent, participants completed an internet-based survey assessing socio-demographic and personal lifestyle-related measures. The DASS-21 scale assessed depression, anxiety, and stress symptomatology. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and stress were 62.9%, 63.6%, and 58.6%, respectively. These rates tended to be higher than in previous surveys in the student population, particularly for the dimensions of stress and depression. Also, the pattern of associations with risk and demographic variables had shifted compared to previous work, suggesting situational impact on these. Depression, anxiety, and stress were prevalent among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic situation in April 2020 in Bangladesh. Although a causal relationship cannot be established, the findings suggest that monitoring and support programs may be useful to help students cope with the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.",Saiful Islam et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46026-F74-D3D,20200602,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3166,FALSE,,
Why has the COVID-19 pandemic increased support for Universal Basic Income?,"The 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic has led to a marked increase in positive discussion of Universal Basic Income (UBI) in political and media circles. However, we do not know whether there has been a corresponding increase in support for the policy in the public at large, or why. Here, we present two studies carried out in April and May 2020 in UK and US samples. In study 1 (n=802), we find that people express much stronger support for a UBI policy for the times of the pandemic and its aftermath than for normal times. This is largely explained by the increased importance they attach to a system that is simple and efficient to administer, and that reduces stress and anxiety in society. In study 2 (n=400), we pit UBI against an equally-generous but targeted social transfer system. We find that, for pandemic times, support shifts towards UBI. This is partially explained by a number of perceived advantages, such as simplicity of administration and suitability for a changing world. Our results illustrate how a changing social and economic situation can bring about marked shifts in policy preferences, through changes in citizenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perceptions of what is currently important.",Daniel Nettle et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600A-4F1-212,20200602,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3167,FALSE,,

Earlier studies on the topic are based on cross-sectional data with different survey designs and sample selections. - Women undertake the major share of housework and childcare and form 80% of the health and social care workers who are more exposed to the virus, among people aged between 20 to 49. - There was a 30% reduction in paid work time for both women and men, and the percentage was 45% among non-key workers. Women and men experienced a similar amount (3-4 hours) of an increase in weekly housework hours. We also note a comparable reduction in monthly labour income for women and men. - Women, especially mothers experienced a more dramatic decline in well-being amid the COVID pandemic. - Single mothers fare the worst in the labour market, are the least likely to own a house, have a car in the household, and have the highest risk of depression, which makes them particularly vulnerable in the current circumstances. Single parents experience the largest 7% increase in the non-working rates during the lockdown period. - Childcare support is critical when the usual support networks, such as grandparents, friends, and neighbours, can no longer help with childcare, especially for mothers.",Muzhi Zhou et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-E6A-042,20200602,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3169,FALSE,,
Longitudinal changes in the outdoor recreation communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic: Final report on a three-phase national survey of outdoor enthusiasts,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to alter daily life and lead to changes in the way we spend time outside. In an effort to gather timely and relevant data on national recreation patterns, the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and its academic partner, Pennsylvania State University, have been working to conduct a study that can offer guidance to land managers, recreation providers, and outdoor enthusiasts across the United States. Through three phases of survey-based data collection, ranging from April 9th to May 21st, 2020, a longitudinal perspective of how outdoor recreationists are reacting to the COVID-19 pandemic was developed from this research. The timing of this research was purposeful, as it intended to capture self-reported information related to outdoor recreation and COVID-19 during periods of time when the virus had been officially documented as a pandemic, resulting federal and state stay-at-home orders were implemented across the U.S., and many parks and protected closed or discontinued regular operations. Phases 1 and 2 of this assessment were detailed by previous reports. This report details the findings across all three phases of research. These findings track behaviors, psychosocial determinants of outdoor recreation decision-making, and future intentions across the study period. This report is intended to provide valuable information for managing the changing recreation use of public lands, predicting spikes in recreation, and offering insight for land managers as they work to protect the natural world.

A short-form version of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale: Initial development of the IUS-5,"Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is an individualÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s ""tendency to be bothered or upset by the (as yet) unknown elements of a situation, whether the possible outcome is negative or not."" This construct, originally proposed in the context of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), is now considered a transdiagnostic construct. The Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS; Freeston, RhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©aume, Letarte, Dugas, & Ladouceur, 1994) has been the gold standard measure for IU, both the original 27-item and the 12-item (IUS-12; Carleton, Norton, & Asmundson, 2007) versions. The present study, conducted in the context of a broader research project about IU and the COVID-pandemic by the UNiCORN team, aims to develop an even shorter version of the IUS, both psychometrically sound and quicker to administer, which would increase its utility in research studies with an elevated number of measures. Initial analyses conducted in currently available data from four countries (UK, Italy, Spain and Greece) suggest that it is possible to reduce the IUS-12 to 5 items, including two items measuring desire for predictability, one item assessing uncertainty paralysis, and two items describing aversiveness of uncertainty. The five-item version of the questionnaire (IUS-5) showed adequate internal consistency across languages (English, Italian, Spanish, Greek) and across situations (e.g., before and during COVID-19), and its total score is highly correlated with the total score of the IUS-12.

Study 2 (N= 105,857) replicated these findings using individual-level data, showing that several personality traits predict sheltering in place behavior, but extraverts are especially likely to remain mobile. Overall, our analyses reveal robust relationships between traits and regulatory compliance (mobility behaviour) both before and after region specific legislative interventions, and the global declaration of the pandemic.

Design and setting Longitudinal observational population study using data from the 2017 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2019 and April 2020 waves of Understanding Society, the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. Participants 12,090 men and women with a mean age of 49.9 (range 18 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 92) living in private households in the United Kingdom were drawn from the representative wave 9 (2017 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2019) sample of the UKHLS and followed up between the 24th and 30th of April 2020. Main outcome measure Mental health problems were measured using the General Health Questionnaire 12 (GHQ-12), a validated and widely used measure of common mental health symptoms in population studies. The GHQ-12 score cut-off (score of 3 or more) for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpsychiatric casenessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â (i.e. likely to present with psychiatric disorder) was used to estimate prevalence of mental health problems. Results The percentage of participants classified as experiencing mental health problems increased from 23.3% in 2017-2019 to 36.8% in April 2020. In a multivariate mixed effects logistic regression model all population subgroups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems. Increases were most pronounced among young adults, females, and those with a higher level of education. The rise in mental health difficulties was 8.6 percentage points (95% CI: 4.1 to 13.2) greater among those aged 18-34 compared to those aged 50 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 64, 6.9 points (95% CI: 4.0 to 9.8) greater in females compared to males and 4 points (95% CI: 1.2, 6.9) greater amongst those with a university degree compared to others. Additional analyses of the full UKHLS dataset from 2009-2020 showed that the substantial increase in mental health problems observed in April 2020 was unlikely to be due to seasonality effects or year-to-year variation.

China Experience in Controlling COVID-19,"At present, the epidemic situation of COVID-19 is raging rampantly in the whole world, affecting the hearts of billions of people. In less than half a year, COVID-19 swept the world, seriously threatening the safety of all mankind. At the beginning, the epidemic was most serious in China. Under the strong command of the highest level of the Chinese government, the whole Chinese people United as one, and achieved initial results in the struggle against covid-19 with scientific prevention and control. Summarizing China's experience and lessons in combating the epidemic is undoubtedly very beneficial to the people of the world in jointly combating the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. The most important experience is: strong organizational leadership, enhanced cooperation with the WHO, the establishment of a national anti-epidemic headquarters, responsible for the command and control of human, financial and material resources throughout the country, and local officials at all levels in the front line of the epidemic.

But, I would differ on a point that in a digitally divided country like India such impulses may escalate the divide further. The regular discussions on the materiality of smartphone possession as the new mantra to bridge the digital divide in India failed to take note of its spatial and infrastructural dimensions in times of crisis. The letter views spatial distance from the core urban areas as the factor that determines the mobile network availability. In times of pandemic when the services are officially declared as deploring the divide gets intensified for students. Firstly, the failed attempts of a student to join online classes deprive her/his of parity vis-ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â -vis students having relatively better access to the internet. Secondly, coupled with the multiple apprehensions, this deprivation would add to her/his collapsing mental health.",Swasti Vardhan Mishra,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46204-E10-C9A,20200603,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3178,FALSE,,
Turking in the time of COVID,"On March 16 2020, President Trump introduced strict social distancing guidelines for the United States, in an effort to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. This had an immediate major effect on the job market, with millions of Americans forced to find alternative ways to make a living from home. Here, we investigate the possibility that this policy also changed the pool of workers available to take part in academic studies on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ either by influencing which existing MTurk workers participate, or by causing an influx of new ones. Specifically, we look at 10,510 responses gathered in 16 studies run between February 25, 2020, and May 14, 2020, examining the distribution of gender, age, ethnicity, political preferences, and analytic cognitive style. We find important changes on all measures following the imposition of nationwide social distancing: participants are more substantially less reflective (as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test, CRT) and more Republican, and somewhat less likely to be white and experienced with MTurk. Most of these differences are explained by an influx of new participants who are somewhat less attentive than, and demographically different from, previous participants.",Antonio Alonso Arechar et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46072-FC4-67D,20200604,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3179,FALSE,,
Changes in daily loneliness during the first four weeks of the Covid-19 lockdown in Germany,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak has dramatically altered peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s social lives due to strict distancing policies. Increased loneliness has been publicly discussed as a harmful psychological side effect of these policies. However, empirical evidence was lacking. This large scale daily diary study assessed daily loneliness in N = 4,850 German adults from March 16, 2020 until April 12, 2020. Daily loneliness increased during the first two weeks of the Covid 19 lockdown and decreased thereafter. We identified subgroups that are at a higher risk for changes in daily loneliness during the Covid-19 pandemic (i.e., older adults, parents). It is important to evaluate if and how established knowledge about psychological functioning applies to extraordinary times and events such as the Covid-19 pandemic.",Susanne Buecker et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609D-C17-47B,20200604,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3180,FALSE,,
Managing wildlife trade for sustainable development outcomes after COVID-19,"The COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â19 pandemic has caused huge loss of life, and immense social and economic costs throughout the world. Policy responses must minimise the risk of future zoonotic pandemics while simultaneously securing livelihoods and protecting nature, all of which are fundamental to delivering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Wildlife trade has become the epicentre of debates on COVID-19 and potential policy responses, with calls from some conservation and animal welfare organisations for blanket bans on wildlife trade. Here we describe how wildlife trade influences people and nature in diverse ways (both positive and negative), with synergies and trade-offs within and between the SDGs. We also discuss why there is a need for a more holistic and evidence-based approach, which goes beyond the narrow focus of current discourse. We offer a simple integrated framework for assessing the public health risks of different forms of wildlife trade, and for evaluating them against other dimensions of the SDGs. We illustrate the flexibility of the framework by applying it to worked examples for different species and contexts. Our results demonstrate how the framework can guide evidence-based, participatory decision-making on wildlife trade, which minimises public health risks and secures other benefits to people and nature. We encourage decision-makers to adopt a holistic approach to inform national and local policy responses to pandemic risks posed by wildlife trade. Finally, we recommend that broader issues, such as land-use and climate change (and how wildlife trade regulations may alleviate or exacerbate these issues) are also considered as part of efforts to reduce future zoonosis emergence.",Hollie Booth et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619A-58E-7FC,20200604,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3181,FALSE,,
The best-case heuristic in risk prediction: Hopes and fears in a global health pandemic (COVID-19),"During the current global pandemic (Coronavirus/COVID-19), policy-makers and citizens in numerous countries have been unprepared to respond, or been responding too late. Why are so many people hesitant to take precautionary action? In three experiments on health risk prediction (N = 2,300 Americans), we identified two kinds of relative optimism. Participants reported their ""most realistic"" prediction of infection risk for themselves and the average person, and then made similar predictions either in a best-case scenario or a worst-case scenario. Consistent with a best-case heuristic, Study 1 showed that participants made ""realistic"" predictions that were closer to their own best-case scenario than to their worst-case scenario. The infection risk was also rated as lower for oneself than for the average person in all three scenarios, extending classic findings of comparative optimism to a broader space of possible outcomes. Study 2 was a pre-registered direct replication, in which both kinds of optimism were successfully replicated in a large representative sample. Correlational analyses revealed that higher risk predictions were associated with higher levels of emotional distress, but also with pro-social intentions and stronger support of public health lockdown policies. Although a clear (bipartisan) majority supported the lockdown policies, right-leaning conservatives made lower risk predictions and expressed lower policy support than left-leaning liberals. Resistance to lockdown policies was also associated with the belief in national superiority in pandemic preparedness. Study 3 was a pre-registered conceptual replication, finding that the best-case heuristic generalized to predicted waiting time for a COVID-19 vaccine and predicted relationship satisfaction.",Hallgeir SjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥stad et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46004-1FC-606,20200605,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3182,FALSE,,
Human-dog relationships during COVID-19 pandemic; booming dog adoption during social isolation,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to uncertainty and severe health and economic concerns, which may have impacted human-dog relationships. Our objectives were to investigate how people perceived and acted during the COVID-19 pandemic social isolation, in regards to dog adoption and abandonment; and to examine the bidirectional relationships between dog ownersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ well-being to that of their dogs. Overall, according to our analysis, the stricter the social isolation became during the pandemic, the interest in dog adoption as well as adoption rate increased significantly, while abandonment did not change. Moreover, there was a clear association between individualsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ impaired quality of life and their perceptions of poorer life quality of their dogs as well as the development of new behavioral problems. These findings suggest potential benefits for human-dog relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic, in compliance with the One Welfare approach.",Liat Morgan et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612C-9C4-6CD,20200605,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3183,FALSE,,
"Stress, functioning, and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from an online convenience sample","This study explored how individuals living in the United States were experiencing and responding to stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Participants (N = 408; 60% non-Hispanic White) completed an online survey regarding traumatic stress, functional impairment, and use of and perceived helpfulness of various coping strategies. Results showed that 37% of participants endorsed clinically-elevated PTSD symptoms. Approximately half of participants reported changes in their daily functioning from before the pandemic to present, most notably in their number of social interactions, physical activity, and time spent working. To cope, participants reported engaging in safety planning and behavioral activation, which they also perceived to be helpful in managing stress. Avoidance coping strategies involving use of alcohol, tobacco products, or recreational substances were infrequently endorsed and perceived to be minimally helpful. These findings offer an initial, data-based glimpse into the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and shed light onto opportunities for promoting mental health and well-being during this unprecedented and multifaceted crisis.",Alayna Park et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-4AF-3FF,20200605,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3184,FALSE,,
Psychological Networks can Identify Potential Pathways to Specific Intervention Targets for Anxiety in Response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),"Addressing mental health challenges related to the COVID-19 outbreak can be facilitated through research that characterizes the needs of subpopulations and identifies specific pathways to targeted intervention. Toward this aim, we examined the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on anxiety symptoms among college students (N = 487) and explored the relative impact of coping strategies using a psychological network approach, which models complex interactions to identify potential pathways to symptom-level intervention. Although students showed several significant fluctuations in pre- to post-outbreak anxiety symptom levels measured with the GAD-7, anxiety network connectivity was not significantly different across timepoints. Consistent with hypotheses, the post-outbreak symptom+coping network revealed that increased use of the adaptive coping strategies of acceptance, behavioral activation, and values-based action was associated with lower levels of fear, restlessness, and trouble relaxing. The symptom+coping network also revealed that increased use of the maladaptive strategies of excessive cleaning, reassurance seeking, and excessive checking was associated with higher levels of irritability and fear. Surprisingly, the use of reappraisal and avoidance, two strategies with putatively opposing adaptive value, highly overlapped and showed positive associations with fear and irritability. These symptom+coping associations can guide the assessment and treatment of anxiety in the face of COVID-19.",Santiago Papini et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46174-DCD-3D8,20200605,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3185,FALSE,,
A Timeline Response: How Does Islamic Organizations Respond to COVID-19 in Indonesia?,"Indonesia has made several regulations to end the pandemic, including PSBB. This regulation is related to physical distancing in all sectors and activities, including religious activities. To strengthen this policy, MUI and other Islamic organizations have made fatwa and official statement about how worships, especially those which are done in groups should be conducted during this pandemic. But efforts made by government and other organizations are not enough to ensure society that these regulations will not affect their religiousity. This paper is a literature review aimed to describe and analyze religious-related cases of COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. It includes MUI, Muhammadiyah, and Nahdlatul Ulama responses (fatwa and official statement) to this issue and public responses as well. It also compared this case to vaccine hesitancy case, due to similarities between these two cases. Both of these cases are dealing with religious dogma as it affects the policiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ effectivity. Religious and community leaders are needed in this kind of cases in order to help government promote and educate people about health issues from religious perspectives. Moreover, some kinds of punishment made by government are needed to strengthen fatwas and rulings, as most of these religious opinions do not have legal enforcement.",Aisyah Rahvy et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620D-CCF-88A,20200606,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3186,FALSE,,
Posttraumatic stress symptoms and associated comorbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland: A population based study,"The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as it relates to peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to determined. This study was conducted to determine rates of COVID-19 related PTSD in the Irish general population, the level of comorbidity with depression and anxiety, and sociodemographic risk factors associated with COVID-19 related PTSD. A nationally representative sample of adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) completed self-report measures of all study variables. The rate of COVID-19 related PTSD was 17.7% (95% CI = 15.35 - 19.99%: n=184), and comorbidity with generalized anxiety (49.5%) and depression (53.8%) was high. Meeting the diagnostic requirement for COVID-19 related PTSD was associated with younger age, male sex, living in a city, living with children, moderate and high perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and screening positive for anxiety or depression.

Pathogen Threat Increases Electoral Success for Conservative Parties: Results from a Natural Experiment with COVID-19 in France,"Conservative ideology is closely linked with pathogen prevalence, and adherence to conservative values increases under pathogen threat. To this day, few studies have demonstrated this effect using ecological data. For the first time, we analyse results from an election (the 2020 French local election) which was held during the growing COVID-19 spread in the country. Using mixed modelling on county-level data (N = 96), we show that perceived COVID-19 threat (search volume indices) but not real threat (prevalence rates) prior to the election are positively associated with an increase in conservative votes only. These results were robust to adjustment on several covariates including abstention rates, prior electoral scores for conservative parties and economic characteristics. Overall, a 1% increase in COVID-19 search volumes lead to an increase in conservative votes of .25%, 95%CI[.08,.41]. These results highlight the relevance of evolutionary theory for understanding real-life political behaviour and indicate that the current COVID-19 pandemic could have a substantial impact on electoral outcomes.",Jais Adam-Troian et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4601E-884-2A1,20200607,Psy- and SocArXiv,Exclude,,,,,,,,,,,,,FALSE,2020-06-15,,,3188,FALSE,,
